I saw that Barry Hart was in line to make a ton of money because he was almost close to Alex Rodriguez.</UTT>Best news for him, the stupid hat that makes baseball fun again.</UTT>I remember when A-Rod signed up, they went for almost $275 million a year. Not really.</UTT>And so far he's made altogether $440 million so far. I wonder what he's doing with the bulk of his wealth.</UTT>I think some of these players spent a lot of their money relatively quickly. I'm not sure Harper is worth it. I've watched a lot of the Nationals games.</UTT>Then how do you feel about letting Rendon go from the team?</UTT>If I remember correctly, negotiations with him went on for a long time.</UTT>I'm a huge Yankee fan, I don't know if the stadium is apparently good for left wingers.</UTT>I heard that, I also heard the same about the Boston stadium.</UTT>A-Rod ever played for Boston? I'll forget. I know he bounced around in his career before.</UTT>I honestly don't think he did. Harper had a terrible year last year. I think he averages around 250, which is really low.</UTT>Just like the fans of the Washington Nationals know that. You apparently know them very well.</UTT>I don't know if baseball could potentially be more popular in Japan than in the US.</UTT>I think they are the only nations with better players than the U.S. Imagine if we had a real world series.</UTT>That's pretty interesting, and also interesting is that if a need arises, the baseball manager can technically play with his team.</UTT>I wonder if that will ever happen. Maybe when Sandy Koufax refused to pitch at Yom Kippur.</UTT>I've not heard that name for a long time. I think he's playing in NY and LA.</UTT>With the old players, if we saved the back then and lived back then, neither of us could rack up $300,000 like some guy when he found a bunch of baseball cards in the early 20th century.</UTT>It's crazy that baseball cards hold their values on some of the really older cards. I'm not so sure nowadays though.</UTT>I think the rare pokemon cards may be worth more these days.</UTT>That is probably true, and they are now publishing way too many baseball cards.</UTT>1

Hey there, my friend drove a car?</UTT>I drive a car, you drive it?</UTT>I have a jetta, have you ever gone through a drive thru?</UTT>I did. You do what you do.</UTT>I do. Have you heard about the history of drive thrus?</UTT>I haven't. Do you know it?</UTT>You are right, McDonald's actually invented it and made it for the soldiers in uniform.</UTT>Wow, that's nice of them. I wonder when the trunk existed.</UTT>I don't know you, but it sounds like back in the day there was a wood trunk in the car that was a fire hazard.</UTT>And if you have flame throwers in your car, it's a disaster recipe.</UTT>Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha</UTT>I read that story in Maximum years ago and they also had a huge sword that cut off the legs of carjackers. Which is the worse way?</UTT>Hahaha, I think that sounds horrible either way, burns probably worse than I did, and what do you think?</UTT>I think I have burns too. I can still function without legs, but it's awful to lose all my nerve endings and have to rehab for months.</UTT>Yup, I've seen burn victims and their faces and skin always make me sad.</UTT>Do you know the area code of NYC because it's easy to dial?</UTT>Haha I did and dialed the number 212 fastest on a rotary phone.</UTT>Have you ever had a rotary phone?</UTT>haha I'm playing with one, only I have a cell phone right now. What about you?</UTT>I too. I had a rotary growing up and it was the worst when you misdialed, had to start over or had your finger slipped.</UTT>Hahaha, sounds horrible. What do you think of fish. I'd like to eat fish.</UTT>They are delicious smoked. Nice chat.</UTT>1

Do you know it?</UTT>And you make it for the soldiers in uniform.</UTT>Wow, that's easy on the car, I wonder what the finger was when the company existed.</UTT>I don't know you, but it sounds like back in the day there was a wood trunk in the car that was a fire hazard.</UTT>And if you have flame throwers in your car, it's a disaster recipe.</UTT>Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha</UTT>I read that story in Maximum years ago and they also had a huge sword that cut off the legs of carjackers.

Hello, do you use the internet a lot?</UTT>All the time. You suggested.</UTT>Same here, I think Ii is almost always connected when I'm at home. Do you know that the 3 horizontal line menus on the app and website call for a hamburger button? LOL</UTT>Ii and my colleague did not refer to it that, I've always just called it the menu button.</UTT>LOL, too. Three gigabit cell service and Internet capability at the peak of Mount Everest. That's amazing!</UTT>You know so you can check in and publish your accomplishments on facebook.</UTT>That's funny, only 7% of people read full terms when they buy products or services online. Do you read full terms? I went over it, but it looks like it's a minority.</UTT>I did vaguely so I'd probably agree with some sketchy stuff without even knowing it.</UTT>You only know that the general purpose computer in the space shuttle runs 1 megabyte of memory. Crazy.</UTT>Wow, I think what we have in the things we use to look at pictures of cats is something that is then that important. Crazy.</UTT>I don't even know if the Russians made water-running computers in 1936. I did know about computers around that early?</UTT>I didn't and wondered how powerful it was.</UTT>I'm not sure, but it's an interesting concept. Someone built a 16 bit work computer using basic minecraft blocks, nothing but a bore.</UTT>That really sounds like a lot of work.</UTT>I know, at the same time technology has come such a long way, and it's kind of frightening. The iphone has more computing power than the US' entire deterrent of ballistic missiles lol.</UTT>It's really, I remember going to school and the teachers said we don't have calculators in our pockets everywhere. They look wrong.</UTT>You're right, now when you mention Texas Instruments, I remember my calculator. I thought that was so high tech and it's not worth it now. United Support has a minute-use phone program to donate clean water to children in need.</UTT>Same here, I could definitely put it down to help out a good cause.</UTT>Same here, seems to be a contributing cause easy to use, I don't use that much of my phone. Little early history with rotary phones reveals the area code of New York because it dials the fastest. Wonder why they didn't pick the 121?</UTT>111 Why not give it to the EDD?</UTT>Good point, sure, I don't want one who has to lay phone and internet cables across the ocean. That must be the heck of a job.</UTT>I know that's a long way, even if they're only 2.7 inches thick. Nice chat. Have a good day.</UTT>1

Hello, remember the news story about the false missile alert in Hawaii last January?</UTT>That's crazy. Phone alert and it says no drilling specifically. Wow.</UTT>That's crazy, you think the government has some redundancy in the system so one person can trigger an alarm, what's your response? A missile is nuclear, that's an egregious mistake that cannot be forgiven.</UTT>Seriously, I'm so scared. I think it's great to have a government warning us about this, but it really shows that anyone can make mistakes.</UTT>Something serious needs to happen, like two key activation systems, which are needed to activate government officials. You can't take the alarm back when it's sent across the telephone. The government is for the government, but bureaucracy often trips their feet. Then there are the people who fake their government representation as a scam.</UTT>Yeah, good point, do you think the government should have less control than it does now? The US government owns 86 percent of the land in Nevada, I never knew that.</UTT>I know that, but a lot of it was for military training and also contained uranium ore. Outside Las Vegas and Reno the population was pretty sparse and scattered. What do you think of WikiLeaks and their philosophy of exposing government secrets?</UTT>I think it's good and bad. The government obviously needs to keep certain information classified but should be more transparent other times. I think Wikileaks did a big gut check to show how important it is to tell the truth and to protect classified information.</UTT>Someone leaked a plan of the government to destroy WikiLeaks apparently? I agree that some of the most sensitive strategic things need to be classified, but I think that is too much abuse for political purposes. Something isn't pulled back when it leaks these days with the internet?</UTT>Exactly. The internet is even powerful enough to cause brain-measured addiction.</UTT>I got rid of my landline phone and went for personal/business cellular/internet phones as my office/psuedo phones. So I could get calls and faxes on my laptop (Ii can get faxes on my office/psuedo phone numbers on my laptop) Do you still use the traditional landline phone service?</UTT>Good idea, I don't. The solicitors call me only if I have one anymore. There is no reason to have one anymore, especially since the iphone has more computing power than the entire nuclear industry deterrent.</UTT>You can do almost any common computer task with a smartphone. I still use my laptop because I have a fat finger and can't ever write a report on my smartphone (I like the way smartphones turn into Internet hubs) My office anywhere is doing that with my laptop.</UTT>Hahahahaha, but the phone is getting bigger yeah good point, internet is everywhere now, and lucky for Alexandria libraries to save copies for just the case.</UTT>Even Mount Everest has cell phones and the internet if you want to send a selfie from the peak. Do you do much shopping on the internet?</UTT>That's epic, I shop quite often on the internet (much more convenient than having to go to a store) I hate that they have a long page of terms and services when I buy online, apparently only 7% actually read them.</UTT>I stick to a few trusted sites because terms can vary between vendors, rather than buying from anyone on the internet who has the best price (you used to shop tax free on the internet). That day goes when Amazon and others collect it for sale.</UTT>Yea, research seems contradictory every week. But we should all agree on environmental saving like Norway. That's so amazing. The government surely needs to focus more resources on it.</UTT>Even non-profits challenge us to do more. You know UNICEF has a program to donate clean water every day at a minute rate without using a cell phone. I wonder how they figure that out.</UTT>That is also a great initiative, I think that is a positive end note. Great to talk to you. Have a great day.</UTT>Same with you, I hope the government wises up and develops a more bulletproof plan to control the alerts sent to our phones and the internet so we don't have another HI scare in my lifetime at least.</UTT>1

Have you watched Daredevil?</UTT>I saw it on netflix, but I didn't watch it?</UTT>I'm not. I'm not really into superhero series. I think Jesus Jones is OK.</UTT>I'm not, either, my husband only wants to watch a few movies. Nice to see Marvel Comics create a blue eye superhero for a 4 year old boy because he isn't comfortable wearing hearing aids.</UTT>That's nice. Dazedevil is in its third season so a lot of people have to like it.</UTT>NFC also accounts for 33 percent of Internet bandwidth between 19:00 and 10:00 in North America.</UTT>I'm guilty of contributing to that. I wind down on that. Half of North American Internet traffic is Facebook and YouTube together.</UTT>I'm an evening watcher as well. Wow, Blockbuster declined to purchase Netflix 5 years ago and it's worth $2 billion. Bet they regret that one.</UTT>I bet NFC still spends more on postage than bandwidth though I forgot they still offer to rent digital discs.</UTT>I used to participate in DVD rentals but it's just easier to rent or buy from udu, amazon prime or something.</UTT>Usually ii ran out of the content i watched for a few days but it gave me a little break. Then new content was available for ii to stream. i usually have no use for digital discs.</UTT>I agree. I think I've watched all the thrillers on NFC and Prime. Actually, the comic book series about fixing the collateral damage caused by the superheroes is funny.</UTT>You heard of the superhero called Normalman. He was the only person on a planet filled with superheroes who had no power.</UTT>I'm not. I have to look him up and I've never heard of him. Talk the odd one out, bet he feels really insecure on that planet.</UTT>It's an interesting concept, Daredevil's third season apparently is really good. I might have to check it out.</UTT>My goodness, there are actually over 300 registered superheroes in the United States.</UTT>quite that much. I wonder how many are Velvet and DC.</UTT>Good question. That one also has to be looked up. Garfield has a spinoff of the book series called Pet Force and it features him and his gang as funny superheroes.</UTT>I'd like to check that out. Garfield is hilarious.</UTT>I still enjoy watching Garfield and Scooby Doo. I remember staying up late at night with flashlights and reading 10 or 15 cent comic books about Superman and Batman.</UTT>Wow, that's amazing, what a great memory.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you?</UTT>I'm well, enjoy going to a concert?</UTT>I do, but sometimes they get overcrowded. Do you often go?</UTT>Not as often as I used to. I prefer smaller venues over large stadiums or arenas. In Croatia there is an ancient Roman amphitheatre still used as a concert venue. That might be neat to attend.</UTT>I've always seen them advertised on facebook. Do you often use facebook? I've been on facebook for about 13 years.</UTT>Wow, I didn't realize it was created only in 2004. It seems to have been around forever.</UTT>I know, and Myspace could only purchase it for 75 million dollars in 2005.</UTT>Serious. Their initial public value was $10 billion in 2012.</UTT>I heard that the creators of facebook are colorblind, red and green, so the logo is blue.</UTT>That's an interesting fact. They use Facebook to rewrite their constitution in Ireland and the public can suggest it. Pretty cool.</UTT>Facebook seems very interesting in that sense, and Burger King promotes not being friends with people because of free food.</UTT>Haha, I have a couple of friends who are not even friends with free food, there are states in Germany where like buttons are illegal.</UTT>Why do you think that's the case?</UTT>I have no idea. I didn't realize that Facebook was a directory given to American students often. I've never had one of them in college.</UTT>I guess Zimmerburg has had better ideas since he went to Harvard, so great.</UTT>I wasn't aware that Facebook was initially just for Harvard students.</UTT>I guess that makes sense on the kind of test scale, but it's pretty interesting.</UTT>Anyone over the age of 13 can now join. Seems pretty young.</UTT>That is way too young in my opinion, too easy for children to contact and not good.</UTT>There are too many creeps out there. I hear age requirements vary based on local laws.</UTT>That's good, but I think the law is so slow to adjust to technological change.</UTT>1

Hi, have you watched the NBA?</UTT>Hi, yes, I'm excited for March Madness, but I don't have a favorite team, do I?</UTT>I don't have one either. Do you know Reggie Miller?</UTT>I often confuse him with Reggie Bush, but Miller is a basketball guy. Is he famous for anything?</UTT>Well he's a superstar but his sister has always been better.</UTT>His sister played for the WNBA?</UTT>I'm not sure. She could have broken the national record eight times.</UTT>Wow, that's not an easy feat to accomplish Allen Irving. The same thing happened to Allen Irving. He was smart to sign a Reebok contract to pay him $800k a year until he was 55, so he got a lump sum of $32 billion.</UTT>Sometimes they can make so much money. Do you know Tim Duncan?</UTT>Yes, he still plays for the Spurs, I used to really like him.</UTT>I think he retired, I may be wrong, but apparently he decided to stay in college and finish before going to the NBA.</UTT>Wow, I think he was one of the few. But I guess they don't need to make millions to get endorsements because they can make millions. For example, Lebron James rejected a $1 million offer and accepted 90 million from Nike after the first year.</UTT>Sure a smart businessman. Do you know what a granny stylized?</UTT>Yes, of course. I wish the pro basketball player had a granny style shooting fame and I want to see someone incorporate that technique in one of the games.</UTT>And only because it looks fun, do they not do tjats. Who cares, just score.</UTT>Yeah, you think the name makes it embarrassing for a masculine player to use it. Even physicists have proven that granny style is the best technique.</UTT>Yeah exactly, have you watched much TV?</UTT>I enjoy watching TV, watching dramas is my favorite genre. What?</UTT>I like them. Have you ever watched House?</UTT>I used to watch it all the time and it's crazy to think someone portraying a doctor would make more than an actual doctor. I think he makes over 700,000 per episode.</UTT>He makes so much money, but sure it's a good show. Nice to chat to you.</UTT>1

Do you know Tim Duncan?</UTT>Yes, he still plays for the Spurs, I used to really like him.</UTT>I think he retired, I may be wrong, but apparently he decided to stay in college and finish before going to the NBA.</UTT>I think a few of the sisters are either. But I guess they don't need to make $1 million for endorsements because they portray $1 million as a sum. For example, Lebron James rejected the $1 million offer and accepted 90 million from Nike after the sum of $1 million.</UTT>Sure a smart businessman. Do you know what a granny stylized?</UTT>Yes, of course. I wish the pro basketball player had a granny style shooting fame and I want to see someone incorporate that technique in one of the games.</UTT>And only because it looks fun, do they not do tjats. Who cares, just score.</UTT>Yeah, you think the name makes it embarrassing for a masculine player to use it. Even physicists have proven that granny style is the best technique.</UTT>Yeah exactly, have you watched much TV?</UTT>I enjoy watching TV, watching dramas is my favorite genre. What?</UTT>I like them. Have you ever watched House?</UTT>I used to watch it all the time, it's crazy to think someone portraying a doctor would make more than an actual doctor. Hi, I'm not excited about March Madness, yes, but I don't have a favorite team.</UTT>He makes so much money, but sure it's a good show. Nice to chat to you.</UTT>0
Hello, like Lady Gag?</UTT>I think she's fascinating. The movie she did with Bradley Cooper was great.</UTT>I didn't see it, but I liked the song from it. Her name came from a prediction text glitch that changed the radio from lady to lady.</UTT>Very interesting. The star was born well so you should watch it. Bradley Cooper made his directorial debut.</UTT>I definitely checked that out. I guess the band she's in favor of is the Iron Maiden.</UTT>I don't guess that either. She appears to have 113.4 million followers on twitter.</UTT>That seems to be the more obvious assumption. The LAPD also asked her to tweet them some roadwork once.</UTT>Wow, I've never heard of using followers like that.ltonjohn chose Lady Gag as his son's godmother. I don't know if they are close.</UTT>I don't either. Do you remember the boiling point of the show on MTV? Lady Gag was on MTV before she was famous?</UTT>I vaguely remember that show. I must have looked it up. She is now one of the best music sales artists in history. I bet she will reminisce about those boiling point days.</UTT>Absolutely. The Queens guitarist has a doctorate in astrophysics, speaking to a famous artist.</UTT>I remember that from Bohemian Rhapsody. Have you seen it? He also used coins as guitar picks.</UTT>I haven't seen that one either. I seem really behind the movie. The guitarist at the Museum holds the world record for most guitars smashed on tour.</UTT>I should have seen that movie as well. Wow, that must be a lot. Eddie Van Halen once set studio speakers on fire.</UTT>That's crazy, Pink floyd turned a grand houseboat into a floating recording studio. That sounds awesome.</UTT>That sounds very awesome. I bet the Thames never saw such a party.</UTT>I bet Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone. So they are busy people.</UTT>Wow, indeed very busy. It would be nice to have such a successful debut album.</UTT>Yeah, they were pretty popular in the early 2000s. The Ramones played 226 concerts in total.</UTT>That's also a lot of concerts. I like going to a concert, but the loud amplifying sound of an electric guitar is very deafening. Thanks for talking to me this afternoon.</UTT>It might get pretty loud, nice to chat with you.</UTT>Have a great afternoon bye</UTT>1

Hello,</UTT>Hi, who are you? Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>I use Youtube on my phone most of the time. I used to listen to radio a lot more.</UTT>I listened when I was a kid, now I don't. I use a computer.</UTT>Yeah, I use my computer right now.</UTT>There is a website where you can listen to thousands of classic radio drama episodes for free. I wonder who visited that site. It's probably a generation older.</UTT>I think it might be kind of cool to listen to a couple of them.</UTT>There are probably some good stories there. Did you listen to Latin news?</UTT>Nope, I can't understand it. If I tried to learn Latin, I could.</UTT>Finland's radio station has been broadcasting a weekly news program called nuntii latini, conducted entirely in classical Latin.</UTT>Do you know they made the radio when they fought in WW2?</UTT>I expect troops to use radio during WW2. They need communication.</UTT>They make their own radios using razorblades and pencils and diobes.</UTT>That's quite clever, I can't do it, it's a necessity that mothered the invention, I wonder what they could pick up.</UTT>What's probably radio or a bunch of German stuff?</UTT>I wonder if they can hear the storm on Jupiter?</UTT>Not sure. Do you know that a lightning bolt is 5 times hotter than the sun?</UTT>The surface of the sun is probably much cooler than the interior. I wonder if we can harness that lightning energy.</UTT>That or effectively harnessing the sun's rays.</UTT>The sun produces enough energy to meet the needs of the entire planet for the 500000 years it has been in existence. I wonder how much of that energy we can capture and store.</UTT>I think solar needs a lot of work then.</UTT>Solar promises a lot, I enjoyed the chat anyway.</UTT>I have to. Tylen.</UTT>1

Hi, have you heard of that shopping mall that hires hawks to get rid of the Pigeon problem?</UTT>Hello, who are you? I haven't heard of a shopping mall that hires hawks to get rid of pigeon problems.</UTT>They use it every 12 days a month and it decreases the pigeons from a few to just a few.</UTT>That was great, the hawks were terrific hunters, I hired those hawks to get rid of my neighbors.</UTT>Hahaha, too. Birds are great. Some birds can migrate from Alaska to Mexico.</UTT>I figure I can have enough time too. But I have to sleep way too. I can't stay away. The trip is boring.</UTT>Good point. Most birds have hollow wings.</UTT>I think bones are hollow because they are lighter (by coincidence, bones are also stronger) but my skull doesn't work the same way.</UTT>I don't either. The only known bird without wings is an extinct moa and an elephant bird.</UTT>Moa and elephant birds. What is an elephant and how big are its poops. It wouldn't fly.</UTT>Good question, but I'm not sure. Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct their nests.</UTT>I think hummingbirds are stealing birds. Why do they have to take our humble friends spiders?</UTT>Haha they must love the web, they don't consider themselves the best friends of men like a dog.</UTT>Dogs don't steal spider webs either. I appreciate their integrity.</UTT>I too. Dogs are color blind, but they can't see as many colors as we can.</UTT>I'm proud of my ability to see in color, but dogs can hear better and smell. I think dogs are a great addition to any war party.</UTT>Yep absolutely right. I think how dogs are bred to be wolves is cool.</UTT>I think we'll find our true friends with dogs. I think wolves are jealous of our friendship with dogs. They should be. Dogs are pretty sweet.</UTT>Yea, that's no doubt. Dogs perform many roles, ranging from hunting to herding and friendship.</UTT>I think they should help us with more financial advice and taxation anyway, great chat! Woof!</UTT>And remember Google is also a dog company, bye, too.</UTT>1

Hi, do you love dogs?</UTT>Hey there, you like horror movies, can you believe that Stephen King thought that Babies was a horror movie? It's really sad, but I wouldn't say it's scary.</UTT>Horror films. Well, if a horror film helps you burn more calories, it would be nice to think of watching "Bambi" as part of a good diet plan.</UTT>Haha that's a good plan, sorry to miss your first question, I need a dog so I can walk to burn calories and then we can watch a horror movie to cuddle and I also burn calories because I did that.</UTT>Nice, you know watching horror films before going to the museum helps you appreciate abstract art better, but don't take a dog to the museum, they have a different response to seeing a 65 year old dinosaur skeleton, they think it's a bone. Thanks,</UTT>I'm sure I didn't do that, I also feel bad, they're not colorblind at least, but they definitely can't see the color as well as humans can. That's weird.</UTT>God's way of trying to even the playing field. Dogs can smell better, run faster, jump higher, hear better than we can. But dogs do see more colors. At least that's God's way.</UTT>Hahahaha I like that too. I also like Google preferring dogs over cats. Amazingly they put that into their company policies so I like them.</UTT>Nice. Google is awesome but the dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to understand the point instinctively so they made a good choice not to make their own official animals of their own choosing. They need bigger offices.</UTT>Haha, that seems so interesting. Why don't gorillas know the point? Don't think of laughing loudly, they are smart and everything. We should do what Sanbul did with a stray dog, but you heard that.</UTT>Their dog food vending machine in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. Nice idea. I might start doing that with breakfast cereal.</UTT>Haha, you should do that. Dogs are so cool though, I love that they drive dog blood, the 12 different types of dog blood are crazy, do you think they get treats when they give blood?</UTT>I do. They also do, but my dog doesn't care about orange juice. I tried explaining that 80% of the earth's rain forests go, so don't knock orange juice until you try it, but my dog still doesn't get it.</UTT>haha such poor doggo, sad all the forests are gone, and also weird that we'll run out of helium at the end of the 21st century, what do all the balloon stores use to fill up the balloons?</UTT>Of course, flatulence. I explain this concept to my dog, but he doesn't fart a balloon at me. I frustrately exclaimed that human history is only 1 minute 17 seconds. My dog responded, "Why does it take over a minites to refill my bowl?"</UTT>You need to create a store selling dog fart balloons haha I guarantee someone will buy them for you. You think the United Nations has ambassadors who have to have a really lonely job.</UTT>Yeah, and it's difficult to train for impending invasions. How many times can one watch Mars Atlas and anyway, if our sun system is the most dense planet, would any sense alien want to stop off and speak to dense earthlings?</UTT>Haha I agree with you, too, nice to bring up Mars Attacks, long ago I didn't think it was an almost horror movie, I could burn 180 calories if I watched it again (by the way, you've never seen The Shining).</UTT>Yes, you can't watch a nice film with the whole family, you can't let them know it's a horror film until they grow up, just like they did with the actors playing their little roles in Danny.</UTT>I know right, I'm so happy he doesn't know he's in a horror movie, that definitely messes him up, you hear water phones and no water running phones lol.</UTT>No, what is a water phone, this is not a joke about how 71% of the earth is covered, so you are bound to reach the water even by telephone.</UTT>Haha I wish it was a joke, but it's actually an instrument, it makes weird creepy metallic noises you hear in horror movies, lol I might have to buy one.</UTT>1

Hello, are you watching TV?</UTT>I do. I watch the Big Bang Theory and national news.</UTT>I love the big bang theory, I'm a few seasons behind. lol</UTT>Have you watched Saturday Night Live?</UTT>No really, do you know about 750 episodes of pokemon?</UTT>I did. That was a lot of episodes.</UTT>It was like 16 years of episodes.</UTT>Apparently most deals made on shark tanks have never been enacted.</UTT>That's sad because TV is so fake.</UTT>I think it is. I watch it from time to time when nothing else is better.</UTT>Would you like to travel? I heard the Netherlands made high speed commuter buses traveling 160 mph.</UTT>I do. I go to the Netherlands twice. That bus is too fast for me. I have no plans to ride it.</UTT>LOL Really. Crossing the japan takes 300 dollars toll.</UTT>I can't afford that, I took the train instead.</UTT>Right, not to mention it's hard for me to drive on the opposite side of the road.</UTT>I heard of a website for people that lets you crash on their couch while you travel. Do you know what it is?</UTT>I think it's called Cabinsurfing.com or something like that. I've never used it though, I don't mind it.</UTT>I don't like staying in strangers houses, I've never stayed at an Airbnb either.</UTT>Wow, I've stayed at a lot of Airbnbs and even a hotel. I wouldn't mind it, especially if I needed to save money for more important travel expenses.</UTT>I'm female and I'm old. I'm not as courageous as young people.</UTT>Fair enough. Great to chat with you. Thanks for the conversation.</UTT>1

Hello, are you interested in cricket?</UTT>Hello, I think cricket is interesting, although I have never played. I think cricket is one of the only games I can think of that has 11 players on the field at a time.</UTT>Sounds interesting that the players on the bat scoring runs by striking the wicket ball with the bat and trying to prevent and dismiss each player to get out.</UTT>That's interesting. I mean, I mean, each team has 11 players on the field at a time. I don't know the International Cricket Council. What do you do?</UTT>I heard that. I also heard that all the cricket teams born in the US in Cambridge have won the British cup twice.</UTT>That's awesome, Australia seem to be doing very well in cricket with all four world cups winning by 45 percent.</UTT>Not only that, but the Australians also appeared in all three finals for 63% and won 71%.</UTT>I heard that somewhere. But the diplomatic consequences for England and Australia appear to be using nasty tactics against the best cricketers in history. Sounds like this game could be serious.</UTT>It may have got nasty and gone for a really long time as well, apparently. In 1939 England v South Africa in the longest single-day cricket match in cricket history.</UTT>That's a really long match, I wonder if people will stay to watch. Interesting name, like Napoleon Einstein, an Indian professional cricketer.</UTT>I think that's cool too. They keep playing until the 10 players are dismissed, then end the innings and sway the role. That 14 day game exhausts the players. The extras will probably come from each side to pull that off.</UTT>They must. I think it would be interesting to see cricket spread to the globe as the British Empire expanded.</UTT>I think cricket is played in most other countries besides the US where football reigns as a national pastime in sporting arenas.</UTT>Football is extremely popular in America, so people with successful sporting careers are probably often associated with celebrity status.</UTT>That is certainly true. Celebrity status is often associated with wealth (fame and fortune) but fame provides more often opportunities to earn revenue status. Football certainly lends itself well to the celebrity status mentioned above.</UTT>I think LeBron James, who is following Judy as the judge, is the most paid celebrity in football, even though it is popular.</UTT>Wow, I agree with that too, Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode, then I just wonder how much Lebron James rakes in.</UTT>Right, I can't believe that. Celebrities also get special perks like a secret room in a Disney studio that they can visit. I wonder if the judge, Judy, or Lebron James, will ever visit there.</UTT>Good question, they're both probably there, celebrity status gives many perks that the common person never knew about. I know Caroline Burke who appeared on Sesame Street is the first celebrity I've ever known. I bet Elmo and the rest of the gang were really honored.</UTT>She's pretty funny Robin Williams started the trend of celebrities performing vocals in animated films in Aladdin. Funny actors.</UTT>He is such a funny person, other countries also have celebrities, Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who thinks that by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse food, Ethiopia can combat its country's hunger problem.</UTT>1

Interesting name, like Napoleon Einstein, an Indian professional cricketer.</UTT>I go for cricket 'cool'. They are popular to play until 10 players are able to play, then field innings and have a role. 14 days of cricket is a truth value. The country people will probably come to each side to pull off the truth.</UTT>They must.

Funny actors.</UTT>He is such a funny person, other countries also have celebrities, Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who thinks that by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse food, Ethiopia can combat its country's hunger problem.</UTT>0
Have you ever heard of "The Book of Lists"? It was published back in 1977.</UTT>I can have, guess from the title it's full of a list of varying categories?</UTT>Haha, I sure don't know, but that's a good guess. I don't know why people read the list in books, but you can read it on the internet. Ever use the internet?</UTT>Ha ha I actually love the list. I use the internet constantly.</UTT>Have you used the hamburger button before if you used it constantly?</UTT>I'm not sure. What hamburger button?</UTT>It's a menu button, it looks like three horizontal lines. I think Reddit actually has it on their website.</UTT>I know that button, I use it a lot. I have no idea what it is about. On iii, I have no idea what it is about. At the international station, astronauts are aware that the Internet is connected faster than most Americans?</UTT>I don't know about that. I wish I had their internet though. Have you ever read the term "service" when you use the internet by the way?</UTT>I'm super guilty of not reading them.</UTT>Yep, too, you've ever climbed Mount Everest by the way, good to know they have 3 volt service at peak.</UTT>I am amazed that you can get the internet there. I wonder how it can happen. I still can't climb it though haha.</UTT>The internet is really amazing, if it ever goes down, the library of Alexandria will actually run a backup of the internet. (LAUGHTER LAUGHTER huge files will have to be done!).</UTT>I can't imagine how much storage space that would take.</UTT>I wonder how many people are addicted to the internet for clicking links, so I'll probably laugh out loud.</UTT>I'm definitely down several rabbit holes in the internet. Do you know what it is called to look you up on the internet?</UTT>I think it's called ego surfing, hmm, I definitely do that once or twice haha. BTW, do you like dogs?</UTT>It's i love dogs, i actually love all animals.</UTT>Well, I don't know if dogs have 12 different types of blood, they also drive dog blood?</UTT>I have no idea. I'm glad they drive, because they mean a lot of blood to save lives for that many different types.</UTT>Yes, I agree, I just hope they get the cookies after the drive, I even like to know that Google is an official dog company because they put it into their code of conduct.</UTT>1

I just found out that Curry and Lebron are both from the same city in Ohio, akron. That's crazy.</UTT>I'm a huge fan of both of them.</UTT>I have no idea. I'm not a huge fan, but I can enjoy odd games. What's your root?</UTT>I've always rooted for the Golden State and Stephen.</UTT>That's pretty cool. I'm so surprised to find out Curry doesn't get the highest salary, not even close.</UTT>He didn't, but he had what could have ended up being a $1 billion deal with Under Armour.</UTT>Oh absolutely. I understand Nike trying to sign Durant, but they did a terrible job. They even had Durant's name on the presentation.</UTT>I've seen that story. That's insane and a complete show of incompetence.</UTT>Yeah, the money going into this thing is crazy. Even when you lose the game, the team makes money off of the promotion/advertising stuff.</UTT>Do you know his dad is on the NBA team as well?</UTT>Yeah, his dad was Wardell, and Curry was actually Warren Stephen Curry II, right?</UTT>He was called short Dell though, he was usually in the game.</UTT>Yeah, I guess some family events are happening. Just like Reggie Miller with her sister.</UTT>LOL, his daughter seems to always steal the spotlight.</UTT>I know it's crazy, he scored 40 points and she scored 105. How do you even outscore that?</UTT>I mean, she's so cute everyone notices her more than Stephanie.</UTT>Oh sorry, you mean Curry's sister?</UTT>No, I'm talking about Curry's young daughter.</UTT>Oh, I see. That's sweet though, so she must be into basketball too, like he is?</UTT>She might be quite funny in front of the media and the camera.</UTT>That's so awesome, how was she somehow involved with the Curry foundation? That donated mosquito nets?</UTT>3 net points per 3 points, that's such a wonderful idea.</UTT>1

What are you enjoying for entertainment?</UTT>I enjoy catching up on news and listening to music, although I've only dabbled in jazz music recently. You?</UTT>I enjoy jazz as well, especially since it keeps its core, but absorbs local music culture to derive distinctive styles.</UTT>Hitler once suppressed jazz, which he condemned as degenerate because it was associated with composers and musicians of black and Jewish descent, but I'm happy we've come a long way since then.</UTT>You know that Henry Ford also tried to suppress jazz by funding country music instead, because it was the very same urban decadence.</UTT>Wow, I don't know about that, and I wonder really interestingly if you can tell the difference between jazz music by geography (New Orleans Jazz, Kansas City Jazz, Gypsy Jazz).</UTT>Jazz is still jazz. They are distinct but like the core.</UTT>I see a wish I could sing like the great jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, who even taught herself to sing two notes at once at the age of 18.</UTT>What instrument do you play because you are interested in jazz?</UTT>I used to play guitar, but when one of my strings broke I quit. Do you play any instrument?</UTT>You play by hand, pick or coin. I dabble in piano and violin here and there.</UTT>I don't know if you can play coins. I strum it with my finger or pick. A very tiny guitar built by a Cornell researcher that needs to be played with lasers. I wonder why they invented that.</UTT>Probably just because they can.</UTT>Amazing how things go to make sound. Queen Brian May built her guitar from parts from an old fireplace and her mother's knitting needles. I say ouch.</UTT>I wonder how it sounds. Eddie van Halen set his speakers on fire as they soloed to beat it on a sperate note.</UTT>Wow, that could be. Is it an accident or entertainment?</UTT>I think he taxed the speech until it burst into flames. He didn't intend to at least destroy instruments like Matthew Bellamy, who holds the Guinness world record for most guitars smashed on tour.</UTT>I think that could get a small price for the entertainment revenue it brings, but it's very expensive. Olsen Twins purchased an entertainment company back in the early 2000s and turned it into a multi-billion dollar company. No wonder I don't hear of them anymore.</UTT>This person is very dedicated, the Pink Floyd guitarist even made a floating recording studio.</UTT>It might take that long to get a perfect vibrato sound on his record. Did any notable recordings be produced in that floating studio?</UTT>Not sure if it's called Astoria. Well, thanks for the chat, and I hope you have a good time also.</UTT>1

Do you like Fifth Harmony?</UTT>I haven't heard of it, what is it?</UTT>They are a band and sing "Work From Home".</UTT>They seem to take advice and break while working at home.</UTT>Yeah, it's not a bad idea, everyone gets burnt out sometimes.</UTT>What kind of music do they play? That's not a band created by Diddy.</UTT>I think it's like pretty good pop/rap stuff.</UTT>Is it anything like Psy's gangnam style? That gets so many views they have to upgrade the view counter to 64 bits int.</UTT>No, but I like the gangnam style. Do you know that YouTube is the second largest search engine on the net?</UTT>Behind Google. Google doesn't own youtube. If they do, it seems logic to them. If they do, they make half the peak internet traffic.</UTT>It's crazy, isn't it? Yeah they do. Justin Bieber's song is the most disliked on youtube. Hmm...</UTT>Why do they hate Biebs? I hate to admit that if one of his good songs comes on, I'll jam on it. But it's only like two songs and neither is baby.</UTT>I honestly don't know any of his music.</UTT>Ha, well let me redeem myself. You know Fluffy recorded a live album in Powellii with no one there.</UTT>I didn't realize the volcano was going off where.</UTT>Yeah, like Pink Fluffy?</UTT>OK, they are. I didn't listen to them long ago though.</UTT>What about creeds? You don't listen to them.</UTT>They are OK, but I hear bad things about them live.</UTT>Yeah, it's bad you get sued by your fans.</UTT>Yeah, hilarious, nice chat with you.</UTT>1

Hey there, what do you think of our current government system? I was shocked to learn that most of Nevada is owned by the US government.</UTT>I really wonder what they did with all 86 percent of the land.</UTT>I know right, most of Nevada is desert, but I still know it. Have you heard of the man selling the Eiffel Tower twice? It's risky.</UTT>Haha I wonder how he gets away with it twice haha. Do you know what Wikileaks is?</UTT>I heard about WikiLeaks, did they not publish a plan for the government to try and destroy them? That is so insane.</UTT>Yeah they have to have a man inside. Have you heard the Norwegian government is planning to save the rainforest?</UTT>I didn't. I heard the U.S. passed laws protecting government employees from being persecuted if they violated the Geneva Convention, which seems really weird.</UTT>That's weird, the Norwegians donated 1 billion dollars, a whole lot of money.</UTT>I know right, by the way, how many times have you traveled? You've ever been to Norway.</UTT>I'm not actually, but would like to visit at some point. On the island I have to get a car as well.</UTT>apparently iasn't a public rail country, you just fly between cities, maybe you don't need a car lol</UTT>If that makes it cheaper, sure, they can get one of their Dutch buses that goes 160 mph.</UTT>Haha, I definitely ride that. I don't ride the Japanese highway system. They are all private and have a toll.</UTT>And your travels to the country cost $300.</UTT>Yep exactly, that sounds really annoying. Have you ever been to Michigan?</UTT>I would never like to go into how that works with any motorized vehicle, but it must have been so peaceful there.</UTT>Oh, I agree with you, but it also smells like a horse everywhere haha. I'm there, no cars, just horses.</UTT>I guess that could have a downside. Do you know that the King is the first one to travel the world?</UTT>Isn't the King of Hawaii? I wonder what made him do it? What do you think?</UTT>That's him, yup. I'm not sure why he did it, do you know that Venus doesn't tilt?</UTT>Wow, I don't know that. BTW, I missed Pluto, Venus also appears to rotate clockwise.</UTT>1

Have you ever played a video game?</UTT>I didn't, but my son played with them. If I let him he would have played more.</UTT>My things do, too. If I let him, he'd be a constant. He'd love to play multiplayer Fortnite.</UTT>That's my son's drug. He plays a bunch of other video games, but if he's allowed to just play Fortnite, he's playing a bunch of other games.</UTT>Yep, my things are addicted too. Do you know that the first multi-player shooter uses music protocol for networking?</UTT>I don't know that, you're saying that now, I have to admit I don't really know what that means. Do you have a phone yet?</UTT>We all have phones, we all have cell phones.</UTT>I mean my son wants a cell phone but we haven't let him yet, we have to get him soon because most of his friends have one.</UTT>Yep, I have a 7th grader and a senior high school for the phone, we got my youngest phone at the end of 5th grade because he moved to middle school. You know the area code of NY because dialing in the area code number of the area code.</UTT>Why does New York get a choice? I work in school and kids are on the phone at every opportunity, but I suppose that is a modern world. Just like Netflix replacing Blockbuster.</UTT>They are constantly in them. What about Blockbusters declining to buy Netflix for $5 billion? It is now worth $2 billion. Not so smart in hind sight.</UTT>Someone has to kick himself, like the Beatles turned down before they made it. We have been cutting our cable about 2 years now, don't miss it in any way.</UTT>It's so expensive I'd prefer to have NFC. You know that NFC and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America. I doubt it.</UTT>I can well believe it if I think about how I use the internet mainly to watch YouTube or Netflix.</UTT>I think how Netflix came about is funny. It all started with a late fee of $40 for Apollo 13.</UTT>They aren't always upset with your customers. I understand that one or two Blockbusters are still in Alaska where the Internet is as wide available. It probably still just matters.</UTT>Yep, I bet Alaska is way behind time. The Internet capability may not be that great in such a huge area.</UTT>I wonder how cell phones are covered there. Kids in Alaska may not be as addicted to their phones and social media as they are to their phones.</UTT>You can only hope. I can't pry my kids away from their electronics. Not a good thing.</UTT>Kids get sneaky too. It's hard to stay ahead of them with these fake apps and secondary social media pages. My kids are already clever.</UTT>Myself, myi, and Snap, the worst. Good talk today. Have a good day.</UTT>Same here, have a good day, bye.</UTT>1

Hey, have you ever seen the film "Island of dogs" directed by Wes Anderson?</UTT>That's the one where the dogs fight on the island. Seems a bit sketchy for a kid movie.</UTT>That's the one. Not actually a bad movie, I like it and it's rated not too much violence or anything from what I've seen.</UTT>Yes, but there is definitely language for non-children in it.</UTT>Also, the reference to the dog being heated is kind of weird because it's a clay animation, but I think it's okay for kids to watch it.</UTT>I must check it out. Any movie with a dog is not all that bad. After all, they are the best friends of the man.</UTT>They are. There are also 12 different types of dog blood, I wonder if it's blood driven for them.</UTT>Surgery animals need blood too do you know that Russia has a tomb of unkategorical dogs?</UTT>I don't know what dogs do, I also don't know if dogs are actually blind. They just can't see all the colors a human can see.</UTT>Right, because there are dogs in Moscow riding the subway and they can't tell which line they're in without color.</UTT>That's possible. You think dogs or elephants only can't understand the point. I wonder why they can't understand the point, gorillas or even dolphins, but they are also smart?</UTT>I'm not sure, but dogs can learn over 1000 words and have more reason than chimps. That surprised me.</UTT>Ever put a dog in your car before? I like it when they let the wind flop their ears around?</UTT>Yes, it's fun. Last week I followed a horse truck down the road doing the same thing. The dog was so smart because he loved solving problems and earning rewards.</UTT>I drove my car with my dog and we actually stopped driving. I never knew that the drive started in 1975.</UTT>It's right that McDonalds did it to help the soldiers. That's nice to them.</UTT>Yes, I agree. Soldiers can't get out of their cars if they wear fatigue, so McDonald's created a drive up window, and we should let Burner King put flamethrowers in our cars so we can get the taste of flame grilling to go.</UTT>LOL I know, I wonder if Google's car with aggressive mode comes with flamethrowers.</UTT>Well, that makes me scared to drive a car. What about the trunk of a car. You don't know the name of that.</UTT>Actually, the early 1900's car didn't have a wood trunk. They probably should have avoided flamethrowers.</UTT>Haha good point on that. I used to play this video game called Gran Turismo back in the day and someone seems to have gotten so good after playing that they became real race car drivers.</UTT>1

Soldiers can't get out of their cars if they wear fatigue, so McDonald's created a drive up window, and we should let Burner King put flamethrowers in our cars so we can get the taste of flame grilling to go.</UTT>LOL I know, I wonder if Google's aggressive-mode car comes with flamethrowers. Yes, but definitely not for children in it.</UTT>Well, that makes me scared to drive a car. What about the trunk of a car. You don't know the name of that.</UTT>Actually, the early 1900's car didn't have a wood trunk. They probably should have avoided flamethrowers.</UTT>Haha good point on that. I used to play this video game called Gran Turismo back in the day and someone seems to have gotten so good after playing that they became real race car drivers.</UTT>0
Hey there, are you interested in nature much?</UTT>It's about the same as the average person. I don't mind short hikes in the woods or sitting in the river trying to catch some fish.</UTT>Nice. Sounds fun. Do you know of fish species that can eat twice their size prey?</UTT>I'd like to see what they look like after a meal. Like I felt after Thanksgiving.</UTT>Haha, so true, they are called swallows in black, which is fitting.</UTT>Jellyfish are fish? I heard jellyfish are immortal.</UTT>That's one species of jellyfish that scientists studied for so long to try to crack their secret. I guess it's sometimes hard to tell what a fish is like a seahorse.</UTT>I just don't know how you know something is immortal.</UTT>They have to study them for so long. They have done a lot of the same experiments with zebra fish.</UTT>In terms of science and up-to-date technology, it turns out that the White House still uses floppy disks to store dates.</UTT>The old school is, but there must be good reasons for it. It is a speech that it has twin buildings in Ireland and France.</UTT>I wonder why that happened and who built them. I used to live in DC. We always look forward to seeing trees go up around the White House.</UTT>I actually don't know, and also wonder who lives there. You get a good chance to see it now. They are apparently banned from the White House by Rosenevlet.</UTT>Yeah, a bit of a conservationist, they donate one billion dollars to amazon rain forests just like the Norwegians.</UTT>That's a lot of money, but the US government has really shifted its focus to protecting its employees from prosecution if they violate Geneva conventions.</UTT>I wonder if seeing a national monument is against the Geneva Convention. A man in France pretends to work for the government and sells the Eiffel Tower once a second.</UTT>Wow, that's just insane. Do you know when the white houses started using them for the president's house?</UTT>I've understood since John Adams. Is he the second president?</UTT>That house has to have a lot of maintenance. I wonder if they still have the sun panels put back by Bush?</UTT>I'd like to think Bush installed them up there, wearing his tool belt and cursed that things didn't go right. You think Democrats put up with solar.</UTT>Well, you're there hahaha Nice to chat with you, have a good one.</UTT>1

It would be good to see Peterson do so well again for the Redskins.</UTT>3) Straigh victory</UTT>I hope his shoulder doesn't affect his playing.</UTT>Yeah, what about Trent Williams, he's playing with a dislocated thumb.</UTT>I think playing with shoulder injuries might be harder than with thumb injuries.</UTT>Well yes, in my book it's not fun to have any injuries when trying to play.</UTT>Do you think that if Smith is out with a broken leg, that Peterson could lead the Redskins to the playoffs?</UTT>I don't know. They can throw things off for them if they don't have the quaterbacks they used to.</UTT>Redskins are on the edge right now, I'm not sure Peterson will answer. Giants are just horrible this year though.</UTT>Yeah, what do you think of Eli Manning?</UTT>I think it's time for him to retire or turn the ball over to another quarterback.</UTT>Haha, he's ok because he has a geinus level IQ.</UTT>He is far from genius in my book.</UTT>Yeah, I didn't have a word, I just heard what happened.</UTT>Eli made way too many bad decisions with the balls this year, in my opinion. I've watched several of their games this year.</UTT>Yeah, you suppose his dad and brother thinks how he does?</UTT>I'm sure they'll try to help him as much as possible. I heard Payton sitting next to him and going over the game film.</UTT>Makes sense, who do you think is the best Manning clan?</UTT>Payton definitely.</UTT>Hahaha, hope Eli can learn from him.</UTT>Happy Holidays!</UTT>1

Crazy that myspace has a chance to buy facebook for only 75 million dollars.</UTT>Opportunity missed, they are public 10 billion dollars. I wish I could invest back in the day.</UTT>I think we all like that, even for things like Google.</UTT>Google was smart when it bought youtube in 2006.</UTT>Crazy to think the price is $165 million. But the advertising revenue pays them off.</UTT>Nice! All the videos on youtube are cool!</UTT>Except for JustinBiber's baby, which is the most disliked video on youtube. I think it's just beaten out though.</UTT>Gangam style is so popular they have to change how they count videos.</UTT>Many celebrities have their own YouTube channel.</UTT>The police even had their own YouTube called the Blue Tube.</UTT>Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode, making celebrities who are only paid the highest of Lebron James.</UTT>That's a lot. Is Caroline Burnett the first celeb to appear on Sesame Street?</UTT>I don't. Celebrity status is often associated with wealth and fame often provides an opportunity to earn revenue.</UTT>True, Ethiopian celebrities use their celebrity to good effect to try to convince their people to diversify their diet.</UTT>Interesting that people try and do that and get it done.</UTT>Apparently, if they weren't friends with 10 people on facebook, Burger King would give people Whopper.</UTT>That's silly. Ireland re-wrote its constitution on facebook, allowing the public to make suggestions and alter. How social media is used.</UTT>Better than banning similar buttons as they do in parts of Germany.</UTT>I don't even get the point of that.</UTT>I wonder if they block like buttons on YouTube. It's the second largest in the world.</UTT>That's nuts. Account for half of the peak internet traffic in North America is made up of NFC and YouTube together.</UTT>1

Hello.</UTT>The Pittsburgh shooting was a terrible thing.</UTT>I know the details of the article.</UTT>These types of incidents have been rising for the past two years.</UTT>Okay, please tell me the above article details.</UTT>Do you remember hearing about church shootings in Pittsburgh or Charlottesville?</UTT>The deadly violence in Charlottesville has put the alt right and white supremacy at the center of the national politics debate.</UTT>The lie is that the scare-warped mental extremists deeply hate certain groups of people.</UTT>Do you know the second section of the article?</UTT>I only heard a little bit about church vandalism.</UTT>Please tell me the details for me.</UTT>Whether you follow these kinds of things or pay no attention at all, it's pretty obvious that there's still much hate.</UTT>This is a fact.</UTT>Did you participate in the protest in 2017?</UTT>I'm not. Do you think this is the most important thing for everyone?</UTT>I think everyone should stand up against hate.</UTT>Okay, do you know section 3 of the article?</UTT>It was about a young man walking into a church shooting everyone point blank.</UTT>Oh, I think you are very interested in social issues.</UTT>Can you summarize your thoughts on the author's comments in part 4 of the story?</UTT>I'm not fully concerned with this story, but I know a little bit about this story.</UTT>1

What's your interest?</UTT>I enjoy listening to music. I really like Linkin Park and their Hybrid Theory is a top selling album in the 21st century.</UTT>One Direction is my favorite band. I know a few of Linkin Park's songs.</UTT>I like them too. I think it would be interesting to release Pink Fluff's Dark Side of the Moon over 40 years ago, although it was a top seller back in 2014.</UTT>I miss one direction together, that's interesting.</UTT>I hate breaking up a good band. Actually, there is a set of Japanese twins who made a rap album together at the age of 100. I think that's pretty awesome.</UTT>I'm down only to know the name of the music of the Japanese twins to listen to?</UTT>I can't recall, but listening and watching is great, so check it out. I love comedy so it falls into that area. Do you like?</UTT>Can you do some comedy with me?</UTT>Sure, I really enjoyed movies like Pineapple Express and The Hangover, but I just think they're funny overall, do you not like that kind?</UTT>I like that kind.</UTT>Watch the 3rd Rock comedy show? It received the best comedy award in 1997, the Golden Globes. It even beats Friends and Seinfeld.</UTT>I have no. What is that?</UTT>It's just a funny comedy, but it's still pretty old (you should also check out some movies with Ryan Tiles as an actor, he's pretty funny). Do you know who he is?</UTT>It's on Netflix, if it's on Netflix, I'll try to watch it. I don't know him.</UTT>I'm not sure it could happen. You know in Africa people can legally add flame throwers to their cars to stop carjacking. I can't believe it is legal. It's actually kinda funny.</UTT>Attach flamethrower to car?</UTT>And completely legal. I guess they handle their protection a bit more seriously than we in America. I'm glad we have them now instead of buggies with horses.</UTT>That's cool!</UTT>Actually, race car drivers began that profession when they beat over 90000 people in the video game Gran Tourismuso. They are very skilled, i would say out loud.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>1

Hello, how do you do? Like football, Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams was completely painted pink.</UTT>I guess pink means to soften up the opposition. Football games certainly have a lot of interesting history.</UTT>Yeah, I can't imagine it being intimidating lol, back in the 60's.</UTT>Then football didn't develop into much of a sport. I heard that many of the world's biggest stadiums belong to college football teams. It wasn't surprising that some towns didn't do much Saturday.</UTT>Right, college football has a lot of funds too.</UTT>That's true at the high school level too. The stadium in Allen, Texas, costs $6 billion. That's going to be high school.</UTT>Wow Texas loves its football. The football game was scored in 1916 when Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland in the highest ever score.</UTT>I never expected a tech school to be good at football, but Cumberland is probably just a tiny college. These days football coaches are paid insane amounts.</UTT>I know right, former Nfl player Rb Benjarvus Green-ellis never fumbled with football in his career.</UTT>That's what it is!</UTT>That is incredible. You know humans can lose their body hair as long as 250,000 years ago.</UTT>They may not need it because of the fires discovered and clothing created.</UTT>It's probably just an adaptation to the environment.</UTT>No human beings around that long either. If you look at the history of the earth 24 hours in, we're only here 1 minute 17 seconds.</UTT>Wow, humans have adapted to persistent hunting, making them one of the best distance runners of all animals.</UTT>It doesn't sound like it has much capability. It allows us to spread around the globe. We are now out in space.</UTT>Yup, almost all animals and plants synthesize vitamin c, but humans cannot because the genes of these enzymes are defective.</UTT>We depend on other creatures to get the nutrition we need. Do you know that we are the only mammals that can't swallow and breathe at the same time?</UTT>I only feel that I know this from experience. The frequency of sound is what humans fear.</UTT>That's probably the same frequency for a lot of animals. I bet there's something about the movement of the earth.</UTT>Have a good one for great talk.</UTT>1

How are you hi?</UTT>Great, who thinks Trump's tariffs on China will help trader of knock off designer bags?</UTT>That's funny, I think the whole idea is just weird. What a stumping, what a weird thing.</UTT>I don't know of a designer guy, another $2.5 BILLION is around the corner. It hurts the business that has legit designer handbags.</UTT>I'm not, either. It hurts a lot of American businesses too.</UTT>Yep. Beijing promised to crack down on counterfeiters but I don't hold my breath.</UTT>No, doing so would not benefit them. Like reading those pesky service terms when buying something online.</UTT>I've never read that. Only 7% of people read.</UTT>I always just click on accept and hope for the best. I'm 93% of the population. If you're on Mt Everest you can read it on your 3G phone.</UTT>Good to know. I'm 93% too. I love the internet but mostly use it to keep people up, shop and entertain.</UTT>You are on facebook. I tried to give it up this year only when I needed it, and I really didn't miss it.</UTT>I am, but mostly observation/comment.</UTT>I'm almost only looking at people's profiles when I'm there. I have nothing to add and hate brag about the stuff I've done for photos.</UTT>Do you know that most countries don't have the President we call?</UTT>I don't know about that. That's different.</UTT>Okay, if you were president you could go to all those summit meetings with big wigs from other countries. That actually sounds boring.</UTT>No, I actually wear a big wig and have so much fun. The whole thing is doing a glass of wine.</UTT>Cool. You sound like an Indonesian President who released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Ha - is Indonesian music hunger that great?</UTT>That must be a genre. I don't know about it. They could have a big dance party instead of a boring summit meeting and could network it through 3G.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you?</UTT>Good for you. Do you like video games?</UTT>Good for me. Thanks for asking. I like video games back when I started playing with an old Atari 2600 system that I still have in my closet.</UTT>That's so cool, I have an NES sitting under my TV, I love old school games.</UTT>Cool bean. I heard in South Korea that it is illegal for kids under 16 to play video games after midnight. Wow.</UTT>Things are taken a bit extreme there. I agree that it isn't good for them to play up, but it is made illegal.</UTT>Well, I'm probably under jail, because I know I'll be playing a lot after midnight when I'm supposed to be sleeping.</UTT>I even liked sleeping too much then. But I spent many summers saving for the princess.</UTT>Hey, I have a pattern of Pacman memorized, did you watch NFL football?</UTT>I too. That game never ends, it just keeps going. I watch a little football. You?</UTT>But lately it's getting boring. That Super Bowl game has been dragging for seeming three hours.</UTT>Especially considering how little live action is being considered in a given game.</UTT>I read about the actual live game (only 11 minutes) somewhere. I know a lot of wasted time is spent standing around, but come on.</UTT>I know, the game is interesting on the running clock, 15 seconds between plays max. It's like extreme football.</UTT>Or have a female playing that could make the watching more interesting?</UTT>It does. She probably keeps checking their egos too.</UTT>You are probably right. Well, I read the NFL doesn't rule on females. I wonder why at least there aren't any kickers yet.</UTT>I guess it's not a rush because of how they're being for the saint cheerleaders.</UTT>Wow, that's pretty rough to me. Can't eat in a restaurant where the NFL pays, and if the player is eating and walking, the payer has to leave. Wonder what prompted those rules?</UTT>I can't imagine anything you can solve without talking to a grown adult about it.</UTT>I sure bet it's something juicy, nice to chat to you tonight. Have a good night friends.</UTT>1

I wonder why at least there aren't any kickers yet.</UTT>I guess it's not a rush because of how they're being for the saint cheerleaders.</UTT>That's pretty rough, I understand.</UTT>I can't imagine anything you can solve without talking to a grown adult about it.</UTT>I sure bet it's something juicy, nice to chat to you tonight. Have a good night friends.</UTT>0
Hello, this fact probably happened before Trump, but JFK, Washington and Jefferson were the wealthiest.</UTT>Hey, it takes a lot of money to elect. Campaigns are expensive. Do you know that the vice president was not made until 1905? I can imagine all the fighting for that.</UTT>I heard it. Imagine Hillary being Vice President of Trump.</UTT>I know that's crazy, you know the Indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office. Can you imagine our current or former president singing?</UTT>I've also heard it. I hope he doesn't ignore the main things he has to run the country.</UTT>He can combine them. Turn political speech into a pop song. Hehe.</UTT>In another foreign president, Zimbabwe's first president is called Banana.</UTT>I wonder if his name or title is, you know what a head banana is lol You've been to many concerts hey?</UTT>I haven't had time lately in the past. I heard that Linkin Park played 342 concerts in 2001.</UTT>Yeah, I wish I could see that. I don't think they'll tour anymore because Bennington died, sad.</UTT>I know, it's sad, they've had such a success with their debut album.</UTT>Now you want to talk about the long run of the concert. They say the Ramones played 226 concerts over almost 20 years. That's what that is now about.</UTT>Indeed that is dedicated. The ancient Roman amphitheatre in the former Croatia is still used for concerts.</UTT>Wow, I bet it would be awesome to attend a concert in a place like that. I think Pink Fluff once recorded a concert in an old amphitheater.</UTT>I heard it. It appears they had live concerts in ancient places without any audience.</UTT>No audience, huh. I wonder if they'll at least record it. If that doesn't seem to make a little point.</UTT>They can just make a music video or they can enjoy the ambience personally.</UTT>They said a creed concert was so bad that 4 people who went to the concert filed a lawsuit against the band (speaking about the concert) Can you imagine a concert that was so bad you would sue the band?</UTT>I've never heard that before. How bad can it be? I don't like people sue for every small thing.</UTT>I don't know if they could have a technical problem and the audience couldn't hear it very well. Or if one of the band members showed up drunk. I definitely see that reason in a lawsuit.</UTT>You don't have to sue, just complain enough on social media, I've never been a Creed fan, I'd have to run anyway. Nice to chat to you.</UTT>1

Hi, did you watch Bachelor? I can watch it all day long. How great they always have lawyers and drama.</UTT>I've never had. I can see how that entertains, but it kind of kills the idea that it's supposed to be reality.</UTT>You just have to know that. I mean, it's kind of crazy for a 22 year old to try to get to 36.</UTT>Yeah, I admit I assume a little, is that even called reality TV anymore? I don't think anybody actually thinks about it that way, it's just a manipulative drama.</UTT>I completely agree, but honestly I watched the drama. For example, one girl who assumed everyone was jealous, and Arie really didn't like him.</UTT>And they seem to care very much who they let on the show. They want a clashing personality so things like Crystal trashing other girls are natural.</UTT>They also plan dates that bring out drama. Like they make wild dates that bring out all the discomfort of the girls.</UTT>I can see why. I don't want to have to eat worms or drink urine either.</UTT>Clearly, Arie was still planning to give Crystal a rose, although she obviously sought attention. I think they told him who he picked, don't they?</UTT>I'm not at all surprised by that. I'm not surprised to know that things like Crystal calling out to others for being insecure are being coach as well. They know how to get people to watch.</UTT>Very true. I think they also try to engage people through social media. They always have tweeters like jordynhtaylor.</UTT>Oh yeah, definitely. Even more evidence of that is the fact that Kelly Keegs was listed after her in the article.</UTT>Tia and Kennedy are also very similar to wild stuff in the wilderness. It makes for good TV.</UTT>Yeah, they can make most of it as well. If you have to eat worms, why don't you at least try to enjoy it?</UTT>Yuck, I admit I enjoy drama, I'm pretty sad Jim Carrey doesn't do drama anymore, I love him!</UTT>I haven't heard that. It's a shame. He's really good at it.</UTT>Haha, reality TV dramas are very different.</UTT>Oh yeah, sure, I just learned that soap opera is called that because the soap manufacturer sponsors the show. That's funny.</UTT>That's so interesting. I'm actually interested in learning that drama came from ancient Greece so long ago.</UTT>It has a pretty interesting past. The entertainment really goes back a long way.</UTT>I also really enjoy theater dramas. You?</UTT>I did. I haven't been for a while though.</UTT>Also do you know of a website where you can listen to thousands of radio drama episodes for free?</UTT>I don't. I listen to quite a few podcasts, I guess, which I can.</UTT>What is the absolute genre of podcasts?</UTT>Comedy is usually. Interviews or just general talk show about comedians.</UTT>I like them all as well!</UTT>1

Hello, do you know that the sun is actually white?</UTT>Hi, I wasn't aware of that, but I know that the sunset on Mars was blue. I think it was very interesting and beautiful.</UTT>That's interesting.</UTT>I also think it's interesting that the sun doesn't rotate in a solid body, and the equator actually rotates faster than the poles.</UTT>Same, lightning bolts are also pretty crazy, 5 times hotter than the sun's surface.</UTT>Is it really? I certainly wouldn't want it to strike then. You don't know that 99.86 percent of our solar system is made up of sun masses. That's amazing.</UTT>That's amazing, can't believe it's that big.</UTT>I know, right? And the only element discovered on the sun before we did on Earth was a related note.</UTT>Wow, since it was discovered in 1846, Pluto also completed its first orbit around the sun in 2011.</UTT>That is amazing, I can't believe it took that long. Actually, there is a radio station that translates the sun's activity into sound so you can listen to its live music. I hope to hear it someday.</UTT>That was impressive, and I wondered if they actually released the stations on.</UTT>That's a good question. I particularly love listening to radio. Do you know that only President Woodrow Wilson has a doctorate? Hard to believe that is?</UTT>That's hard to believe, you think more of it. I think he has a doctorate in political science.</UTT>I think so as well, but we just haven't had a fluent foreign language since FDR, which is just surprising. I always assume that all presidents can speak different languages.</UTT>I don't know if any of us recently spoke (I think he spoke French and German) - not positive though.</UTT>So you can believe that at his inauguration the first President Lincoln was photographed and ironically also included John Wilkes Booth. Wrong, right?</UTT>damn, Lincoln was photo bombed, and creepy because of his assassination.</UTT>That's creepy, isn't it? If we implemented a similar law to Guatemala that would never allow a former president to run for president with close relatives, how would you feel?</UTT>It doesn't affect me at all. I don't think I'd vote for it, it makes sense to immerse a family member in the political world and there may be great candidates for the same position or that vicinity.</UTT>I agree, to be honest I feel the exact same way. I often wonder if the president has weird rituals like stuffing tootsie rolls into his socks before the game and saying they make him run faster.</UTT>Oh, why does that make him run faster?</UTT>1

Hi, do you like football?</UTT>I watch it all the time. I heard the Carolina Panthers could draft DJ Moore.</UTT>He was excited to leave Maryland.</UTT>I heard Moore was pretty impressed with Norv Turner. Moore is probably a good fit with him.</UTT>I can't believe he had 30 other scouts looking for him.</UTT>Yea Mel Kiper thinks Moore is going to Jacksonville at number 29.</UTT>I think it's crazy that average NFL game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>I can see only 11 minutes of games in the NFL and the time it takes players to get ready between games.</UTT>I also don't know if the NFL has no written rules against female players.</UTT>It would be interesting to see if every female player who kicks a place is female, as they can play according to rules.</UTT>That's interesting, do you know engineers have higher average earnings?</UTT>I can see engineers making more lifetimes than Nfl players, because they have a longer career and are less injured.</UTT>I wonder how many average years the NFL players have stayed in the league.</UTT>Bill Beckinck has been coaching for so long that he was the last coach to win a playoff game for the Browns.</UTT>That's a long time. I wonder how much he's net worth.</UTT>I don't know, but after winning 21 postseason games under his coach, belichick has to have a lot of money.</UTT>Funny how if the Super Bowl is lost the Buffalo Bill equals the Patriots.</UTT>I find it funny that Tom Brady's junior football team never started him, even though they didn't win the game.</UTT>I wonder how he's improved so much.</UTT>I don't know, but he's pretty smart and probably not as smart as Alex Smith, who received his bachelor's after 2 years.</UTT>Wow, that's impressive. I wonder if he did it so fast so he could go pro?</UTT>Well, I went and chatted with you nicely.</UTT>1

You're a football fan. I just moved to the Boston area 4 years ago, so I kind of suck on that. Funny comparison between the Patriots and the Lannies by the author of Game of Two.</UTT>I'm a Vikings fan, the Patriots are a great team, but I can see them as being great. lol</UTT>I agree that my wife loves that show. I am average about it. I actually lived in KC for 49 years and had season tickets in Arrowhead so my team was mys. Bill Bellichick won the playoff game in 1995 as a coach for the Kansas City Chiefs.</UTT>Wow, he's just the coach that won the playoffs. I think he's the most successful coach in playoff history.</UTT>I think you are correct. He is worshipped around here. I'm a fan of fran tracington but he's dating me. Gisele Bundchen doubles her husband's salary by earning a model and there are no ramen noodles in Brady's household.</UTT>That can date you, but you have all this experience and knowledge. If my wife makes that much, I wouldn't work. lol</UTT>I agree that Bradley would never eat strawberries in his lifetime if he had a crazy diet supposedly to keep young and in shape. With his performance over the past 40 years, there might be something in that.</UTT>I wonder if he's allergic or something, strawberry is awesome, I hear he's vegan.</UTT>Ironically, he did something right, even though he was put on the injury report every week by Belichick. Why do you think he did that?</UTT>I think that's so interesting, I've never known that. I bet the psychology team has to work to play Bay and potential backups. What do you think?</UTT>I agree, or they never know if he was really injured. You've actually read that average NFL game only has live 11 minute gameplay. That could be better for the body and strenuousness of the player than the commercials during a break.</UTT>I guess the game is a lot higher sure, it lasts 3 hours, but that's a good enough number to be safe for the players.</UTT>You know that average engineers make more than average NFL/MLB players in their lifetime. I guess all those players with shorter careers from big money players will bring the average down. I hope they get a good pension.</UTT>Only a select few get that big paycheck. I bet this is an engineer who makes the same tracker chip on a shoulder pad.</UTT>I read that. I can see why they track the bowl, but you think they track the players equipment. Women playing in the league is not a rule, there seem to be some great soccer players and you think there's ever been a female kicker.</UTT>I think female kickers are made, I just read the article the other day and it may be earlier than later, I feel.</UTT>You see, the Saints are not allowed to have their cheerleaders dine in the same restaurant as the players. If they eat when the players enter, they must immediately leave the restaurant. It seems sexist and makes me sue under the law.</UTT>That is such sexism that I wonder what other teams think or even if they know it. Someone should speak up.</UTT>When my inlaws were from NY and you see Bills v. Patriots (Ying and Yang) I was surprised that someone didn't address that or a crafty lawyer would.</UTT>That's sad they got to second place like many years I think. Kind of embarrassing but also pretty cool that they made it that far all the time. So nice to chat with you, go Brady.</UTT>My Chiefs won last year under Richard Nixon as president but we know the disappointments too, Patrick Mahomes breathes back the franchise's hope. This year we went to the first game at Gillette in Foxborough when the Chiefs played the Patriots, an amazing game.</UTT>Yikes, I think your chief will win it in 3 years. I call it, have a great weekend.</UTT>1

Hi, do you know that the guest house is bigger than the white house?</UTT>That's really wild, I wonder why that's happening. You know the Zimbabwean president is named Banana haha.</UTT>That is a very unique name.</UTT>I've seen the Indonesian president release 3 pop albums. Do you think President Banan will also do this?</UTT>That's pretty awesome, I wonder how many concerts he's done, I have no clue what President Banana is doing about this lol</UTT>LOL I've never heard of him before either. You think we should go back to the old world where the president became vice president and runner up.</UTT>LOL, I didn't think Trump and Hillary would be a good team until they were out.</UTT>Nope at all, that's a recipe for massive drama btw. Do you listen to the radio? I do sometimes listen to it on my way to work.</UTT>Sometimes yes, but I usually listen to audio books or pandora.</UTT>I usually listen to youtube. I hear you can listen to Sturm from Jupiter. I think it's on Am Radio. I need to try to listen.</UTT>That sounds really interesting. You can listen to old classic radio dramas for free.</UTT>Wow, have you listened to it? I'd probably like it. But you said you got what you paid for haha.</UTT>I probably wouldn't listen to it to be honest. I've heard soldiers used to make radios out of razor blades and pencils. That's so weird.</UTT>That's crazy, it's called "The Foxhole Radio" and I have no idea how it works. Also, I don't listen to radio stations broadcast in classical Latin (hahahaha).</UTT>I don't speak Latin, but it's interesting either.</UTT>What do you think of the government? I guess they are trying to destroy Wikileaks or something.</UTT>That's interesting. I heard the 86 percent of Nevada is owned by the government.</UTT>I heard that too. I also heard that the guy was trying to sell the Eiffel Tower. That's insane haha.</UTT>LOL, so that guy is an amusing con artist.</UTT>Oh total, Norway gave over 1 billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest, that's super nice of them!</UTT>That's really nice of them. I'd really like to visit Norway one day.</UTT>I do too, the whole country seems filled with super nice people haha. I can see you there.</UTT>1

That's insane haha.</UTT>LOL, so that guy is an amusing con artist.</UTT>Oh total, Norway gave over 1 billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest, that's super nice of them!</UTT>That's really nice of them. I'd really like to visit Norway one day.</UTT>I do too, the whole country seems to be full of super nice people haha, I can see you there, wow, you probably listened to him she, but you listened to you lose your pay?</UTT>0
Hello, do you like dancing?</UTT>I love dancing, what about you?</UTT>I wasn't very good at it. Do you know Bruce Lee is also a great dancer?</UTT>I don't know that, is he, or is he a martial artist, or is he the same guy?</UTT>He's a martial artist, a very famous guy.</UTT>As I see, he's never won a dance contest as well?</UTT>I saw him do back in 1958. You know that a professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes a week.</UTT>That's a lot of shoes, they only have to spend a fortune on them, you know parrots can also dance, how cool is that?</UTT>I agree, I don't know that about parrots, that's pretty hilarious.</UTT>They can dance to music perfectly and the fun fact is that they can mimic it and also speak to it.</UTT>Very cool Michael Jackson has one of his dance moves patented for using objects to let him lean very far to the side.</UTT>MJ is a great dancer and there are funny facts about him, but he didn't create the moonwalk.</UTT>I don't know that about moonwalks. Do you know who it was created from?</UTT>Bill Bailey perfomed it in 1955 for the first time. This fact comes as well as surprise to me.</UTT>Very surprised. Do you know that when babies hear music they instinctively dance?</UTT>I haven't heard that. I guess if the parrot did, it wouldn't surprise the baby to do too.</UTT>Yes, do you like radio?</UTT>I do. I listen to it every day. Do you like it?</UTT>I love radio and also listen to it every day.</UTT>Amazing how radiostations translate solar activity into sound. How could that even happen?</UTT>I agree, really good to chat with you.</UTT>1

They can stand the music, which is flawed, and the fun fact is that they can mimic it and also read it.</UTT>I love radio and also listen to it every day.</UTT>Amazing how radiostations translate solar activity into sound. How could that even happen?</UTT>I agree.</UTT>0
Have you ever tried to snack on dragon breath?</UTT>You haven't. That's crazy.</UTT>I'm not, but I've heard they can really be dangerous, teen and their crazy snacks.</UTT>It's dangerous. Mayonnaise ice-cream sounds horrible.</UTT>It sounds horrible because both are extremely unhealthy and combined create a disgusting time bomb.</UTT>LOL. Did you watch U-Tube?</UTT>I love youtube because I use it daily?</UTT>I do. I watch it a lot. It gets everything. The guy talks about the elephant in the first video uploaded.</UTT>Now that must be one of the most famous elephants. It's amazing on youtube they made up half the peak internet traffic in the country. LOL</UTT>I believe that because it began as a date website.</UTT>It does. I don't know about that, remember the Gangnam style?</UTT>No, what's that? Have you watched any of those full 70 episodes of "Joy of Painting"?</UTT>It's a video that was viewed on youtube for record. It's really funny that you should look it up. You have to update the integer count because that video.</UTT>I'm willing. You like dancing. A parrot dances perfectly in time with music.</UTT>I don't like dancing, I have two left feet. However, Tupac is a skilled dancer.</UTT>He is. Bill Bailey is the first to do a moonwalk.</UTT>I think MJ is the first moonwalker. When did Bill Bailey do that?</UTT>LOL, in 1955, there was no picture of Mr. Rogers doing a breakdance.</UTT>That's a hard scene to picture. A baby can spontaneously dance when she hears music and smile at the beat. lol</UTT>Aww, I love that. Now the funky chicken and robot dance is back.</UTT>I hope it stays there back. Ballet dancers sure spend a lot of money on shoes.</UTT>Yes, lol. Are you a Drake fan?</UTT>I'm a fan of Drake, he has some songs I like and Hotline Bling is one of my favorites.</UTT>1

Now the funky chicken and robot dance is back.</UTT>I have to admit, it could have been back. Ballet dancers sure laugh at the shoes for a lot of money.</UTT>Yes, I'm snacking loud, are you a Drake fan?</UTT>I'm a Drake fan and Hotline Bling is one of my favorites.</UTT>0
Hi, do you like dancing?</UTT>I like to watch it. I know a great dancer named Bruce Lee and he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship in 1958.</UTT>I can't say I'm surprised. He must have a great sense of rhythm. I bet he's really a lady man.</UTT>Yeah, I bet. You know ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.</UTT>I would have gone through a dozen if I were a dancer lol. I really can't dance.</UTT>I'm too. Do you know Michael Jackson had a patent?</UTT>Is that a patent for a special leaning shoe? He's a real genius.</UTT>ii) It is a device used to achieve extreme leaning in some of his dance moves.</UTT>That's it, I've never been any good at dancing, I'm wondering if you have to start when you're young?</UTT>I know that when a baby hears music he spontaneously dances. Better dancers can hear a lot of music when they are young.</UTT>I wonder if I've heard enough music. Maybe it's me and maybe I'm missing in the window. Oh well.</UTT>Yeah, maybe. I know they'll smile more when they hit the bet.</UTT>I used to smile when I hit a bet too. Back in high school I heard Tupac was a dancer (lol!</UTT>Yeah, I thought he was dancing in a Nutcracker production in high school.</UTT>I bet he's really good too. He later danced the digital underground as a backup. By the way, snake fans?</UTT>No, I'm not crazy about snakes, no snakes in New Zealand.</UTT>So I heard. I guess if I had a snake phobia I would have moved there. I've never seen a flying snake, that's frightening.</UTT>They are basically lizards without legs and no limbs.</UTT>Oh okay, I guess snake fear is hard wired into human brains, we need to evolve.</UTT>Yeah, you can believe that crocodiles are closer in relation to birds than snakes.</UTT>I guess scales and feathers are analogous, I never knew they were related, great chat anyway.</UTT>Yeah, it's good to talk to you too.</UTT>1

Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>I commute to work and back most days.</UTT>Interesting that I had to ride the subway to be able to listen to it. I missed it though. Do you know that you can make radio with razors and pencils?</UTT>Oh, that's neat. I've heard the Hannon song become the most requested track on a Chicago alternative rock station because the DJ didn't reveal the name of the band. Kinda roped some talented brothers into a teeny bopper band and they didn't shake that image.</UTT>You know about Hamilton from Canada, I don't.</UTT>Oh cool, I think all the artists of Canada are good artists, but you know the most popular radio act of the 1930s was ventriloquist. I don't even know how.</UTT>I'm interested in that, I wonder why people like that.</UTT>Who knows when it will be simpler back then. It may be easier. LOL</UTT>Yeah, do you know of a website where you can listen to thousands of classic radio episodes?</UTT>I don't know about that, I must check it out. I know of a radio station that translates solar activity into sound so you can listen to their music live. How cool is that?</UTT>It's pretty cool, do you know if it's a minute or a minute radio?</UTT>iii) It's an Am station out of Topeka, Kansas. Have you ever visited 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. on a different note?</UTT>I have and actually live in that area. Pretty cool stuff.</UTT>That's nice. Do you know the very first phone number of the White House?</UTT>I don't. That's crazy and I wonder how many prank calls they get.</UTT>There are probably plenty. I have heard of a replica of the Atlanta White House built as a private home. Have you ever visited it?</UTT>No, but I visited the real one. It wasn't nearly as big as you thought.</UTT>I heard that. I heard most of it was below ground. Do you know that Jimmy Carter installed the solar panels that Ronald Reagan promptly removed when he took office?</UTT>Interesting, then George W put them back.</UTT>I guess Jimmy Carter also had all the thermostats turned down to 65 degrees Celsius in the winter of 1977. I was a little girl back then, but it was very cold.</UTT>Interesting, well, nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Do you think Trump should buddy up with Kim Jong-un?</UTT>No, I don't think he's trustworthy. Kim Jong Un started editing pictures to depict different histories, like Mao and previous communist leaders Stalin did.</UTT>He has degrees in Physics and Military Studies.</UTT>That's interesting. I read no one knew he was old. Bizarre.</UTT>I think his order to kill his family members is as cold as you can get.</UTT>Yes, Trump decided to meet him, the first meeting between the US president and North Korean leader.</UTT>I don't think Kim has any respect whatsoever for him. He and his half brother and uncle were killed too, so I doubt Kim has any admiration for Trump.</UTT>I'm sure there are many ulterior motives, I'm not aware that the first North Korean leader was born after the country was founded.</UTT>Yep, and he is the first one to allow his country to participate in the Olympics too, but agree with the South.</UTT>iii) Interesting: He met with Trump to discuss the North Korean nuclear program.</UTT>I don't think he's giving up his nuclear program. I think he's using it as a leverage to negotiate to get what he wants.</UTT>I didn't realize he was called The Marshall.</UTT>They are all made up names.</UTT>He was voted the sexiest man alive by satirical group The Onion. Haha.</UTT>I think they trotted him.</UTT>There have been many famous international heads of state meetings called summits since 1955.</UTT>Another summit with Kim is scheduled for early next year with Trump.</UTT>Oh boy, Spain is the only country that is a permanent guest at every G20 summit!</UTT>LOL, maybe they should think Kim, Trump and Putin aren't invited.</UTT>That's interesting. At the G20 summit in Brisbane, Moscow said it was a guess that Canada's prime minister would shake hands but only one thing he said to you. You need to get out of UKraine.</UTT>Watching Putin give that handshake to MBS at the last summit is uncomfortable.</UTT>Thankfully I didn't watch, chatted to you nicely, take care.</UTT>1

You are a football fan. Variations include Gaelic, Australian, gridiron and soccer.</UTT>Hi, I sometimes follow football, I usually watch the Super Bowl. Who are you?</UTT>I love soccer. It makes the biggest money in football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey.</UTT>The world loves soccer. Everyone can play soccer, from men to women to big and small to rich and poor. It is the most democratic sport.</UTT>Jon Stewart played soccer in college. He didn't strike me as an athlete.</UTT>He doesn't do it now, but he's pretty thin. He has a former soccer player built up. lol I used to play but now I don't look at it.</UTT>Have you ever played 3 team soccer? Sounds like a challenge.</UTT>What is that even? How does that work? Why does it exist? I have a question.</UTT>I have a question too. It seems odd. I still assume it is in a rectangular field with a goalie.</UTT>I guess how many goals, one for each team, why this game is needed, who plays it, and what is their video version out there?</UTT>I assume the material written on it. Reading is a great option for decoding symbols to gain meaning.</UTT>I try to read as much as possible. I enjoy reading and find ways to enjoy as I pass the time. You?</UTT>I enjoy reading so much that I have to speed it up to get it all done. 4700 words per minute is the world record. I'm not nearly that fast.</UTT>Does it help much? I figure at that speed it won't retain much of what I read. I guess there's a good way to familiarize myself with the material.</UTT>It's tough to comprehend well, I'm not a fan of poetry, CS Tolkien doesn't seem to be either, he's holding a competition with poetry you laugh at and lose.</UTT>Tolkien and Lewis were great authors and a great appreciation of the language. I bought a ticket to see that contest.</UTT>Moral panic spread in the 18th century because so many people read the novel.</UTT>See novel as devil's word. Poetry is seen as a source of higher thought and sublime morality.</UTT>I would like to learn how to read braille. What an amazing option for those who can't see.</UTT>When the guy who invented it came up with it, he was quite young. I wonder how it works for Chinese readers. Anyway, great chat.</UTT>Nice to meet you, bye</UTT>Have a good night.</UTT>Bye.</UTT>1

Hi, look forward to chatting with you.</UTT>Hello, are you a Facebook user?</UTT>I've been addicted since I created an account. Are you?</UTT>I have an account since 2005.</UTT>I guess there is a cool way to stay in touch with friends and family.</UTT>It's a very useful tool for that. Do you know that all the divorces in the U.S. in 2011 were filled in one place, Facebook?</UTT>What does having a facebook word mean? It's somehow responsible.</UTT>I'm really not sure. I know that Facebook has changed the world a lot.</UTT>It is expanding. We are now getting a marketplace on facebook so it will compete with ebay and Craigslist and I hear that the date will be added soon.</UTT>That's interesting. I wonder what adding date would be like.</UTT>You know the same as all others, but you are integrated into a Facebook profile so people see your history and already know a lot about you (it helps to make a better choice of dates).</UTT>That's true, I guess 30% of all Americans use it as a primary news source as well.</UTT>If you ask me, it can also be used as a dangerous news tool right there.</UTT>I heard you there, I guess it has 56 customary gender options as well.</UTT>LOL That's too little to remember.</UTT>I'm with you and I don't know how to track so many people.</UTT>LOL, who knows?</UTT>LOL I heard you. I know Facebook has a ton of money value.</UTT>Yeah, it's a money making machine and it doesn't seem to stop any time soon.</UTT>Oh no, the value of it has dropped hugely this summer, but it will come back in my opinion.</UTT>probably because of the scandal when people find out they are storing our private data and conversations.</UTT>That and some other major factors. Nice to talk to you today.</UTT>1

Hello, did you watch Iron Man?</UTT>I have. It's great.</UTT>I agree, I watched it recently again, which was very funny too. I love the part where he experimented with the first suit he made and a lot went wrong.</UTT>LOL Robert Downer Jr. was awesome to choose to play Iron Man.</UTT>I read somewhere that the Iron Man suit was roughly 450 pieces. You're right, crazy.</UTT>That's insane, I wonder how many pieces were put on.</UTT>I have no clue, you know loudly that JARVIS stands for just a rather very intelligent system?</UTT>I don't think I'd do it. That makes sense despite the technology in the movie and the exoskeleton suit.</UTT>*Lol* Paul Betty, the actor who plays Jarvis, never even saw the movie Iron Man. They paid him so much money to do it and he didn't even care to see it.</UTT>Wow, that intersets.</UTT>The director chose to film in California because most of the super heroes were on the east coast.</UTT>Hmmm why is that? Director Jon Favreau?</UTT>Right, I read he did that because most super heroes are on the east coast.</UTT>That was the choice of the director, but that was a team of writers (Mark Fergus, Haw Ostby, Art Marcus and Matt Halloway) I believe they are a writing team.</UTT>I read that Jon Favreau chose it. This film has been developing for a long time, 13 years or something.</UTT>LOL, that's insane, holy cow. And if I remember right, I don't remember the year the other one came out in 2008. I wonder how long that development took.</UTT>I think this is the first time that this movie will be released after "Iron Man". I read somewhere that Tom Cruise and Nicholas cage are also considered "Iron Man".</UTT>yuck i laughed loud i thought that move was horrible i just can't picture that with a laugh.</UTT>Right, totally different. LOL</UTT>LOL I didn't even see it. That went on ruining the Avengers movie.</UTT>If Iron Man tanks in the box office they probably won't make a spin off hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha</UTT>1
Hello, did you watch Iron Man?</UTT>I have. It's great.</UTT>I agree, I watched it recently again, which was very funny too. I love the part where he experimented with the first suit he made and a lot went wrong.</UTT>LOL Robert Downer Jr. was awesome to choose to play Iron Man.</UTT>I read somewhere that the Iron Man suit was roughly 450 pieces. You're right, crazy.</UTT>That's insane, I wonder how many pieces were put on.</UTT>I have no clue, you know loudly that JARVIS stands for just a rather very intelligent system?</UTT>I don't think I would, that makes sense despite the technology in the movie and the exoskeleton suit. I have no. It was great.</UTT>*Lol* Paul Betty, the actor who plays Jarvis, never even saw the movie Iron Man. They paid him so much money to do it and he didn't even care to see it.</UTT>Wow, that intersets.</UTT>The director chose to film in California because most of the super heroes were on the east coast.</UTT>Hmmm why is that? Director Jon Favreau?</UTT>Right, I read he did that because most super heroes are on the east coast.</UTT>That was the choice of the director, but that was a team of writers (Mark Fergus, Haw Ostby, Art Marcus and Matt Halloway) I believe they are a writing team.</UTT>I read that Jon Favreau chose it. This film has been developing for a long time, 13 years or something.</UTT>LOL, that's insane, holy cow. And if I remember right, I don't remember the year the other one came out in 2008. I wonder how long that development took.</UTT>I think this is the first time that this movie will be released after "Iron Man". I read somewhere that Tom Cruise and Nicholas cage are also considered "Iron Man".</UTT>yuck i laughed loud i thought that move was horrible i just can't picture that with a laugh.</UTT>Right, totally different. LOL</UTT>LOL I didn't even see it.

Hi, what do you know about Minecraft?</UTT>Well, I heard it was the 3rd most sold game of all time.</UTT>Minecraft worlds are supposed to be bigger than Neptune.</UTT>That is incredible, isn't that a memory hog?</UTT>It might be. I know a lot of young kids are very into the game.</UTT>It seems to have a lot of options, exploration, gathering resources, crafting, compat.</UTT>They get to build a lot and have their own world. Very creative.</UTT>It's also three dimensions, I wonder if the music is.</UTT>I'm not sure, I've never played with me.</UTT>I heard something about the music festival Coachella, which actually had 2600 people attending.</UTT>I heard of the festival but never did.</UTT>I don't know if it's a physical place or a place in a game in Microsoft. I guess I have to read some to find out. Enjoy the reading?</UTT>I do. It is my favorite way to pass the time. I'm really into non-fiction.</UTT>They say the only person who is capable of reading silently in middle age is the best reader.</UTT>That's really neat, I've never thought of.</UTT>So if we lived 500 years ago, we would be really good readers.</UTT>True, have you read the Enders game?</UTT>No, what can you tell me about it?</UTT>It's on the military read list. It's about boys fighting alien races in a game they think is fun, but it turns out to be a real war.</UTT>That's interesting set up. Do you know that Louis Braille invented his own blind reading and writing system only at the age of 15.</UTT>Wow, that's awesome, well I have to go, nice chat.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you?</UTT>Great, do you know that dogs aren't color blind? Lots of people think so?</UTT>I think they too. Dogs can have 12 different types of blood.</UTT>Wow, that's a lot of different blood types. Do you know Google prefers dogs over cats? I guess it's in their code of conduct.</UTT>That's the company I could work for. AOL is probably a cat company.</UTT>Ha, that's funny. Do you know that Zimbabwe's first president is called Banan?</UTT>That's a weird nickname, I wonder if he got that in college.</UTT>So, you know that pandas research wear pandas costumes for work?</UTT>That's weird Istanbul has a dog vending machine, that's so kind.</UTT>What's that crazy? Wonder how long they'd stay there if no one bought them? You know the guest house of the U.S. president is bigger than the White House.</UTT>That must have infuriated Trump. He doesn't seem to be the type who would tolerate that.</UTT>No kidding, the Indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office. That's something that Trump isn't doing now.</UTT>The losing presidential candidate became vice president until 1805. You can imagine Hilary and Trump working together.</UTT>I tend to think that's a good thing. That forces them to work together and they can't make the campaign so cut-throat.</UTT>It will probably bring some civility back on the campaign trail. I don't look forward to 2020. It will be a train wreck.</UTT>Not kidding, unfortunately there is no viable candidate. You know that the dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to understand the point instinctively.</UTT>I don't. I can understand that the dog knows it, but the elephant can. That's amazing.</UTT>And I think elephants in zoos are completely trained all this time. Do you know what Pizzagate is?</UTT>I do. A far-fetched conspiracy theory. I wonder why Liz Crokin thinks it is true.</UTT>A illogical conspiracy theory.</UTT>Yup, have a nice chat.</UTT>1

Hey, you have Netflix by the way?</UTT>Hello, who are you? I have Netflix, what about you?</UTT>I'm good, I like Netflix, I like strange things a lot, I can't believe it started way back in 1997.</UTT>I love Netflix too.</UTT>Crazy that it takes up all of the Internet traffic, about 33%.</UTT>That's crazy, do you know that NFC spend 20 times as much postage than bandwidth?</UTT>That's wild, I see why they want to switch to all digital. Also crazy that Netflix and YouTube together make up all the internet traffic. I watch them all the time.</UTT>That's also crazy. I didn't realize that Reed Hastings was an inspiration to start Nine after racking up up to $40 late fees on Apollo 13.</UTT>That's a wild thing, but a good movie. It's sad that Blockbuster didn't buy them when they had a chance.</UTT>I agree, the NFL is now worth 2 billion dollars.</UTT>Yup, they offered Blockbuster 50 million dollars, which means value has appreciated quite a lot.</UTT>That's a very big jump in appreciation. LOL, you know people fantasylly draft national spelling bees.</UTT>Oh, I do, they also do fantasy congresses, people seem to do everything fantasy these days. Hahaha.</UTT>LOL, that's hilarious. I only do fantasy football. What about you?</UTT>I only do fantasy football as well, have you read any of Terry Pratchett's books btw? He wrote a fantasy novel.</UTT>I haven't read any of his books, I wonder if they are any good?</UTT>I don't know, I just know he was knighted for his service in literature so I hope they are really good.</UTT>Interesting. Do you know that a single fold in the brain makes reality different from fantasy?</UTT>I didn't. Ever check out the Chicago janitor's fantasy novel. I guess it's like 15,000 pages haha.</UTT>Hahaha I think I'd have to pass that on to myself. Way too long for me.</UTT>yup, it can be amazing, but it can also be long and that horrible.</UTT>Good to talk to you.</UTT>1

Do you know much about politics?</UTT>Fair amount. I'm a freelance writer and mainly write on political topics. Suggestions.</UTT>Nice. I know some stuff like the president has been a Republican or a Democrat since 1883.</UTT>Yeah, after their collapse, the Republican Party replaced the VW Party.</UTT>Yeah, you know that Reagan actually campaigned for the Dems and rallied for high profits for corporations?</UTT>lol, I would definitely like some background context for that.</UTT>I guess he's really against that and also in favor of low wages too.</UTT>I guess that, but I'm curious to nail down exactly when he's complaining about corporations profiting.</UTT>I fear I won't have all the details there. Do you know when both parties will start using red and blue?</UTT>I remember all the election map drama in 2000, the blue states and blue states caught on and journalists were stuck with that assignment from then on. Before that I thought they would use red/blue but they switched to assignation every 4 years.</UTT>Yeah, it's always fun when the elections come around. Do you listen to the radio at all on another topic?</UTT>Because the radio stopped working in my truck and I live in a place where the radio zone is dead other than one of the Top 40 stations. I listen to a lot of music on youtube. Suggestions:</UTT>Oh then that's nice. I listen to the radio. You can apparently catch the Jupiter storm on AM radio.</UTT>I wonder how they sound. I should see if there is an online recording.</UTT>It may exist. Do you know how soldiers made foxhole radios during WWII?</UTT>Until now, that sounds very creative, like a MacGuyver trick.</UTT>It's creative, they use razorblades and pencils to make themselves.</UTT>Ever try to make a crystal radio? I got a kit for Christmas as a kid but I couldn't put it together to work.</UTT>I haven't, but it sounds fun. Have you ever listened to radio drama?</UTT>My brother-in-law is a radio nostalgia fan and i listen to some old records from his collection. I really like comedy like Lum and Abner. Have you ever heard of them?</UTT>I don't have time to check them out, but maybe I'll. It's so nice to chat to you.</UTT>1

Watch Fox News? I don't know if Sean Hannity owns it.</UTT>Usually not. I get my news on the internet.</UTT>I too like skimm a lot, especially since it gives links to longer articles on topics of interest to me. Fox News is now very supportive of conservative activism.</UTT>I heard the same companies own IGN and Fox News. That's cool.</UTT>Yeah, IGN is a gaming website, isn't that interesting and I guess Fox News works because it's watched more than MSNBC and CNN combined?</UTT>Wow, that's impressive. Fox News has threatened to sue Simpson before.</UTT>That's so interesting, especially considering The Simpsons is on Fox.</UTT>I know right, and I'd probably make a lot of money off of them. I guess they don't like it when they're having fun.</UTT>I guess if you can't take the heat you'll get out of the kitchen. You know they actually discussed the possibility of creating an exclusive Simpsons channel.</UTT>That's amazing, but now that we have streaming, it may not be profitable. Maybe they should just allow streaming on their website.</UTT>Yeah, I agree, I hate that they only show a few recent episodes on major channels and you can't stream all of them. I wonder how often they make fun of the President on Simpsons.</UTT>Hahaha, there must be someone out there counting.</UTT>Yeah definitely. There are so many fun random facts about the President's position. You know everyone calls the first Zimbabwean president President Banana.</UTT>Despite his last name being "that", they are not like to make fun of him.</UTT>I have no idea. Still pretty interesting. You know that the vice president was always runner up until 1805?</UTT>LOL, that probably doesn't fly now. I can't imagine them agreeing on anything.</UTT>Yeah, it's an atrocious combination of Clinton and Trump. I wonder how that used to work out. I find it interesting that not one of the richest three people in history is a US president.</UTT>He's sure he's the first number and far wealthier than any of our presidents.</UTT>I don't know if he is. I'm pretty sure JFK, Washington and Jefferson. But who guesses who knows?</UTT>Yeah he was. I've looked it up a few times before. I believe then Trump, Washington and Jefferson, google. I can't imagine it changing in a few months, lol.</UTT>Yeah, I'm not sure. My source of information must have been mistaken.</UTT>Maybe, I'll talk to you great anyway.</UTT>1

Hello, what do you think of Amazon? You may believe it's been around since 1994.</UTT>I love it. Crazy that it started in a book store and developed into what it is today. Jeff Bezos certainly has a great vision.</UTT>That is true, I wonder why he built the clock on a mountain, but that's not the case, the clock should run for 10,000 next year.</UTT>I think you neatly accomplished something you created to exist long past your time, namely, that it ran long.</UTT>I never thought of it like that. You're right, his employees apparently take care of themselves too. Warehouse workers get good exercise every day. They work 7-15 miles on their shifts.</UTT>That's a crazy amount, so that warehouse is sure a lot bigger than selling the first item. The first item sold for $27.95 and customers got the building they were naming.</UTT>I wonder if he bought the book. I heard Amazon started an online bookstore.</UTT>They do. They used to offer so many books then buy and ship to customers. Then they started keeping popular books in stock.</UTT>I like them to keep growing though. I mean they started selling books and now they have a division where they publish them.</UTT>They've even owned IDB since 1998. It's pretty crazy that a simple bookstore has grown into a place where you can find anything.</UTT>What a true story. They are now helping people out of their homes with Echo. They basically cause people to contact them daily.</UTT>And with that device they can help people control their lives, like playing music and even wiring up the house.</UTT>You can use Amazon to help with your life and then use it for entertainment. After all, they now have their own film and television studios.</UTT>I've read books detailing the development of Amazon and aspects of Bezos's life. I believe it is called Everything Store. Even one rare book is facinate so when people want to order that one and nine unprinted books.</UTT>I really would like to read both books. I wonder if Amazon started out as a book store because reading requires creativity and critical analysis. Both seem essential to form a great business.</UTT>I agree. There are even books that have been read about military lists (the Enders game).</UTT>I heard that. Fantastic Enders game movie. I've never read a book though. The more I think I might, the more I think I should.</UTT>I saw the movie, read the book, it was good.</UTT>Did the movie do justice to the book?</UTT>Yes.</UTT>I'll have to read it soon. Another Starship Trooper on the military's mandatory reading list.</UTT>1

Hello, do you know Stephen Curry?</UTT>Now the guy is a legend in the NBA. Do you know why he signed under armor?</UTT>I actually don't know that. Do you know his first name?</UTT>Well, it was caused by a glitch that Nike kept on the PPP, Kevin Durant.</UTT>I see that was a big mistake by them. He was born in the same place as LeBron.</UTT>Nice, there might be something that makes a great player.</UTT>That's possible in Ohio. Do you know Reggie Miller?</UTT>Hmm, I'm actually not sure. I know Tim Duncan will stay in school and then go to the NBA.</UTT>He's good, I guess he managed to do both well. Great player Reggie, but always in the shadow of her sister.</UTT>Wow, that has to be rough. Pretty sad that most NBA players file for bankruptcy after retirement.</UTT>That's for sure, women are going on to break the national record 8 times. I guess that family runs talent.</UTT>Nice one, the coach was just fine saying that no games should be played during Christmas.</UTT>Hmmmm, they really have to fine him though. But Iverson seems to have done pretty well with the contract he signed with Rebook.</UTT>He didn't know he was going to sign with Rebook, so there must be a nice contract there.</UTT>Sure they would pay him $800k a year until he was 55 and then $350,000 in lump sums.</UTT>Wow, then the guy was good for life. Ever followed the Golden State Warriors game?</UTT>I know they play home games in cow palaces because their arenas were booked for other stuff in 1975.</UTT>Wow, cool. Only Curry, the star of the team, made the 4th highest salary.</UTT>Interesting, but he's a star.</UTT>That's very nice of him. GSW is looking to move to San Francisco for the season in 2019.</UTT>Wow, I wonder why, but they earned $12 million losing 4 games in the NBA last season.</UTT>Wow, they still make money whether they win or lose.</UTT>1

But Iverson seems to have done pretty well with the contract he signed with Rebook.</UTT>He didn't know he was going to sign with Rebook, so there must be a nice contract there.</UTT>Sure they'll pay him $800k a month until he's 55 and then $350,000 in lump sums.</UTT>Wow, then the guy was good for life. Ever followed the Golden State Warriors game?</UTT>I know they play home games in cow palaces because their arenas were booked for other stuff in 1975.</UTT>Wow, cool.</UTT>Interesting, but he's a star.</UTT>That's very nice of him. GSW is looking to move to San Francisco for the season in 2019.</UTT>Wow, I wonder why, but they earned $12 million losing 4 games in the NBA last season.</UTT>Wow, they still make money if they win or lose. That was a very summer for him. The GSW are listening to them moving to San Francisco for the season in 2019.</UTT>0
Do you know that Facebook like buttons are illegal in parts of Germany?</UTT>What? Really?</UTT>I know. It is surprising but true. The German state Schleswig-Holstein deems similar buttons illegal.</UTT>What is Zimmerburg suffering from?</UTT>Well, I don't know, but I think he suffers some sort of color blindness.</UTT>He suffers from colorblindness, Red-grenn.</UTT>I guess that explained why Facebook was blue then. I always assume it's just a color in someone's favor.</UTT>Yah I thought the same.</UTT>What do you think of Google? You know, the search engine is pretty powerful. One search requires more compute power than it takes to get to the moon back in the day.</UTT>iii It is a really big and powerful system in the world.</UTT>It is true, then again, it can be kind of simple. Recently, seeing how fast Android phones are moving on the road, I've always wondered how Google maps knows traffic, and I've learned how to do it.</UTT>When Google went down 40%.</UTT>What about Google going down 40%?</UTT>Google went down for 5 minutes in 2013. When the big system goes down, it will be a big change.</UTT>Oh, I totally agree with you. Google seems to have been with us forever, but was just founded in 1998.</UTT>At least every day everyone in the world uses a search. When asked for something like an address they say, "Google for it" when in doubt.</UTT>Everyone's life is part of Google. Just a couple of doctoral students at Stanford think it's all started.</UTT>Every big thing starts with a small step, like Google, Apple, Facebook.</UTT>Yep, Facebook started too when Kappberg was in college.</UTT>Nice talk, bye.</UTT>BTW, nice to chat to you as well. If you have an iphone, you have more compute power than the US' entire nuclear deterrent.</UTT>1

Hey, do you know why drive thrus were invented?</UTT>Hello there, I thought it was in the 70s, but I'm not sure. Do you know?</UTT>It was because the soldiers could get food and were not allowed to get out of the car in a state of fatigue.</UTT>That's a very interesting fact wasm.</UTT>Sure, the car has been around for a while, I don't know what to do if I don't have my car.</UTT>Sure they did. I think the first car was made back in 1886. Do you know where?</UTT>I think it's actually Germany, Benz. Then they are mass produced in America.</UTT>Good call. Yeah, it was it, then the old Ford started mass production.</UTT>I don't know if the Camaron is actually a French explorator.</UTT>I don't know that either, but I am very interested.</UTT>Have you heard of a guy who beat 90000 people in Gran Turismo?</UTT>That is very impressive holy cow. I wonder if they have one like that for FIFA.</UTT>I never played either. I have NES, N64 and Wii, but I have heard of FIFA as an incredible game.</UTT>That's awesome, I still have the original NES and keep it for my nephew to play with.</UTT>I too. I hooked it up the other day and played duck hunting.</UTT>That was very cool. I remember playing in my friend's basement firing screens.</UTT>On a totally different subject do you know that Pilgrim clothing is full color?</UTT>I don't know that, I guess it's plainer.</UTT>Black and white is only for formal occasions.</UTT>Oh, I always don't think that, which is very interesting.</UTT>It's a great chat, have a great day.</UTT>1

Hi, do you like comedy?</UTT>I love comedy.</UTT>I too. Do you like Bill Murray?</UTT>I like him especially in Ghostbusters.</UTT>Yes, he thinks his show 'Kung Fu Hustle' is a supreme achievement in modern age in terms of comedy. I don't think I'll ever see it.</UTT>I didn't see it either. But I saw the almighty Evan and it was a crazy $2 billion budget.</UTT>Whew, probably because all the special effects are animals. Green Lantern is supposed to be a comedy staring Jack Black, that's probably good.</UTT>I can't imagine it in any other way.</UTT>I know. I'm not sure why they changed it. Like the 3rd Rock from The Sun in the 90's?</UTT>It's pretty good, but prefers Friends.</UTT>I too like Friends, Seinfeld and Frasier, which in 1997 the 3rd rock beat out all 3 of those shows to win the Golden Globe for best comedy series.</UTT>Wow, 37 years ago, comedy won the best picture!</UTT>Crazy. I was surprised to find out that Comedian Central was created in 1989. I don't remember seeing it until the mid-1990s.</UTT>I probably wasn't allowed to watch it until the late 90s.</UTT>Nice, they also canceled over 100 shows since they were created lol.</UTT>Wow, do you know that Drew Carey served 8 years in the Marines?</UTT>I never knew that. That's pretty neat. He must be older than I thought he was.</UTT>He is claimed to have started his comedy career from that.</UTT>That's interesting, I love the Drew Carey show, now I have a song called "They" in my head. Do you know anyone who still has a rotary phone?</UTT>I don't, at least not working.</UTT>I haven't seen one in years. New York is an area code because dialing the fastest number on a rotary phone is the 'code' of the area.</UTT>I don't think that. Great chat today, but I have to run. Have a great day.</UTT>OK, I'll have to get to go too. Also, have a great day.</UTT>1

Hi, are you interested in telephone, fantasy, or William Shakespeare?</UTT>I'm addicted to my phone.</UTT>We are not all. Do you know that our telephones convert most of our voice sounds to electronic signals transmitted via cable and other communication channels to another phone that reproduces the sound to the receiver?</UTT>Crazy what they can also do. For example, the iPhone has more compute power than the iPhone, which deters the US Independent Communications Board.</UTT>That's something, isn't it? Also, with regards to phones, you know that two phone books that overlap each page cannot be separated.</UTT>I heard that, but I haven't seen a phone book in ages. If I ever find one again I'd be tempted to give up two.</UTT>Ha! Do you know that the cable that carried phones and internet data across the ocean is only 2.7 meters in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor?</UTT>So that takes a while to set down.</UTT>I agree. Another strange fact is that every minute you don't use your cell phone, UNICEF donates clean water to children in need.</UTT>That's pretty awesome, I wonder how Ii signed up for that one, I have to look into it.</UTT>That sounds kind of unusual, to say the least, but it might be worth checking out. Do you know that a single fold in the brain makes reality perception different from fantasy?</UTT>That's pretty cool. The brain is certainly complex. There are so many fantasy leagues and even spelling bees and Congress.</UTT>And some people are fantastic in fantasy. Have you heard of a Chicago janitor who wrote a fantasy manuscript with over 15000 pages and 300 water color illustrations?</UTT>Yeah, he called it the "unreal realm" It's too bad he can't recognize his genius in his lifetime.</UTT>I said boy, then he didn't have to be a janitor. He had a higher life station, like the knighted comedic fantasy author Terry Pratchett.</UTT>Serving the literature. I haven't read any of his work, have I?</UTT>I'm not. But I found out about interesting facts about literature, particularly Shakespeare. Do you know that Shakespeare invented names like Maria, Jesus and Olivia?</UTT>I don't know about that. I know of the phrases he still uses today, such as "chasing wild goose" and "full circle".</UTT>And what about good riddance and good riddance and breaking the ice in my heart? That's what it's been said about.</UTT>True, we use the phrase so much that we forget its origin or even what it really means.</UTT>I do the same, but sometimes wonder what those words are going to say. The devil incarnate again. I think some writer on TV will come up with that one, but it's Shakespeare.</UTT>1

Are you following American politics?</UTT>LOL, I'm not some surprised that there's only one phone number in the White House.</UTT>It definitely helps people reach the White House the fastest. I'm surprised they still use floppy disks to store them.</UTT>I know, that surprised me. I don't know of any white house private home replicas in Atlanta.</UTT>The building is beautiful, but I never thought of replicating it.</UTT>I agree that Jimmy Carter had to save his heat bill by turning down all the thermostats at 65. It was such a large house.</UTT>It is, and it has an even larger guest house.</UTT>LOL, I heard that too. Fred Rogers went to the Senate to fund PBS. How important it is for healthy children to develop.</UTT>I watched the video of his testimony because it was very emotional. I'm glad the Senate has listened to him and valued what he said.</UTT>I did too. Such a nice man is very interesting. I can't believe that Strom Thurmond filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes on the Senate floor.</UTT>That's all over the news today, and I wonder how much coverage it got back then.</UTT>Not stopping. He must be exhausted. Harry Truman's savings to the government were very good.</UTT>I wish the government would care more about saving money these days.</UTT>I agree it is way out of hand. Too bad Lincoln took the first presidential photo and had to have John Wilkes Booth on there.</UTT>Yes, but that makes the picture even more interesting and adds a whole layer of history to it as well.</UTT>What do you really feel about the last President FDR who spoke foreign languages?</UTT>I think it's a shame, but I also think that a lot of Americans speak only one language.</UTT>That's true. I was surprised that Woodrow Wilson, the US's only president, was a philosophy doctor.</UTT>That's a surprising fact. I wonder how many people have degrees in law instead.</UTT>I think they are a lot. Have a great day. Good chat.</UTT>Have a great day as well.</UTT>1

Hey, how do you like the Green Lantern movie?</UTT>Not as much as I like Kiunka's 4 song EP "Stay Up Latin".</UTT>What is that? Sorry, I've never heard that song, what kind of music is it?</UTT>Seattle quartet Kuinka plays an exuberant brand of pop music.</UTT>Oh, ok sorry to not hear that one. Do you know that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since it was created in 1989?</UTT>That's quite a few. I wonder how many refer to the joke of slipping a banana peel.</UTT>LOL, go back to the original comic book Green Lantern, originally supposed to be comedy, what comic book superhero comedy, you didn't see that!</UTT>Perhaps. The Greek comedy theater genre can be described as dramatic performance.</UTT>Really? Have you ever seen?</UTT>After reading about Northrop Frye, who depicts these two opposing sides as youth and old society.</UTT>Hey, you love dogs?</UTT>Yes, you know dogs can learn over 1000 words and have better reason than chimps.</UTT>I never thought they could be that smart. We're talking about all breeds, or maybe smarter and dumber.</UTT>Depends just like people. But some dogs in Moscow learned to use the subway.</UTT>Learning? Walking behind their owners on the train? Because somehow I didn't see them buying the actual tickets?</UTT>Not sure. The dog has a euro moment and enjoys the experience of solving problems to obtain rewards.</UTT>I guess, but I don't believe they understand what you mean when you point at something like distance, most dogs get it if you point at food on the floor, which is almost touching it.</UTT>True, dogs are the first domesticated species and have been selectively bred for millennia.</UTT>I mean, I heard that, but how did you study this, only lol or based on the facts of this drawing in the cave.</UTT>If nothing else, the long association between dog and human leads to a unique attunement to his behavior.</UTT>And now we dress these majestic animals in Halloween costumes and they probably regret their decision.</UTT>Perhaps, but the dog continues to perform many roles for humans.</UTT>My dog performed a hole in my backyard and he bounded my renter, knowing him for many years.</UTT>Then soiled. No hunting, no herding, no load pulling for them.</UTT>I guess I did. I don't hunt and can't kill animals, no matter how small. I bought some sheep to protect them. Do you have a dog?</UTT>Yes, I'm always amazed at how tongue dogs drink from their undersides.</UTT>Man got some weird dog.</UTT>Maybe so. Thanks for the chat man.</UTT>1

How are you today?</UTT>Hey there, pretty well, aren't you?</UTT>Same, my children love freezing, have you ever seen it?</UTT>I actually like it too. Do you know that the original titme was snow queen?</UTT>I'm a bot writer and Jennifer Lee is a co-writer?</UTT>She and the first movie directed by a woman at Disney.</UTT>Wow, that's great. I heard it was over a billion dollars gross in the box office.</UTT>That's amazing, but it's a great movie, so good job all around.</UTT>Disney renamed one of its famous titles, the snow queen.</UTT>The feminine title apparently doesn't do very well in the box office.</UTT>You don't use Amazon at all? Jeff is trying to take over the world.</UTT>He's sure, he's even guilting the clock in the mountain.</UTT>They say it is supposed to run for 10,000 years. The building is suggested to be named after you because it is the first customer.</UTT>And all the guys had to spend less than $30.</UTT>American postal services have contracted with Amazon.</UTT>Yeah, it was so convenient to have delivery on Sunday.</UTT>But they really all mark the packages on no one's home yeah they get in trouble for that. I don't know if Amazon owns IMBD.</UTT>Yeah, they purged it in 1998. They're just everywhere.</UTT>Online bookstores started out and they are now handing everything in.</UTT>Pretty much yes, if you speak a book, would you enjoy reading?</UTT>I do, and it would be nice to talk to you.</UTT>1

Good Morning, who are you today?</UTT>Super. What about you?</UTT>Same here, are you a dog fan?</UTT>Yes, but I love cars.</UTT>Oh cool, I can't believe the car was invented in 1886. I thought of it in the early 1900s.</UTT>In the 20th century, only cars came into human use. The next first use was the military, only for civilian use.</UTT>They were rapidly adopted in the US and it took longer to be accepted in West Europe.</UTT>Yes, only a large number of people in the US have cars compared to other parts of the world.</UTT>Do you know that the Cadillac car brand is named after French explorationist Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac who found Detroit?</UTT>Yes, in the middle of the 20th century, cars reached the biggest change with technology such as navigation systems, air conditioning and parking alarms.</UTT>That's so nice. I remember having to get around without a navigation system so hard. What kind of car do you own?</UTT>Hyundai, what about you?</UTT>I own a Jeep. I think it's crazy in South Africa that flamethrowers are legal to put in your car.</UTT>I think there is a way to protect cars. The car is propelled by an internal combustion engine with fossil fuels in it's running, but that creates so much pollution.</UTT>It really does. Do you know that some birds navigate Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?</UTT>It is very interesting. No trees or any buildings have shelter.</UTT>I'm sure they'll find a way to make it work. You've ever been to Australia. There are some neat birds there.</UTT>Crows are the most intelligent animals and sometimes imitate human speech. Do you know?</UTT>That was awesome to see. I know some birds like to mimic the sounds of cameras, car alarms and chainsaws. I bet that messed people up.</UTT>Sure, parrots are also good and competition in pigeon races is held.</UTT>It's fun to see that, great chat anyway. Have a good day.</UTT>1
Good Morning, who are you today?</UTT>Super. What about you?</UTT>Here's a thought: Are you a dog fan?</UTT>Yes, but I love cars.</UTT>Oh cool, I can't believe the car was invented in 1886. I thought of it in the early 1900s.</UTT>In the 20th century, only cars came into human use. The next first use was the military, only for civilian use.</UTT>They were rapidly adopted in the US and it took longer to be accepted in West Europe.</UTT>Yes, only a large number of people in the US have cars compared to other parts of the world.</UTT>Do you know that the Cadillac car brand is named after French explorationist Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac who found Detroit?</UTT>Yes, in the middle of the 20th century, cars reached the biggest change with technology such as navigation systems, air conditioning and parking alarms.</UTT>I'm so nice. The way I remember, I had to think around without a navigation system so hard. The way I own only any person.</UTT>Hyundai, what about you?</UTT>I own a Jeep. I think it's crazy in South Africa that flamethrowers are legal to put in your car.</UTT>I think there is a way to protect cars. The car is propelled by an internal combustion engine with fossil fuels in it's running, but that creates so much pollution.</UTT>It really does. Do you know that some birds navigate Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?</UTT>It is very interesting. No trees or any buildings have shelter.</UTT>I'm sure they'll find a way to make it work. You've ever been to Australia. There are some neat birds there.</UTT>Crows are the most intelligent animals and sometimes imitate human speech. Do you know?</UTT>That was awesome to see. I know some birds like to mimic the sounds of cameras, car alarms and chainsaws.

Hello, do you know much about the earth?</UTT>Not much other than I live there.</UTT>Good enough. The day appears to be only 5.5 hours when the earth was created.</UTT>That's crazy, how about one nap.</UTT>I don't know when I'll nap. And 71% of the earth is covered in water.</UTT>Wow, that seems to be a lot. I wonder how much salt water there is like in the water world.</UTT>The majority of the forests are forest. Sadly, 80% of the forest is destroyed.</UTT>That makes me sad. Teddie Roosevelt is a known conservationist. He made the service of the National Park and the forest.</UTT>Wow, he's goofing. Do you know that by the end of the century the Earth would be free of helium?</UTT>Is that bad? We can make it in the lab. Old shoes can perform better than new ones.</UTT>Apparently the shoes that date back to 5000 years ago are much stronger.</UTT>That cobbler can make ballet shoes. They go through 4 pairs a week.</UTT>That's a lot of shoes do you know how to keep them fresh smelling?</UTT>Freeze?</UTT>Haha Great option, but also teabags.</UTT>Can you imagine wheelbarrowing through 32000 books at age 85?</UTT>No, but I heard Gladstone did that. What an amazing man.</UTT>I just gave up. There are more libraries than McDonalds so that's a good start.</UTT>I like that fact a lot. Have you heard of the Liberation of Things?</UTT>I haven't. What is it?</UTT>There is a library in Sacramento where you can borrow other stuff besides books. Nice chat.</UTT>1

Hey, enjoy the swim?</UTT>I love going to the beach, but I am not a strong swimmer.</UTT>I'm. The US is really strong in the swimming world apparently. We won the gold medals most.</UTT>It might be because of the swimsuit. In the 2008 Olympics, the swimsuit was banned because it won 94 percent of all races.</UTT>I wonder if it's swimming with them all.</UTT>Funny. I think it's made of type of material, but I'm not sure.</UTT>The real test is to bind their hands and legs and make them swim in it to see how they do like dolphins.</UTT>Front crawling is supposed to be the fastest and most efficient stroke.</UTT>It's going to benefit my kids competitive swimmers. My eldest is also pretty good at breast stroke.</UTT>I do freestyle, anything that keeps me from drowning.</UTT>Apparently Native Americans introduced front crawling to early British coming over.</UTT>I don't think the Brits are swimmers. Cold there.</UTT>They are sailor so they need to swim for some time. All students at Cornell have to take a basic swimming test. I wonder if they can doggy paddle?</UTT>I'm sure they can doggy paddle, back I'd like to float in there most.</UTT>What is football? A fan?</UTT>I didn't really watch football until I started dating my ex. He loved the Patriots.</UTT>Former Patriots running back Ben Jarvis never fumbled in football. Pretty impressive.</UTT>That's wild. He must have had glue on his hands.</UTT>Hah, something like that.</UTT>lol I wonder what it is.</UTT>Maybe luck. Anyway, nice chat.</UTT>1

Do you know that a man in France is trying to impersonate a government official and selling the Eiffel Tower once a second?</UTT>I believe it.</UTT>The Norwegian government donated 1 billion dollars in 2008 to help save the Amazon rainforest. They're way cool.</UTT>The Netherlands built a 160 mph bus. Why would anyone want to go that fast on a bus? The Norwegians are very concerned about the earth.</UTT>Apparently Wikileaks published a government plan to destroy Wikileaks. That didn't work out too well.</UTT>Wikileaks is good, government scared them.</UTT>You follow sports. I don't realize that there are 39 of 50 state basketball coaches or state employees with the highest pay.</UTT>I'm not really interested in sports but it does impress me. I hope they're worth it.</UTT>I also don't know if the US Supreme Court had a top floor basketball court known as the highest court on land until recently.</UTT>That's funny, I wonder how many times it's used, because that lot of supreme people are older.</UTT>James Nismith, the inventor of basketball, was the only lost coach at the University of Kansas in its history. Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.</UTT>I wonder what prompted him to invent basketball and how he came up with all the rules. So he must have had some help.</UTT>The dunk has been banned for over a decade because it is dominated by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</UTT>I don't know about that. Head coach Joanne Boyle led the University of Virginia to quit her job to go to Senegal to finalize the adoption of her daughter. I think that was really brave.</UTT>I believe her daughter attended kindergarten at Charlottesville Day School, danced ballet and hip hop and played violin.</UTT>Too bad they had to travel back to Africa for this and she lost her job. They could have been there for a long time.</UTT>Boyle keeps his daughter in Virginia for fear of her health. I totally get that and understand it as a parent.</UTT>She was lucky to have a family to help her out. But I don't know what they would do if adoption stalled.</UTT>This is why she resigned as coach when her team was knocked out of the NBA Division 1 tournament.</UTT>This is more important to her.</UTT>Thankfully, she has a 82 year old mother, 5 siblings and a very supportive community.</UTT>That's really good for her.</UTT>Talking to you is a pleasure.</UTT>1

Hi, have you played any fantasy sports game?</UTT>I never had, but I heard you could even play Fantasy spelling Bee. I can't promise to try it some day, one way or another.</UTT>I heard that too. I like playing fantasy football every year, but only about.</UTT>It sounds really fun, I'm just too busy to be fun. A fantasy congress is a thing.</UTT>I agree, I can't believe people are doing a fantasy congress, that's just funny.</UTT>I wonder what other people draft, all of it is fantasy. A single fold in the brain makes a difference in perception of fantasy from reality (yikes, scary, humans need to learn more about how fragile our bodies and brains are, I think).</UTT>Wow, that's very interesting. Very fragile brain. Terry Pratchett was knighted for his literature service.</UTT>Wow, I don't mind knighting, it sounds so cool to me.</UTT>That sounds pretty cool. One time a Chicago comedian wrote a fantasy manuscript of 15145 pages.</UTT>Jeeze, I hope the comedian pays for that.</UTT>I hope so too. Do you like football?</UTT>I like football. Football and soccer are both to a degree, but most are football.</UTT>I do too. Do you like the quarterback position?</UTT>I do. Do you know that Kelan Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL?</UTT>I don't know that, I remember Vick being a lefty as well.</UTT>Oh really, I personally love being ambidextrous.</UTT>That's cool. You know, Alex Smith took so many AP classes in high school that he was a junior starting college.</UTT>I don't know about that. I think it's good to keep up with education no matter what other opportunities there are on the way.</UTT>I agree. In the 1960s top bowlers made more than the top NFL stars.</UTT>That's crazy, I've never bowled. Former Patriot quarterback Benjarvus Green-Ellis didn't fumble in football during his NFC career. That's a great record to have.</UTT>I can't believe he never fumbled. Pretty crazy. Have a real chat. Have a good day.</UTT>1

How did it go? Do you like sports?</UTT>Pretty good. Are you? I'm glad the baseball season is about to start back up.</UTT>You know of a Dubai golf course that requires 400000 gallons of water a day. Such waste seems unnecessary.</UTT>I don't, but I totally agree with you. I guess Dubai is in a desert region but needs a lot of water to keep the grass green, but it still seems wrong to just play golf there.</UTT>Even in the US one uses only 312k a day, not a small amount, much less than that single course.</UTT>Dubai is mostly for wealthy people, isn't that what can explain the excess?</UTT>Actually it isn't even as wealthy as New York or London. It is actually being marketed to seem very wealthy, although it isn't actually that much more than Abu Dhabi in the world.</UTT>I don't know about that, I always thought about Dubai, it looks like I believe in hype, you know Babe Ruth is the most famous golfer in us, I speak for hype.</UTT>Haha, he has to be much better than Michael Jordan. You know Samuel L Jackson put a golf clause in his contract that allows him to play golf twice a week while producing the movie. So he really loves golf.</UTT>He really has to and people have to love him to allow it in his contract.</UTT>You know kickball is also called soccer ball in Canada. That's kinda weird.</UTT>It sounds weird, do you know that the ymca invented softball?</UTT>They also invented volleyball, softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball ones though, since I'm pretty sure they were around before the YMCA.</UTT>I don't know. I heard James Naismith invented basketball somewhere. I'm not sure if he was a YMCA or not.</UTT>A man found a $300,000 baseball card in his grandfather's attic. Talk about a stroke of luck.</UTT>That's lucky, I heard baseball is super popular in Japan, you know. It's surprising them there to learn that it's our national pastime.</UTT>It doesn't sound like becoming a softball player is a good sport with an average salary of $5K-$6000 as of 2014.</UTT>It really doesn't. It's odd how low it is considering that softball is the first sport shown on ESPN.</UTT>Well I would say soccer is the best sport because it makes more money than combined Basketball, Football and Golf.</UTT>I agree, in softball, do you know that the longest game in college history was 31 innings?</UTT>Wow, that's crazy long. Well, nice to chat with you. Have a good day.</UTT>1

Hey, have you listened to country music?</UTT>Thanks for the question, good one. I listen to country music as a matter of fact.</UTT>I don't know that only two African Americans are in the fame hall. It may be true, but it is.</UTT>I can think of Charles Pride. I'm not sure of other people. What do you do?</UTT>I think of Charles Pride as well, it is quite obvious to me, but I have no idea who is the second person. I have read the opinion that country music needs more than less politics, by the way. Do you agree with it?</UTT>No, I don't agree. I want to hear good music, but somebody doesn't view politics, whether I agree with it or not. Just sing.</UTT>True, I agree with you, I always think country music is the best reflection of the United States, something special, rock, pop, etc. everywhere. True, America, but...</UTT>Do you know that the country music was originally inspired and derived from Celtic music?</UTT>I know it is part of the Celtic culture but I have no idea what things are like English ballads (I can't even imagine how it sounds).</UTT>Country music originates from the folk songs of the working class of the working class of the working class of the working class, blending various different tunes, ballads, songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.</UTT>Cowboy song added by people in Texas too. Really nice mix. lol</UTT>True, don't forget the Texas swings, well I love the subgenre, you know the original intent of the Fender Stratocaster was country music on a side note, right? Hard to believe that, right?</UTT>Hard to believe, you just want to change the topic if you don't mind. Do you watch TV?</UTT>No problem, I watch little TV as well.</UTT>I honestly don't even have a TV at home. For me, all comes from a laptop. I don't know if I watch more Fox News than CNN and MSNBC combined.</UTT>Not TV, that's kind of unusual, not much of that is heard. Most people have at least 5 at home. I can believe that Fox News is very big, and a lot of people are sick of the anti-Trump message that continues to spew on CNN and MSNBC.</UTT>True, my best friend has exactly the 5 TV's you say. I also don't know what President Nixon has to do with Fox News. I don't know that.</UTT>What an interesting thing to not realize that Tricky Dick had anything to do with creating Fox News.</UTT>That's interesting, well chat with you here, have a good day.</UTT>I enjoyed a chat with my friend as well.</UTT>Thanks.</UTT>1

Hi, have you seen the movie Incredibles? Good Morning.</UTT>I saw the first one, but not the second. I like it a lot.</UTT>Nicely, I'm the same as you. I hope to see the second one soon. The predominant political comment was from the Voice of the Voilet Sarah Vowell.</UTT>It's crazy that you recognize their voice elsewhere. Do you know that Edna Mode is the voice of the director?</UTT>I agree, wow, I don't know, I don't know what the present day events of incredible people were set in the 1960s, I think it was more modern.</UTT>Wow, I'll have to watch it again to see if I can pick that up. I think it's modern too.</UTT>I like other forms of entertainment too. I used to love the original Nintendo and it finally discontinued in Japan in 2003.</UTT>That's the best game system ever. I always loved Mario Brothers even if it was 54.</UTT>I totally agree with you. The entertainment was originally developed, existed in many forms, and was even supported by the Royal Court, so it was available to all citizens.</UTT>That's good. Do you know that Ronald Reagan was once told he didn't look good enough as president?</UTT>Wow, that is very ironic. The entertainment executives clearly appear to not know what they are talking about.</UTT>But Bill Nye appears to be looking like Steve Martin. He won the look-alike contest and that launched his fame.</UTT>Wow, that's amazing, like the comic gene? I love comic central and it was made back in 1989.</UTT>Comedy is one of my favorites. Since then Comedy Central has cancelled 100 shows. They obviously know what works.</UTT>Wow, they did..hapelle show is one of my favorites..Green Lantern originally starred Jack Black.. funny guy that made it interesting.</UTT>It's probably like a Deadpool movie.</UTT>Yeah, I love the Kung Fu Hustle movie too. Bill Murray thinks comedy is the best achievement of the modern era. I haven't even seen it.</UTT>I'm not. I may think of other things that are probably more funny than that.</UTT>Yeah agree, there's tons of content out there, do you like political satire? It's a different parody from a critique of certain genres without actually condemning them.</UTT>I enjoy political satire, I feel it's just too easy in the current political scene. So much to pick from and do with it.</UTT>It's almost like there's an easy out this day, it's just too easy, you say. Have a great day.</UTT>1

He won the look-alike contest and that launched his fame.</UTT>Wow, that's amazing, like the comic gene? I love comic central and it was made back in 1989.</UTT>Comedy is one of my favorites. Since then Comedy Central has cancelled 100 shows. They obviously know what works.</UTT>Wow, they did..hapelle show is one of my favorites..Green Lantern originally starred Jack Black.. funny guy that made it interesting.</UTT>It's probably like a Deadpool movie.</UTT>Yeah, I love the Kung Fu Hustle movie too. Bill Murray thinks comedy is the best achievement of the modern era. I haven't even seen it.</UTT>I'm not. I may think of other things that are probably more funny than that.</UTT>Yeah agree, there's tons of content out there, do you like political satire? It's a different parody from a critique of certain genres without actually condemning them.</UTT>I enjoy political satire, I feel it's just too easy in the current political scene. So much to pick from and do with it.</UTT>It's almost like there's an easy out this day, it's just too easy, you say. Have a great day.</UTT>0
Hello, are you a fan of country music?</UTT>I honestly can't say I am. You suggest.</UTT>It's okay, I like older country music. Do you know that the Fender stratocaster is intended for country music?</UTT>Really, that's pretty cool. George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins.</UTT>LOL, that's a lot of cash between them. Only two African Americans are in the country music hall of fame.</UTT>I guess you haven't seen many African American musicians.</UTT>I can only think of Charles Pride and Darius Rucker.</UTT>I don't think I could even name Charles Pride.</UTT>I only know one of his songs, Kiss an Angel Good Morning, because it was popular when I was a kid. Henry Ford helped finance the popularization of country music because he feared the urban decadence of jazz music.</UTT>That's kind of crazy and somewhat racist.</UTT>I never knew that, did you follow any celebrities?</UTT>I really don't and prefer to keep up with people who contribute to society and aren't pure entertainers.</UTT>What about Sesame Street? Caroline Burnett appeared on the first episode of Sesame Street.</UTT>I loved it as a kid, still think it's great for kids, then did she do the ear tug?</UTT>I remember that. Who knows, Pixar has a secret room that celebrities often visit. I don't wonder what's such a big secret there.</UTT>I wonder if it's like a secret handshake to get in too? If it does become noteworthy, it must be pretty cool.</UTT>That's funny, I guess. Judy made $12 million per episode, the highest paid celebrity ever (LeBron James) I've never even watched a person's show.</UTT>Never? It's classic trashy TV, check it out if you ever want a good laugh.</UTT>The first actor in the film "Aladdin" Robin Williams started the trend of celebrities performing vocals in animated films. I had a good time having a chat with you lol</UTT>Very nice chat, have a fantastic night.</UTT>Have a good night too.</UTT>1

Do you know that dogs can have 12 different types of blood and can donate blood at blood drives?</UTT>I don't. Google is really cool as a dog company.</UTT>What does it mean to be a dog company?</UTT>I assume they allow dogs to work. Maybe because dogs can learn over 1000 words.</UTT>I'm not sure how that would help Google.</UTT>Morals are very important in any company. Google has a self drive car with aggressive mode.</UTT>I never trusted the drive technology, what is that aggressive mode?</UTT>Self drive technology is scary. Not scary like a horror movie though.</UTT>But I love driving on my own, don't you?</UTT>It's very therapeutic for me. Then I love driving until I've emptied the tank, there's little arrow on the fuel gauge.</UTT>Ha ha I heard you man I can't believe people actually bought a car to drive for me.</UTT>People are really lazy these days. I don't live in Ohio at least with the stupid laws where you can't warm your car.</UTT>What do you mean, why can't you warm your car?</UTT>No, you have to ask the state of Ohio lol</UTT>I mean good warm up for the car. Silly Ohio.</UTT>And who wants to get into a cold car? You like horror movies.</UTT>I love them.</UTT>Love how Scream is supposed to be scary.</UTT>I don't like Scream because there's not enough horror.</UTT>Wow, you love gory stuff?</UTT>Sure.</UTT>As long as it has a good storyline, I like good horror movies.</UTT>I agree the story is very important, thanks for the great chat, have a great holiday.</UTT>Thanks!</UTT>TY</UTT>1

Hi there, how did it go? Are you a baseball fan?</UTT>Hi, I do very well, thank you. I watch baseball on occasion and am a casual fan.</UTT>Are you rooting for a specific team? Here's a long time Yankee fan.</UTT>You probably don't like this, but I'm a Red Sox fan. I heard Eric Hosmer signed the San Diego Padres for 145 million in an 8 year contract.</UTT>Haha, you're right, I don't like the Red Sox. Yes, I believe Hosmer's contract was last year. I think that ended up being a bad contract.</UTT>I too think for a proven player, he is 28 years old, plays first base positions and does very well for the Royals.</UTT>He was 30 and late at the end of that deal, and nowhere near as good as overpay definitely. Machado and Harper were not crazy about the $300 million deal, but he was.</UTT>Nothing like that. He won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I'd like to see him in the Red Sox uniform.</UTT>The Red Sox are now only weak on the first base, true. Who started Mitch Moreland?</UTT>You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer made $2 million each in the first 5 seasons of his time with the Padres.</UTT>That's smart to load it front-line. How many of these guys get to play baseball is crazy. It doesn't even physically demand as much as football, basketball or hockey.</UTT>I completely agree with you. That's way more physically a sport than baseball. You know the Downers lost more world series championships than any other baseball team.</UTT>They've been so long that it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. Funny thing is that prior to the cubs recent win, they won just before the Ottoman Empire still existed.</UTT>Ha, Dallas is bad, Red Sox crushed them.</UTT>I hate how good Mookie Betty is. I think the Yankees will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year.</UTT>I believe that. The Yankees are a very talented club and will always give the Red Sox hard time no matter whether we play them here or the Yankees.</UTT>Are you in Fenway Park? I actually saw the game on my trip to Boston. The stadium was really cool.</UTT>I've been to Fenway Park a few times and it's really nice especially when we're playing the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because they are owned by the Padres.</UTT>I don't know if you're hearing or not. The Padres just signed Manny Machado this year. I think he'll be in a $300 million contract for 10 years.</UTT>You are correct, they built a team and I think they will do well in the long term, but I'm not too sure they'll make it to the World Series.</UTT>I don't think they have a pitch yet. That's so important to winning the World Series anyway, nice chat and enjoy the rest of your day.</UTT>You are correct, it all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. Very nice to chat with you today as well. Have a nice day.</UTT>Care.</UTT>1

Do you like the NFL?</UTT>I do. Do you know that women can play too?</UTT>They are good to try because there is no rule that they play there.</UTT>And then if they are of quality they join the rest of the team.</UTT>Yeah, it's an average game that only lasts 11 minutes when switching topics.</UTT>I know, yet we've been glued to TV for hours during the game.</UTT>I know. Engineers make more than football players for a lifetime too.</UTT>They also have longer careers so maybe they can help a bit there.</UTT>Good true point. Did you hear that Saints cheerleader rule?</UTT>They are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players.</UTT>And if they walk, they also need to leave mid meal.</UTT>Yeah, it's too bad it's still around. Do you like Brady?</UTT>I love him because he is so good. He is popular, but his wife seems to be more popular.</UTT>And she also made his own double.</UTT>Yeah, his coach, Beckichick, lists him on the weekly injury report.</UTT>Yeah, guys never had a strawberry in their lives.</UTT>Yeah strange, but I guess he may also be allergic to them.</UTT>That's possible. He won or lost the Super Bowl with the Patriots by 3-4 points.</UTT>Yeah, he never threw 30 touchdown passes prior to 2007.</UTT>And after that, 50 things to have. Nice chat tonight.</UTT>Same here, have a good one.</UTT>1

Hey there, you're watching the NBA?</UTT>I love watching basketball, what about you?</UTT>I'm too. Who are your favorite players?</UTT>Cool, and the player I'm all for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</UTT>Is that a guy who is banned from using dunks?</UTT>That's him. College basketball has been banned as a dunk for over a decade. Too funny.</UTT>I know, let them if they can handle it. Do you know who invented basketball?</UTT>I believe that was James Naismith.</UTT>Yes, and he also coaches the U of Kansas only who loses.</UTT>That's so ironic, the only coach in the history of the University of Kansas to lose was the coach who lost, but you invented the game. That took a lot of ribbing over years.</UTT>Exactly. At least in many states the coaches are paid highest.</UTT>Not only are there basketball and football coaches. Do you know that the Supreme Court has a top floor basketball court known as the highest on the land?</UTT>I wonder if they use it a lot during their lunch break. Do you know the NZ basketball team's nickname?</UTT>You can see Ruth Baker Ginsberg in court. I heard a crazy tall black person.</UTT>That's it. Do you know Reggie Miller?</UTT>He is in the fame hall.</UTT>And his sister, although she was good, apparently was always better than him.</UTT>That must really suck big time.</UTT>Or maybe he's been pushed to keep trying to get better. Do you know Allen Irving?</UTT>Well, that's true too. I know a good player named Allen Irving.</UTT>True, he has a lifetime contract with Reebok, nice chat.</UTT>1

Good morning, have you ever shop on Amazon?</UTT>I love it. It was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994.</UTT>It's hard to believe it's been around so long. For some reason it feels new to me. Did it start out as just a bookstore?</UTT>That's really interesting. The first customer spent $27.95 and got the building's name.</UTT>He's a lucky man, smart because he bought from a company that was unknown at the time and turned it into a powerhouse today.</UTT>Do you know that the United States Postal Service contracted with Amazon to deliver the package Sunday?</UTT>I know that, and that's just saying that Amazon is exactly powerful. As far as I know they are the only companies with that contract.</UTT>I think so. I also saw people working in Amazon's warehouse walking 7-15 miles a day.</UTT>Well that's a good thing. It's a great way to exercise and make money at the same time.</UTT>LOL, exactly. You know Amazon passed up Walmart as the most valuable company in the United States.</UTT>I believe it. I shop at Walmart, but I like to shop online. UPS is true, and won't ship stuff to you in a day or so. Walmart doesn't do that either.</UTT>I would exactly prefer Amazon. I just do grocery at Wal-Mart. I see the public company as the 3rd most valuable company in the United States.</UTT>I guess Google and Facebook are probably the top two. Amazon could just move up though. They now have their own film and television studios.</UTT>Actually, I read that they were behind Apple and Microsoft.</UTT>Really? Well, lol, I'm wrong. Well, they can still move up.</UTT>They may be. They are the world's largest Internet company in revenue.</UTT>And right behind Alaba and the total sales. I wonder if that is because of the size of China's population?</UTT>It might be. I also see them as the largest employer in the United States after Walmart.</UTT>What do you think of their cashless start up stores?</UTT>I guess most people don't carry cash so it makes sense. I read that Amazon has owned IMBD since 1998. I don't know that.</UTT>I don't know that either. It sounds like Amazon was expanding early. When they did it was only a 4 year old business. Well, I had to go a bit. Nice to chat with you. Have a great day.</UTT>1

I greet you, hope you are well. This reading is certainly interesting.</UTT>Hello, who are you? Like reading. Read is a simple word, but the scientific definition of an article I've read sounds complex to me.</UTT>We don't have to think about reading when we do it well, so it's kind of interesting to think about it. Are you an avid reader?</UTT>I used to be busy with work, grandkids, etc. In the 18th century people apparently panicked because they began enjoying reading novels.</UTT>Yeah, that cracks me up. I also like the idea of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien competing to laugh at you lose. I used to be a real nerd, but I read most of it now on the internet.</UTT>I read most on the internet too. I've heard of CS Lewis and the competition you're talking about.</UTT>All articles are interesting. I have no idea that the sun accounts for 99.86 percent of our solar system. Our little planet is pretty insignificant.</UTT>It's scary, isn't it? I don't know if the sun is actually white. I think it's yellow.</UTT>It's amazing we can capture the power of the lightening bolt. Dr. Frankenstein has the right idea.</UTT>They appear to be hotter than the surface of the sun. I always thought it was the hottest thing in the universe.</UTT>The next biggest star is even scarier, one billion times bigger than our sun.</UTT>Our sun is so tiny I don't think it is, it is way scary.</UTT>So...</UTT>I think you're trying to say something. Professional soccer apparently makes more money than football, baseball, golf, basketball and hockey combined. How can it be?</UTT>S</UTT>Hello, are you still there?</UTT>My text box keeps disappearing. Sorry about that. I tried to ask if you are a soccer fan.</UTT>I'm more into football, but I've watched some games on TV with my boss. He's from England. I like soccer less harmful to the player.</UTT>I've never really become a fan because I grew up around soccer. It didn't make it to my backwater Indiana town.</UTT>Soccer player Mesut Ozil of Germany donated his 300000 euro winning bonus to pay for poor children's surgery in Brazil. It was very nice.</UTT>I guess that's the truth about the part where soccer makes more money than any sport. I've never seen a pro game in the U.S. though.</UTT>I have to run now. Nice to chat to you. Have a good night.</UTT>1

Do you watch more TV or YouTube?</UTT>I watched more of YouTube, which is also the second largest search engine on the Internet.</UTT>I like youtube, I don't like the only video ever about that, the baby from Justin Bieber.</UTT>LOL, that's the most disliked video on youtube.</UTT>Well, it's part of me, lol, iii. Have you entered a big gangnam style phase? That song almost broke YouTube.</UTT>That song is as hell catchy. I play a fair share. You know that youtube and facebook make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America. People love their videos.</UTT>That makes sense, you only hear people talk about YouTube or Netflix. Ever catch a TV show?</UTT>I watched TV, I even watched them in black and white as a kid.</UTT>Wow, that's interesting, I need my color television, have you ever watched pokemon?</UTT>LOL, I never watched it, but my kids watched it a lot and still watch it, even as they grow. I'm pretty sure they saw all 750 episodes of it.</UTT>I thought I'd watched the majority of that when I was a kid. Did you kids watch Thomas the Train?</UTT>They did. Who is Thomas' voice?</UTT>Ringo Starr, George Carlin, Alec Baldwin and many others are different.</UTT>That's right, I remember Ringo and George now, but I don't remember Alec though. Have you ever watched the 1970s show, lol?</UTT>I used to love watching those shows on netflix and youtube. What do you do?</UTT>I do. If you go to YouTube you can find all 10 epiodes the British renamed it to "a day like this".</UTT>That's hilarious, that's a poor show. That was almost like in the 80's, probably too long.</UTT>Nice, you know, there was only one episode of Simpsons where Bart was not mentioned or appeared. LOL</UTT>That's so crazy, simpson also sent flowers to South Park when he made his famous family guy episode. Good chat.</UTT>I don't know if they did that, sure I'd have to look it up on youtube. And good to chat with you too.</UTT>Have a great weekend.</UTT>1
Watch more youtube?</UTT>I watched more of YouTube, which is also the second largest search engine on the Internet.</UTT>I like youtube, I don't like the only video ever about that, the baby from Justin Bieber.</UTT>LOL that's a video you don't like on YouTube.</UTT>Well, it's part of me, lol, iii. Have you entered a big gangnam style phase? That song almost broke YouTube.</UTT>That song is as hell catchy. I play a fair share. You know that youtube and facebook make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America. People love their videos.</UTT>That makes sense, you only hear people talk about YouTube or Netflix. Ever catch a TV show?</UTT>I watched TV, I even watched them in black and white as a kid.</UTT>Wow, that's interesting, I need my color television.</UTT>LOL, I never watched it, but my kids watched it a lot and still watch it, even as they grow. I'm pretty sure they saw all 750 episodes of it.</UTT>I thought I'd watched the majority of that when I was a kid. Did you kids watch Thomas the Train?</UTT>They do.</UTT>Ringo Starr, George Carlin, Alec Baldwin and many others of the style were famous.</UTT>That's right, now I don't like Ringo or George as much as I do Alec, did the 1970s show ever last, lol.</UTT>I used to love watching those shows on netflix and youtube. What do you do?</UTT>I do. If you go to YouTube you can find all 10 epiodes the British renamed it to "a day like this".</UTT>That's hilarious, that's a poor show. That was almost like in the 80's, probably too long.</UTT>Nice, you know, there was only one episode of Simpsons where Bart was not mentioned or appeared. LOL</UTT>That's so crazy, simpson also sent flowers to South Park when he made his famous family guy episode. Good chat.</UTT>I don't know if they did that, sure I'd have to look it up on youtube. And good to chat with you too.</UTT>Have a great weekend.</UTT>0
Do you know much about the President?</UTT>I know only President Wilson has a doctorate in philosophy.</UTT>Nice. Do you know who are the 3 richest presidents?</UTT>Hmm, I have no idea who that person is, and who is that person?</UTT>Jefferson, Washington, JFK.</UTT>Nice. Do you know that Lincoln was the first president to have a photo of the inauguration?</UTT>Nice. Indonesian President is a pop star.</UTT>Nice! Also, John Wilkes booth in the photo with Lincoln!</UTT>Wow, the Indonesian guy has already released 3 albums.</UTT>Wow, he's good. In Guatemala, you know that a relative of the president can never run for that position.</UTT>Nice, and I guess that's how they combat the nepotism and such issues.</UTT>Maybe. Do you know that Congress can declare someone an honorary citizen?</UTT>Nice. Don't know that. Since 1909, Republicans and Democrats have played baseball games every year.</UTT>Nice, and they keep the winners scoring?</UTT>The Republican party currently leads by three points.</UTT>Nice. Steven Colbert supported immigration work visas and once went in front of Congress to defend them.</UTT>Wow, that's amazing. Elmo also testified once in front of Congress?</UTT>Like Elmo from Sesame Street?</UTT>And the only witnesses are not humans.</UTT>Wow, cool, have you watched much TV?</UTT>Actually, I and you like to watch Simpsons all the time.</UTT>1

You follow the US Senate?</UTT>I do somewhat. I know 100 senators from the US and two from each state.</UTT>That's been the way for at least a long time, and the Senate chamber is in the capitol.</UTT>Senator Stom Thurmond holds the longest record of lone senator filibustering. He stayed on the floor for an incredible 24 hours and 18 minutes, without stopping.</UTT>He did. LOL, that's an odd record. You know, the US Senate used the same Gavel for almost two centuries until he cracked it by Nixon.</UTT>Wow, that's been running for a long time. It must be in a museum somewhere. Harry Truman was selected as vice president because the Senate Truman Committee found so much corruption and waste that it saved the government between $1 billion and $1 trillion.</UTT>I guess that's a great reason, he's undercover about a big secret and most remain quiet.</UTT>I agree. You know Woodrow Wilson, the only US president to have a doctorate in philosophy. That kind of surprised me.</UTT>That's surprising, and I guess most former presidents have one.</UTT>I too. When the President still loses the popular vote, he is elected to the presidency. I don't quite understand why we never use the popular vote.</UTT>It's a weird system, one day it can change, and the election runter just became a vice president in 1805.</UTT>Now you can imagine that. Trump and Hillary? LOL!</UTT>That's caos and nothing will happen.</UTT>It was chaos. The first President Lincoln was photographed for his inauguration, and John Wilkes Booth was photographed for his. I never knew that. Creepy.</UTT>That's creepy because he was considered to have shot himself later. Do you know that the White House has two twin buildings?</UTT>And I know, I don't know that about buildings. I wonder why. I simply know the first phone of the White House.</UTT>It's iii. I have no idea about that, but the white house sure has some curious and cool facts.</UTT>It does. Who knows. A replica of the Atlanta White House built in a private home. LOL.</UTT>I really have heard of one in Ireland and never knew it was in Atlanta as well.</UTT>I don't know either. You know you can mail birth announcements to the White House and they'll send you a congratulatory card back. I wish I had that when my kid was born.</UTT>Oh, that's so cool, I'll do it next time I expect kids.</UTT>1

Have you watched the NBA?</UTT>I do. Do you like Tim Duncan?</UTT>I like him. Do you like Reggie Miller?</UTT>I do. Tim Duncan won't go to the NBA until he finishes college.</UTT>Nice kid, good. Miller was great, but his sister was always better.</UTT>Wow, they must be a very talented family in sports.</UTT>She once scored 105 points and broke the national record of 8.</UTT>Wow, Impressive. While most NBA players are financially difficult when they retire,</UTT>Unfortunately that isn't happening. Have you heard of the deal that Irving signed with Reebok?</UTT>No, they offered him good?</UTT>Trust me, guys are set in life, like LeBron?</UTT>I actually did. You know he refused a $1 million offer from Reebok when he was 18.</UTT>Wow, why is he in the sequel to Space Jam?</UTT>Because he said Nike or Adidas would offer more so he wouldn't settle for that.</UTT>Wow, he's got a better offer then?</UTT>Next year, Nike will offer him 90 million.</UTT>Nice deal then, you know he's the highest paid celebrity.</UTT>Nice, he was involved in many things, so I guess that makes sense.</UTT>Yeah, he once raised all 6 million for charity on the televised decision.</UTT>Nice. He really hated in 2012 when he decided to join the Miami Heats.</UTT>Wow, I guess people don't like it when he leaves his old team.</UTT>1

Good Morning, do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Hello there, I listen to the radio most of the time driving to work and back. Suggestions!</UTT>I listen to satellite radio in the car, but not so much AM/FM anymore.</UTT>I went on a few road trips with my car where they had satellite radios, it was very cool with so many stations I chose.</UTT>They seem to have every type of music you can want on there. I like variety because I get tired of hearing the same song over and over.</UTT>Really good variety. Do you know that all the Canadian music played on the radio must have at least 40% Canadian bands and acts?</UTT>That's a great rule to help support local artists. I wonder who got the job to monitor that.</UTT>I agree. I don't know how much the Canadian public likes it, but it's really good for all those local bands.</UTT>I'm sure it doesn't even notice that much, you don't really think about the nationality of the artist when you listen to the song. There is a Finnish station that airs a Latin news program every week.</UTT>That's true, I think a lot of the music I listen to doesn't come from the US. And that's really pretty cool.</UTT>It is important to expose yourself to different cultures and there are easy and fun ways to do that. I know I enjoy listening to a lot of different acts from different parts of the world.</UTT>Very true again. Do you know what soldiers used to call small radios they made during WWII?</UTT>It's really amazing that radios can be made from the smallest to the crazyst items.</UTT>Sure it is, I guess they are called Foxhole Radio if I am correct.</UTT>They are a bit of a pencil and razor maker, their function is very impressive.</UTT>It's really, the radio storm on Jupiter is also impressive.</UTT>I would love to hear that sound on the radio. I wonder if it sounds static?</UTT>I agree, and wonder if there are sites you have to go to or if there are certain frequencies you can tune in to hear about.</UTT>That's something I'm definitely researching and intending to do. Did you listen to the podcast?</UTT>I haven't gotten to the podcast yet, but I'd like to. Do you have any suggestions where to begin?</UTT>I listen to a few podcasts about true crime and a few based on interviews. I recommend Stuff They Don't Teach You and 99.99% invisible. Have fun talking. Have a great day.</UTT>1

Good afternoon, who are you today?</UTT>Good for you and your asking?</UTT>Thank you very well, as of late I've heard of a few interesting factoids and would like to share some of them with you. You know that it is legal in South Africa for flame throwers to install on your car to help prevent carjacking.</UTT>Sounds cool, I'd like to mount some in my car for my daily commute to traffic lol.</UTT>That's funny, you have to live in a big city with lots of traffic. You know, McDonalds opened a drive through in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get their cars because of their uniforms.</UTT>That's nice of them. Sure it transformed the fast food industry. I wonder how Karl Benz, who invented the modern car, thinks of them using his invention.</UTT>I'm sure it will, I'll find no uniforms of any kind some day, too, I don't want to get out of my car and find the drive through much easier, there's something else supposed to test the time, no pun intended.</UTT>True, I redabbed somewhere that Google's self drive car has aggressive mode, that kind of sounds settled and nerved.</UTT>Yea that sounds scary. If you ask me, road rage is a whole new meaning. I wonder how it does in autobaun.</UTT>I heard Audi had to create a new horn to withstand constant use when they entered the Indian market. I can't even imagine. I definitely need that flamethrower. I lit them up.</UTT>Some days are too funny. Sure it gets easier than the other days, but I find it funny that people beat other players in the video game Gran Turismo and as a result become race car drivers.</UTT>He has some skills and that's a lot of people. I'm glad to be over the winter over here, I live in Ohio and your car isn't legal to warm up here. My yin has been freezing here lately.</UTT>So you can't warm up your car sitting running, turning on, or going back inside, you can't sit and warm up your car. That's crazy and totally understandable, but I can't sympathize in Florida, it's got to be below 65 degrees and it's freezing, so I can't imagine it being cold.</UTT>It's cold by all means. Glad you're somewhere warm my friend.</UTT>Thanks. I live in the north, but when the bones can take it, Iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</UTT>Wow, when I retired, I went south. I got too old for this. If I could get there sooner, I would be like that man in New York and find a lot of 'classic' cars worth millions in their barns.</UTT>I probably have a better chance of winning the lottery to get here quicker I spend a lot of time on the beach, I took an Amazon Kindle, I didn't worry about the sand on the page that way, I could get a lottery ticket.</UTT>I've read quite a bit. I find the new Amazon font Bookerly a breeze to read specifically designed for easy reading on kindles.</UTT>Do you know that Amazon's CEO built a clock on the mountain side that should run for more than 10,000 years?</UTT>Wow, that's interesting. Never heard of that before. Jeff Bezos is a billionaire, so I guess anything is possible.</UTT>I feel Amazon dabbles in most aspects of everyday life, including Sundays, because they have a contract with USPS to deliver the package during Sundays. That makes me happy for one who likes to get mail.</UTT>I've heard that before, but I never got a package Sunday. Anyway, nice to have a chat with you friends this afternoon. Get out and enjoy your Florida sunshine and know I'm jealous. Enjoy the rest of your day.</UTT>1

Hi, do you like comedy?</UTT>I do. You know Bill Murray thinks the Kung Fu Hustle show is the supreme achievement of the modern comedy age.</UTT>I love Bill Murray, but I'm not too sure what his opinion is on Kung-Fu Hustle. Have you seen that movie?</UTT>I don't see it, am I taking it for not being too good?</UTT>I don't think it's very funny. Do you know that Jack Black was the original part of the Green Lantern film?</UTT>I saw that. I think it was really fun for him.</UTT>I'm too. Do you know that Comedian Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989?</UTT>I don't know about that. Do you like 30rd Rock from the Sun?</UTT>I like it. I've seen it beat Seinfeld, Frazier and Friends once for the Golden Globes.</UTT>Yes, do you like to listen to albums? I started listening to them in the 70's but stopped when the cassette came along.</UTT>I love listening to albums. Lind Park's Hybrid Theory is the most sold album of the 21st century.</UTT>I always wonder what album has been the biggest sale since the turn of the century.</UTT>Two identical twins in Japan who released a rap album at the age of 100.</UTT>That's sweet. What a way to celebrate. NWA's album "Straight Outta Compton" reached platinum status first without support from airplay or major tours.</UTT>That's pretty cool, do you know much about the earth?</UTT>The Earth was formed 4 billion years ago.</UTT>Wow, that's been a long time ago. More than 80 percent of the forests on earth have been destoyed.</UTT>That's sad, by the end of the 21st century the Earth will be virtually free of helium. I bet Buck Rodgers won't see that coming.</UTT>That's scary, I wonder what the impact would be other than the balloons filling up.</UTT>I'm not sure what happened. The first time the Earth formed it was only 5.5 hours a day.</UTT>That was a very short day. Well, talk to you.</UTT>1

Good Morning, who are you? You just don't love the internet, right? It's actually addictive because of measurable brain changes.</UTT>I'm not sure Ii love it based on that little bit of information, but I'm not sure Iii can love it without the internet though.</UTT>It is very important. It carries a vast range of information from documents and applications, electronic mail and file sharing.</UTT>When I use the internet, I find that when I watch more videos than I really should, I am on youtube most often.</UTT>I love YouTube. It wasn't always so big, but it's sure bigger now, created back in 2005.</UTT>I guess the whole thing is having a demand video. I even find myself watching concerts on youtube.</UTT>Nice that I never watched a concert on youtube. I watched Justin Bieber's baby video on youtube and I don't like the most.</UTT>I suspect that has more to do with people being jealous of his popularity than they are of those individual videos (far worse than that I see).</UTT>True, I was surprised to hear that YouTube was the second largest search engine on the net. I wondered what Google was.</UTT>I assume you are right there. There seems to be little you can't find now on youtube. I just wonder how many cat videos are now uploaded on youtube.</UTT>Cat videos are definitely more popular than dogs. The police actually have their own "Blue Tube".</UTT>I've never heard of that one and it can't be that popular. I typically stick to music videos and concerts. The next best thing is YouTube because I rarely go to concerts.</UTT>A lot of fun at concerts. I prefer smaller concerts and nightclubs over big arenas or large parks. It is more intimate.</UTT>I totally agree. It would be nice if you got closer to the person or band you wanted to see rather than hundreds of feet away.</UTT>Exactly. An ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia still used as a concert venue. That's a cool place to see Croatia.</UTT>Some really cool places that the band has played in the past. I'm not sure how I feel about paying money to watch the hologram sing.</UTT>I probably don't want to pay that money either. I basically watch the concert on a screen. Ramon played 226 concerts total. They've been touring almost non stop for 20 years, maybe very tired.</UTT>That's a lot of shows, but it's not a hologram. You just have to press the repeat button and it keeps playing at night (after night) You can play at multiple places at once too.</UTT>That's a good point, I bet in future that will be more. Did you hear of Creed in 2002?</UTT>That's the one where people sue to get back their money. Creed could have just made a hologram of his best concert and replayed it.</UTT>It must be a bad concert. Not like the Ramones or Linkin Park. Great talk this morning.</UTT>Same here, I logged into youtube to see if I could find that Creed concert and see how bad it was. Good bye.</UTT>Definitely yes, have a good one.</UTT>1

It wasn't always so big, but it's sure bigger now, created back in 2005.</UTT>I guess the whole thing is having a demand video. I even find myself watching concerts on youtube.</UTT>I can't see a concert on youtube ever.</UTT>I suspect that has more to do with people being jealous of his popularity than they are of those individual videos (far worse than that I see).</UTT>True, I should have paid for my second largest youtube on the net, I wonder what the brain is of Google, I don't like youtube, it wasn't always, but surely it is now, created even in 2005.</UTT>I assume you are right there. There seems to be little you can't find now on youtube. I just wonder how many cat videos are now uploaded on youtube.</UTT>Cat videos are definitely more popular than dogs. The police actually have their own "Blue Tube".</UTT>I've never heard of that one and it can't be that popular. I usually stick to music videos and concerts.</UTT>A lot of fun at concerts. I prefer smaller concerts and nightclubs over big arenas or large parks. It is more intimate. The cat videos definitely aren't as popular as the dog ones. The police actually have their own "Blue Tube".</UTT>I totally agree. It would be nice if you got closer to the person or band you wanted to see rather than hundreds of feet away.</UTT>Exactly.</UTT>Some really cool places that the band has played in the past. I'm not sure how I feel about paying money to watch the hologram sing.</UTT>I probably don't want to pay that money either. I basically watch the concert on a screen. Ramon played 226 concerts total. They've been touring almost non stop for 20 years, maybe very tired.</UTT>That's a lot of shows, but it's not a hologram. You just have to press the repeat button and it keeps playing at night (after night) You can play at multiple places at once too.</UTT>That's a good point, I bet in future that will be more. Did you hear of Creed in 2002?</UTT>That's the one where people sue to get back their money. Creed could have just made a hologram of his best concert and replayed it.</UTT>It must be a bad concert. Not like the Ramones or Linkin Park. Great talk this morning.</UTT>Same here, I logged into youtube to see if I could find that Creed concert and see how bad it was. Good bye.</UTT>Definitely yes, have a good one.</UTT>0
I love working on my computer. I got my first computer back in the late 70s.</UTT>I got one sometime in the late 90's. I was in grade school and was excited to own one. Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer algorithm.</UTT>Ada does a lot. I'm lucky we never smoke, so it voided our mac war.</UTT>Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed software of the first Doom around the time my family got their first computer. I'm pretty sure I have 98 though.</UTT>Nice. Do you know that someone built a working computer once using a minecraft building block?</UTT>I don't know about that, that's very interesting. The first Google compute housed at Stanford is a custom made enclosure by Little Boots.</UTT>I love Lego, even the Russians make one out of water, I have no idea how.</UTT>I love Lego too, how did they accomplish that? I have to look into it, I actually learned that the CAPTCHA stands for something, a completely automated public tuning test to tell between computers and humans. That's a mouthful.</UTT>Wow, that's a mouthful. I could just upload it to my Mac in my mind, just like transhumanists want to do.</UTT>That helps me remember things. Radio is amazing technology too. There are radio stations that translate the sun's activity into sound so you can listen to its music.</UTT>That's cool. I was surprised to learn that Jupiter has a radio storm so loud you can pick it up on AM radio.</UTT>That's amazing, do you know that Bill Murray voiced the Phantom Four's "Human Torch" in the 1970s?</UTT>I've never heard that. I know soldiers made radios using razorblades and pencils, which was very creative during WWII.</UTT>That's extremely resourceful. The song "Hanson" became the most requested song by radio stations because the DJ didn't reveal the guy at Mmmbop.</UTT>Smart dj. I love going to a website where I can listen to old classic radio dramas for free. The world war was great.</UTT>Oh yeah, that's the one where late-night listeners think aliens are actually attacking the Earth, right?</UTT>That's the one. Big deal. Sounds a lot better than a finished Latin-language station.</UTT>Sorry, I mean listeners. You have to really believe it. Actually, one of the most popular radio acts of the 30's was a ventriloquist.</UTT>Is he a ventriloquist on the radio? I wonder if he is a Canadian? Their stations must have at least 40% Canadian music.</UTT>That fact even baffles contemporary critics. I'm a big fan of poetry and the 274-line poem is called "chaos" because the 800 English words are pronounced irregularly.</UTT>Wow, that's insane, that's a lot of words.</UTT>1

Hi, do you like to read?</UTT>Reading makes our brains active more.</UTT>Yup, sure you've ever gone to wikipedia?</UTT>Reading is a means of sharing information and ideas through language.</UTT>Yeah, they have the rank of a superhero by his power on wikipedia.</UTT>The reading process requires continued practice, development and note of the subject. It's easy to remember.</UTT>Do you know who wrote the oldest known cybord in fiction?</UTT>No, it's a good brain exercise and much reduces reading habits these days, please all on social media.</UTT>Have you read Starship Trooper?</UTT>Yes, it is very interesting.</UTT>Are you going to a concert?</UTT>The concert was live music performed in front of the audience.</UTT>Are you in any?</UTT>I went to Shakira. She did a very beautiful dance.</UTT>Nice. Do you know about ramones?</UTT>American brand of punk rock.</UTT>Yeah, do you know how many years they've been touring?</UTT>20 years could be.</UTT>And yeah, they had 223 concerts at that time.</UTT>It is very interesting.</UTT>Yeah, nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you? Have you seen Incredibles II?</UTT>Hello, I have. Have you seen the good sequel that came out in 2004?</UTT>I don't, but the choice of voice talent is interesting. The Incredibles director Brad Bird voices the superhero costume designer, Edna Mode, in a storyboard session after it can't be found. After the storyboard session, Brad Bird voices the superhero costume designer, Edna Mode.</UTT>Nice story. The girl playing the voice of the Violet is Sarah Vowell. She is also the author of historical fiction, which sells.</UTT>quite talented. The present day events of Incredibles are set in the 1960s. That was a great period in clothing and architecture.</UTT>I agree, I like to find vintage items from that era. When they make movies, the director uses artists he thinks are likely to quit and fire Disney. He also thinks that their motivation is to produce better work so they can save their jobs.</UTT>I guess that. He knows the quality. I also figure they invest a lot in scripts and casting because so much goes into animation.</UTT>Yes, I didn't actually realize that there was a sequel to The Incredibles: River of the Underminer that came out in video game form. Have you ever heard of that?</UTT>I'm not. I guess people just can't wait for the movie. When iron is hot, it strikes better than the market.</UTT>Yes, you ever had a nintendo back in the day, speaking of video games?</UTT>I don't. I played video games as a kid, but not the NES. I don't have time now.</UTT>I don't have time either. The original system could display only 54 colors.</UTT>All great concerns with NES play. It was finally discontinued in Japan in September 2003.</UTT>I lost interest in iii and time somewhere in the mid 90's. You know Ronald Reagan was once turned down for a movie role because he didn't fit the president's look. How ironic.</UTT>I wonder how the President looked back in those days. Maybe he needed better make up. LOL!</UTT>LOL, remember the science guy Bill Nye?</UTT>I do. He is great. A good ambassador for science.</UTT>Yes, he was discovered by winning a contest about being a Steve Martin lookalike.</UTT>That's great, the man has varied talents, I enjoy chattering with you anyway, have a good day.</UTT>Have a good day as well, it's a pleasure. One more quick question before we go. Would you like comedy any chance?</UTT>I like comedy, they are funny and I am funny, we got along very well.</UTT>Awesome, I love them too, have a great day.</UTT>1

I find the idea of the universe evolving by natural selection fascinating. I guess it refers to the idea of a multiverse that constantly percolates out of a new universe.</UTT>I think so. The universe is surely interesting.</UTT>I've seen dumbed down explanations of physicist's theories in pop science journals, where each of the new universes that pop out in a big bang or hole says it has its own well functioning law and bears it in a similar pattern.</UTT>Haha, sorry my last response was cut off early haha, but the universe is super interesting and I even saw a theory that we exist inside a black hole, I wonder how that even works.</UTT>Same, unfortunately my education in hard science lacks. I intend to read all the modern physics works that have been majorly popular (Wu Li Masters' dance, Tao of Physics, etc.) these days so I can at least get the supplement version of Sunday.</UTT>Haha that's a good idea, did you hear about the possibility of a parallel universe? There is a cold spot in the microwave background that scientists have detected in space and think there is a parallel universe. I wonder if I've ever met my parallel self?</UTT>Wild, I've never seen that. I love alternate history science fiction though. What do you do?</UTT>I like the alternate history stuff, I think it's very fascinating, how many times have you folded a piece of paper? The maximum amount of work anyone can do with it is apparently 103.</UTT>I never tried. I wonder if it depends on the size of the paper you started with.</UTT>I don't think so, I think it's just an overall rule. Have you ever played a video game before?</UTT>Long ago, the era of Pact Man and Space Invaders. To be honest, I have never seen an appeal. What do you suggest?</UTT>I used to play a lot of video games but I don't really play anymore. As a kid I played a lot of video games. For example, I played N64 Golden Eye. A lot of game developers appeared before that never even worked.</UTT>When was that?</UTT>I think it came out like 1997. I don't know if you ever played the N64, but it's a great system. Have you ever heard of Mortal Kombat?</UTT>I heard of them and vaguely recall the movie based on them.</UTT>Movies and a whole bunch of games. The first movie was good, but the second was horrible. I've never really played a game, it's very violent and that's why our current video game rating system is so.</UTT>Wow, I should have googled that. Reminds me of how the comic code came about in the 50's.</UTT>Yep, actually the same kind of idea, and I know Australia bans a lot of games, I think it's funny because Australia bans more games than even China.</UTT>I wonder how it is in the EU.</UTT>The EU also bans stuff, at least the sensor games, but not as bad as Australia. You've never been to a Chip-E-Cheese before.</UTT>There was never food there, I remember them calling themselves showbiz and having hillbilly bears.</UTT>1

Hello there, are you a fan of the nintendo system?</UTT>Hey, I had one about 30 years ago if I counted it. Are you?</UTT>That's what it is. I basically have my best friends as well who had one back then.</UTT>Have you ever had an atari?</UTT>No, but we're calling Ntelevision I think. The Ntelevision version is cheaper. What do you suggest?</UTT>I'm sure. The game is very simple but a lot of fun. An apparent Atari video game landfill. A documentary was made about it.</UTT>It was probably very interesting to watch that. I remember getting hours of fun from that older system with my brother and sister.</UTT>I don't know if the NFL is recognized as an entertainment business rather than a sport like WWE. I wonder why.</UTT>That's very interesting, I wonder why. Sounds kind of fishy to me, they control who wins or something.</UTT>Right, it's all staged like a wrestling. lol</UTT>EXACTLY. Man, I don't think certain fans (like Saints fans) want to hear something like that.</UTT>Nope, they sure don't want to hear that. Riots.</UTT>Yeah, people are trying to sue them for spending tickets, hotels or something like that.</UTT>I totally agree, have you ever watched a horror film, no single person involved in the Exorcist thought of a horror film, they thought they made it happen lol</UTT>I like to watch them, and it's really. That's just too funny. Yeah, I wonder what kind of movies they think they're doing.</UTT>They may think it's a documentary or something. Watching horror movies can be a lot of fun.</UTT>You can be right, and read how many calories you can burn just watching them?</UTT>I didn't. But that's a killer workout.</UTT>Yeah, just watched lol.</UTT>I've never seen Inception, but it's originally supposed to be a horror film.</UTT>That's crazy, that movie is just crazy in general. Well, it's nice to talk to you today and I hope you have a good day.</UTT>1

Do you like YouTube?</UTT>I'm quite a lot in it. My kids still like Psy's gangnam style videos. How weird.</UTT>What a great dance, lol. I heard that song almost broke YouTube.</UTT>Unfortunately, that's not something that can be believed, my daughter is also a fan of Justin Bieber, and sometimes I am not, so we'll argue about it while she watches.</UTT>LOL I didn't like that video when it came out, and I was with a lot of people because it was the most disliked video on youtube.</UTT>You're talking about Bieber's song "baby" either? I'm trying to find older albums on youtube. stuff like Linkin Park or reel big fish.</UTT>Yea, the song was terrible lol. I love Linkin Park and especially the hybrid theory.</UTT>I heard the 21st century album was the most sold. Have you listened to anything in particular?</UTT>Just rockin' and some rap here and there. Suggestions.</UTT>I'm trying to revisit some older rape groups. In my younger days, it was pretty square so I didn't listen much to it. The NWA's "Straight Outta Compton" show was a classic.</UTT>I love the NFA straight out. Nothing is better than a high school member bumping that back in the day. They went platinum lol.</UTT>Yeah, I don't know how well that album does. I used to like beatboxers. I always find that fascinating how they can create all those rhythms without them.</UTT>I'm sure I practiced that, got it decent, and sometimes busted it out at a party. Ever heard of Japanese twins who released albums at 100?</UTT>That sounds awesome, I must look that up. It seems significant in many cultures. I think rap is even pretty big in Korea.</UTT>I heard Korea rape and they have a complimenting battle over the rape. I would like to see the battle.</UTT>That sounds cool. Guess rap is a legitimate form of music. I know my dad hates rap, but hey, the Library of Congress seems to think it is a worthy form of art. You think they consider Tupac's music culturally significant?</UTT>That's a good feat of Tupac, making rap music significant lol My dad hates it too, you've ever watched Ritrats, Retar's "Busta Rhyme" voice.</UTT>That's really what that is, that's a dinosaur thing, kinda bad boy, P. Diddy's record label is named after that, isn't it? Sorry, I'm pretty square like I said.</UTT>Yea dinosaur, lol I think it was funny lol Bad boy record. How nice to chat with you.</UTT>Nice to chat to you as well. I'm going to look up some LL Cool J and run into DMC now. Take care.</UTT>I'm willing too, I love those rapists, enjoy your weekend.</UTT>1

Hey, what do you big Natalie Portman fans do?</UTT>Hi, I hope you do well Natalie Portman, I'm a huge fan of Natalie Portman, I'm even surprised that Raffey Cassidy upstaged her on Vox Lux, I've never even heard of a young actor. What about you?</UTT>I've never heard of her either. I'm sure she was good to upstage Natalie Portman. How cool is the Vox Lux? It's not a movie.</UTT>iii is a rated R, which I hear is disappointing. unfortunately they say it really has no energy to say anything interesting or anything really sensible.</UTT>Sure, listen to a lot of music by chance too. Who is in the concert downloading or buying an album?</UTT>Actually I love Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory. In fact it's the best selling album of the 21st century and I can see why. What about you?</UTT>It was a fun album. I definitely listened to it a lot in the mid 2000s and thought it was the first time it came out. The NWA was a great group too. The movie was really good.</UTT>I agree, you also know that the first album "Straight Out of Compton" hit platinum status despite no airplay support or major tours. That was really impressive.</UTT>Wow, the challenges they face, especially, are definitely impressive. reel big fish recorded all their hits for an album and I never knew people would like them that much. Do you like them?</UTT>I don't know if people like them either, I've never heard of them. You can still believe that Dark Side of the Moon was one of the best selling albums of 2014, though it was released over 40 years ago. That goes to show that music doesn't die.</UTT>Wow, that's crazy. I wonder if it won any of the other years in between. I wonder if Judd the Judge bought it with the money he made.</UTT>Ha, she can afford several albums that make $23,000 an episode, right? Crazy to think LeBron is the highest paid celebrity?</UTT>Wow, I really don't know that. LeBron is about to be crazy and happy to be a billionaire.</UTT>Indeed he deserves it. I wonder if he visited the secret room of Pixar, which celebrities often visit.</UTT>I too wish I could go see it. It would be cool to just see celebrities there haha.</UTT>I'm not kidding, I told you that the concert that Creed put on back in 2002 was something I'd like to see in person, and that was so godawful that a few fans who attended actually filed a lawsuit against him. I can't imagine a concert being that bad.</UTT>Haha I can't remember being in that bad of a concert. Pink Fluff playing an ancient Roman amphiteather in 1972 was wild.</UTT>It's agreed if it is. It's wild to see another band called the Ramones playing 223 grand concerts for 20 years almost without stopping.</UTT>Wow, I wonder how they get the energy to do all that lol.</UTT>That's a good question, they have to take a serious toll on themselves. Like Linkin Park, I wonder where they got the energy to play 324 concerts in 2001 in a single year. Of course, their debut album will be successful, so they might be motivated to play.</UTT>Wow, that's nuts, I took off because I had a great chat with you, take care.</UTT>1
Hey, what do you big Natalie Portman fans do?</UTT>Hi, I hope you do well Natalie Portman, I'm a huge fan of Natalie Portman, I'm even surprised that Raffey Cassidy upstaged her on Vox Lux, I've never even heard of a young actor. What about you?</UTT>I've never heard of her either. I'm sure she was good to upstage Natalie Portman. Not a movie.</UTT>iii is a rated R, which I hear is disappointing. unfortunately they say it really has no energy to say anything interesting or anything really sensible.</UTT>Sure, you can listen to a lot of music by chance too.</UTT>Actually I love Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory. In fact it's the best selling album of the 21st century and I can see why.</UTT>It was a fun album. I definitely listened to it a lot in the mid 2000s and thought it was the first time it came out. The NWA was a great group too. The movie was really good.</UTT>I agree, you also know that the first album "Straight Out of Compton" hit platinum status despite no airplay support or major tours. That was really impressive.</UTT>Wow, the challenges they face, especially, are definitely impressive. reel big fish recorded all their hits for an album and I never knew people would like them that much. Do you like them?</UTT>I don't know if people like them either, I've never heard of them. You can still believe that Dark Side of the Moon was one of the best selling albums of 2014, though it was released over 40 years ago.

Hello there, do you like Netflix?</UTT>Hi, I love NFC, I wonder if they have a new TV show called Grownish?</UTT>I actually don't know, but it is such a convenience nowadays. Do you know how it came about?</UTT>I believe they are a rental service, and then the streaming content expands.</UTT>Yeah, the founders are mad that they have to pay late fees at Blockbuster.</UTT>Oh yes, I remember that story, I heard it on my telephone radio one day while driving in my car.</UTT>Nice. You know Blockbuster can buy it back then, not buy it.</UTT>I heard that and several offers were declined. Silly choice. Now Netflix is worth $2 billion.</UTT>That's true, but they still spend more on postage than bandwidth.</UTT>That's just crazy, but things aren't crazy these days, like two old phone books can't be separated, and a bit of trivia.</UTT>That's actually quite funny. Have you ever used a rotary phone?</UTT>I actually used rotary phones when I was growing up. I'm so happy they have new technology.</UTT>Yeah sure they got the area code 212 in NY.</UTT>Cool, I don't know about that one, I find it still fascinating that we can talk to each other through wire-transmitted electronic signals (what a weird thing to think of it really).</UTT>It is indeed, and those miles of cable are on the bottom of the ocean.</UTT>I heard that because the telephone was so awesome. I remember one day when people said we could see each other while talking on the phone, we laughed about it. I never thought about it.</UTT>We sure have come a long way. When we don't use the phone, UNICEF donates clean water.</UTT>That's amazing. I need to check that NFC has a spin off show coming out lately, and I want to see A Difference World and so many others.</UTT>Yeah there's a lot to see really there. Do you have Adnroid or iPhone?</UTT>I only use Android. I don't try phones and the cars are better, I'd rather put too much money into the phones and save money.</UTT>I'm gonna chat with you nicely.</UTT>1

Do you know much about the planet?</UTT>I do. Do you know that Jupiter has a moon in orbit of the sun on the planet?</UTT>That's Ganymede and pretty cool.</UTT>Yeah, do you know that Venus doesn't tilt?</UTT>And that's why it has any season now.</UTT>And it also rotates only clockwise.</UTT>Yeah, another planet where glass shards rain.</UTT>And that's 4500 mph at 2000 degrees Celsius.</UTT>Yeah, you know they found the building blocks of life on another planet?</UTT>And that's really some 455 light years here.</UTT>Yeah, do you know that Uranus rotates sideways?</UTT>And it rolls instead of rotating around the sun.</UTT>Yeah, like reading?</UTT>I actually love it a lot, you?</UTT>I'm too. Have you read about the starship troopers?</UTT>And it is good. The military branch should also have it.</UTT>Yeah, the game is the same as Ender. The military loves that too.</UTT>Right. Do you know who holds the speed reading record?</UTT>That's 4700 words per minute, Anne Jones.</UTT>Yeah, you know, in the 18th century, people were in moral panic over reading a novel?</UTT>And for the opposite reason, we have the opposite panic now.</UTT>Yeah, sad. Do you know Tolkien and CS Lewis?</UTT>1

Hello, are you politically interested at all?</UTT>Yes, to a certain degree, I am. You are. It's all kind of driving me nuts lately, but somehow it can survive.</UTT>I'm trying to find humor in it. It's a joy not to have Trump among the 3 richest presidents of all time, for example.</UTT>What is that insane how can that be? I think he's a super filthy rich good guy.</UTT>I'm sure they measure inflation. Anyways, I think other presidents seem to have other priorities than politics, like Indonesian Presidents released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Now that's sure hilarious, Trump should have done the same, and he could have finally made more money and ranked among the top 3 richest presidents. Do you use Facebook at all?</UTT>Ah, I'm sure people would rather not sing with him ever, and I do. Why did you ask?</UTT>I just read about Facebook. I was interested in Myspace turning down an offer to buy it. I'm sure they regret it. I don't use facebook because I lack friends. I'm sure they know that the website will become huge or flop.</UTT>Oh, that's interesting, now look at how far they come. It's interesting that other companies are doing the opposite and going against Facebook instead of engaging with them. I remember Burner King promoting the free Whopper by unfriending 10 people.</UTT>Haha, what's that about? Burger Kind has an agenda yeah, it's interesting to see how Facebook ends up, I never thought I'd see Myspace end.</UTT>I wonder if we've ever seen Facebook end. A lot of places don't see it too favorably. For some reason Facebook like buttons are illegal in parts of Germany.</UTT>Wow, that may have caused them to add other options, I believe at least I noticed a smiling face instead of a similar one, I just found out Mark Zimmerberg made Facebook blue because he suffered from red-green blindness. Crazy!</UTT>I don't know why Facebook is blue, I'm sure other colorblind folks appreciate it too. True, Facebook has become even bigger in other areas, and I've heard that Island is actually rewriting its constitution and using it to get the public to suggest.</UTT>Oh wow, I don't like that I have to join just to suggest, but I'm sure they have other means to get suggestions (at least I hope they do) I actually appreciate the blue as well, I don't use facebook, just appreciate it. Time flies.</UTT>Wow, the time really does fly. I guess Facebook came right before youtube in 2005. Now both are so old. Are you a big fan too?</UTT>Oh I love YouTube, what a great website, you can learn there, create videos to teach others, and at the same time earn some advertising revenue. A truly great website.</UTT>I think it's very useful too. It's especially inspiring to things like a youtube like site for police to share law enforcement videos.</UTT>Oh, I heard about BlueTube, I mean check out the company, youtube is huge, wow, the second largest search engine I have ever seen. It's easy to believe, I've always watched the publications.</UTT>Crazy how big sites leave their mark on the Internet (I think Netflix and YouTube combine half the peak traffic in North America).</UTT>Two of my favorite websites I use both at the same time sometimes (fun fact) Justin Beer baby videos on youtube are the most disliked.</UTT>See, even though youtube is still a positive influence, it still inspires a lot of hate. I guess you have to see what's best for both sides. It would be very nice if you had a great night's chat anyways.</UTT>I agree, people can be pretty mean sometimes, ditto. Wonderful to chat with you as well.</UTT>Hahaha, absolutely take care of yourself.</UTT>1

Hello, have you traveled much?</UTT>I like traveling, and I plan to take a month vacation in Las Vegas, NV in March, right?</UTT>Oh that sounds fun. I tried as much as I could. Have you ever visited Japan?</UTT>Wow, I've never visited Japan now, what's your concern? I feel a little nervous thinking about riding a plane that far.</UTT>I actually have, but I didn't know I would pay the toll $300 if I traveled to the country by car until now.</UTT>Wow, you said one can get to Japan by car if it takes an hour and a day to get there?</UTT>You can get a car across by large ship, I just refer to car travel around the country, but yeah, I wonder how long it takes to get a car shipped there.</UTT>You mentioned traveling across the country for at least $300 before. One day I made sure to take a lot of extra money with me, hoping to visit Japan.</UTT>Sure do that, and if you go to island make sure you rent a car there or just fly a lot.</UTT>You know the Netherlands created a commuter bus designed to travel 160 mph (I don't think I want to travel on a bus with that speed king).</UTT>I actually want to try that. Do you know the first King to travel the world?</UTT>If I was right, the first name of the King would be Kalakaua. I don't know of a King in Hawaii. I guess I never thought about it.</UTT>I'm not, but he's so cool. Do you watch much TV?</UTT>I watch TV in the living room and sometimes when I'm not working or lying in bed. I try to watch the news every night.</UTT>Oh cool, have you ever watched a show like Simpsons?</UTT>I've watched Simpson and other shows like Flintstones and Dad.</UTT>Nice. Do you know of an episode where Bart didn't appear and wasn't mentioned?</UTT>I don't know about that. Do you know that dogs have 12 different types of blood and donate blood to other dogs?</UTT>That's so cool, they have a vending machine in Istanbul where you put a plastic bottle and then it dispenses food and water to dogs.</UTT>Wow, I don't know that. Do you know that the only two animals that understand the point are the dog and elephant?</UTT>That's a lot nice to say about their intelligence, I assume. Nice to chat.</UTT>1

Hello, how do you do? James Wang Howe of China was a pioneer in using wide angle lenses, low key lighting, crab dolly, deep focus cinematography. Until 1943, he was not an American citizen and married a white woman illegally.</UTT>That's interesting, women have never been nominated for the Oscar for best cinematography.</UTT>Stanley Kubrick took the camera away from him and did it, but Spartacus cinematographers have cinematographers, but they took it away and did it for him, which isn't almost one of the work.</UTT>Too funny. Cinematographer Roger Deakins has been nominated for the best Oscar 13 times and never won.</UTT>Wow, that's tough. Gavin Free, known for his rooster teeth and his youtube achievement hunter, also works in slow motion cinematography for hot fuzz, Sherlock Holmes A Game of Sharks and Dredd.</UTT>Cinematographer Roger Deakins has been nominated for the best Oscar 13 times and has never won.</UTT>I think you just told me that. He's too bad. How apart is he?</UTT>I'm not sure. Movies are your favorite form of entertainment. An activity that holds the attention and interest of the audience or gives pleasure and delight.</UTT>I've watched a lot of movies. When he visited Britain around 1950, Caesar noted that British people breed chickens for food rather than entertainment.</UTT>That's interesting. Science guy Bill Nye got a break from entertaining by winning a contest that looked like Steve Martin.</UTT>He really looks like Steve Martin. The Nintendo entertainment system was finally discontinued in Japan in July 2003.</UTT>Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performances exist in all cultures.</UTT>Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because the entertainment executives didn't think he had that presidential look.</UTT>Hahaha guess he showed executives. Storytelling, music, drama, dancing, and different kinds of performances exist in all cultures.</UTT>That's interesting.</UTT>Most forms are recognized and familiar, but different things hold people's attention, because individuals prefer entertainment.</UTT>Cool, the Nintendo entertainment system can display only 54 colors.</UTT>I don't know about that. Early forms of entertainment are supported in royal courts.</UTT>Nice. Do you like animals? About 2 billion individual animals on earth.</UTT>That's amazing. There are 1 million living species, but 1 million are insects.</UTT>Nice to talk to you.</UTT>1

I'm not a Facebook fan. Suggestions. Amazing how it has grown since it's origin in 2004.</UTT>I've been on and off there on and off since it was founded in 2004 like that, but I'm not pretty different from facebook.</UTT>I'm also not a fan of the founders, are you?</UTT>I don't like his philosophy of removing anonymous from the internet or letting 13 year olds have a facebook profile.</UTT>I suppose it's a legal maneuver. Funny you rarely hear of other cofounders.</UTT>Saverin, McCollum, Moskovitz and Hughes made a movie about Facebook that said "disagreed" and I heard at least one of them screwed over by Zapperburg.</UTT>And sheeplike people still trust that they can share their personal information on Facebook without any concern. I wonder how many of the founders graduated because they started out as students at Harvard.</UTT>I don't know, but Facebook is worth 10 trillion dollars now, so I guess it doesn't matter too much.</UTT>Right, sorry Mo, but here's a house for him. Today, Facebook made most of their money from advertising and screwed the election. LOL</UTT>It's bad MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook, I liked them a lot in high school.</UTT>My dog has a page on MtSpace. You may be a friend of Myspace. My dog appears not to help them earn enough money to afford to write a check for $75 million.</UTT>Dogs may have legal rights guaranteed by the constitution in Germany.</UTT>The German Shepherd is a strong lobbying dog in Germany. But this does not explain how protected species status is granted to the Loch Ness monster. But there are a lot of monsters in politics.</UTT>A lot of insects are in politics too, and there are 1 million species of insects.</UTT>Politicians are all animals. There are 2 billion species of animals on earth and most of them live in my back yard.</UTT>I only really care about domesticated ones on the forehead, so I guess if they don't have white patches on the forehead, I wouldn't care.</UTT>I have a cat named Spot because it has a white spot on the face, but it's far domesticated. Another holdover from evolution must be a hiccup.</UTT>I wonder why people say they drink water when you have a hiccup, so it has something to do with the use of having a gill.</UTT>Right. The guitarist of the Muse who holled the record with more guitar smashes than anyone else on tour was another evolution quandry.</UTT>Matthew Bellamy That's a pretty cool world record.</UTT>Sure, I wonder if Bellamy ever set a speaker on fire like Eddie Van Halen when he recorded a solo for beat-it?</UTT>I don't know. They should both team up with Brain May and find something crazy to do with knowing astrophysics.</UTT>Where are all the normal guitarists these days? They could all be held hostage in the floating recorn studio Pink Fluff has on the Thames.</UTT>LOL, well, nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

I wonder how many of the founders graduated because they started out as students at Harvard.</UTT>I don't know, but Facebook is worth 10 trillion dollars now, so I guess it doesn't matter too much.</UTT>Right, sorry Mo, but here's a house for him. Today, Facebook made most of their money from advertising and screwed the election. LOL</UTT>It's bad MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook, I liked them a lot in high school.</UTT>My dog has a page on MtSpace. You may be a friend of Myspace. My dog appears not to help them earn enough money to afford to write a check for $75 million.</UTT>Dogs may have legal rights guaranteed by the constitution in Germany.</UTT>The German Shepherd is a strong lobbying dog in Germany. But this does not explain how protected species status is granted to the Loch Ness monster. But there are a lot of monsters in politics.</UTT>And a lot of insects are in politics too.</UTT>Politicians are all animals. There are 2 billion species of animals on earth and most of them live in my back yard.</UTT>Only because I really care about domesticated ones with the forehead.</UTT>I have a cat named Spot because it has a white spot on the face, but it's far domesticated. Another holdover from evolution must be a hiccup.</UTT>I wonder why people say they drink water when you have a hiccup, so</UTT>Right. The guitarist of the Muse who holled the record with more guitar smashes than anyone else on tour was another evolution quandry.</UTT>Matthew Bellamy That's a pretty cool world record.</UTT>Sure, I wonder if Bellamy ever set a speaker on fire like Eddie Van Halen when he recorded a solo for beat-it?</UTT>I don't know. They should both team up with Brain May and find something crazy to do with knowing astrophysics.</UTT>Where are all the normal guitarists these days?</UTT>LOL, well, nice to chat with you.</UTT>0
Well, that's weird. My article just switched to basketball.</UTT>My things have always been. You see it in the comparison of Judge Jude and Lebron.</UTT>Yes, but considering the size of the syndicate area here, it makes sense to do it.</UTT>Yep, Lebron certainly deserves to be paid.</UTT>The complainants about their salary don't take into account how many people can watch them and how much money the networks and teams make of their talent.</UTT>Exactly. What is a multiplier? I started a company that sold directory assistance calls for less than 25 cents apiece at AT&T. But we sell such over 500,000 calls a month.</UTT>My dad was a Yorkie before he was born. I never understood why this concept didn't sink in with some people. These people deserve it. Lebron James' high school basketball game attracted 1750 attendees. Tickets cost anywhere from $100 to $200.</UTT>I agree. Life is a challenge to finding an enterprise that gives one the benefit of a multiplier product. Jordan was smart enough to turn down $1 million for shoes and later receive 90 million from another company.</UTT>Lebron James, he was so successful because he understood this meant he was worth it.</UTT>I don't doubt it. I suppose he might have agents helping with that strategy. Notice the US Supreme Court has a top floor basketball court known as the highest court on the land.</UTT>That's funny. The New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed after them for being high-brow black.</UTT>I really wonder how that name came from. The dunk was also banned for 10 years. I think it would take that long to figure it out by building an unshattering backboard.</UTT>It's a joke to refer to their famous rugby team the All Blacks.</UTT>I see, that is somewhat relieved. I agree that football or basketball coaches get high pay. They bring in revenue.</UTT>I think anyone who contributes to a successful team should be paid very well.</UTT>Back it to that multiplier: How much revenue does sport bring and how much less with a bad coach?</UTT>And that's why the bad coaches get fired very quickly.</UTT>Sure it is. Simple economics. A few of us work in so visible jobs where we make financial contributions.</UTT>This is a bad stat, but the state's highest employee is the college football or basketball coach in 39 of 50 states.</UTT>I read that. I think the stats are OK. The governor of the state has no impact on income like the coach did. Iii was originally from Oklahoma and our college football was pretty important.</UTT>Depends on state. I'm from NY, but live in NY now. It's not that important here.</UTT>I understand that, panda called well, nice talk to you.</UTT>1

Hi, do you not like baseball?</UTT>We can talk baseball, who are your teams?</UTT>I don't have a specific team. Suggestions.</UTT>Yeah, I like rockies either because they are close and fun to see.</UTT>Very cool. Do you know why managers wear uniforms?</UTT>Yeah, I saw that, crazy, can you imagine them playing?</UTT>Yes, I think it's odd they always wear uniforms, but it makes sense now because they can play.</UTT>Kickball is also called baseball soccer in Canada. Kids love it.</UTT>I used to love kickball. It makes sense to mix that sport with kickball, but just keeping one word is easier.</UTT>Yeah, it's always fun. Is baseball so popular in Japan that it's surprising many fans discover its status as a national pastime for America?</UTT>I wonder why they are surprised it is popular here. America's past times have been favorites.</UTT>Yeah they're crazy about baseball. They'll head there in May.</UTT>That is very exciting, you can watch the game, do you know who's scheduling it?</UTT>I might have to introduce them to kickball. What is the game schedule?</UTT>ii) It was a married couple who had been married for 24 years up to 2005.</UTT>Now, some lonely people are probably.</UTT>hahaha probably. I wonder if that position is so remote you don't need to go into office.</UTT>That's the only way you or I would do it. Who won the world series? I don't remember.</UTT>I'm not sure who won the most recent world series.</UTT>Is the Women's World Cup higher than the US World Series?</UTT>I heard that. I was a little surprised.</UTT>Pretty bad if you're a cub fan, and when your team won the last series of world series, the ottoman empire still existed.</UTT>That was so long ago. I went to try to find out who won the last world series. Nice to talk to you.</UTT>1

Have you ever shoped at Target?</UTT>I shop at Target. If you ask me, there seem to be nicer stores than WalMart.</UTT>I agree. Do you know they match the price to Amazon?</UTT>I suppose they have to these days. Amazon is everywhere at any time. Target really needs competition.</UTT>It's a good idea. Also, do you know there are no Target stores in VT?</UTT>I wonder what is special about Vermont. It's law or something. It's right at the door to New Hampshire. Hmm, Target doesn't carry tobacco either.</UTT>That's a good question. I don't know if they sell tobacco, I wonder how many cases that is.</UTT>It's been 20 years or so, but I wonder what would stop sales. Tobacco is money. They may want to have a friendly and safe image.</UTT>I'm sure that's why. I also heard that the state senators have to work for Target also to make enough money.</UTT>I guess state senators aren't really well paid. But why Target? There aren't any better jobs out there.</UTT>You think so? Flexibility?</UTT>I guess seasonal work and flexible hours. Target stopped selling tobacco, but herbal supplements. Talk about bogus products.</UTT>Yeah, I don't believe in holistic medicine, off topic, but you watch a lot of TV. I watch a whole lot.</UTT>Sometimes when I'm in the gym i watch box. Try to catch up on the news and stuff.</UTT>Are you a fan of The Simpsons?</UTT>I enjoyed the first 8 seasons, I didn't find myself interested in recent stuff, the show ran its course, you?</UTT>I didn't see it long ago, but I used to watch it. Do you know that there was only one episode where Bart didn't appear and wasn't mentioned?</UTT>The show is really about Bart and his hijinks. I think it's funny that that 70's show was verbatim remade in the UK and flopped. I think something about the cast didn't work.</UTT>That's rare, the only thing I can think of doing really is The Office. Happened to you to see the Family Guy episode of South Park?</UTT>I did. It was a good episode when a manatee was fetching a ball to make up a story line.</UTT>It's hilarious. After that episode was aired, the Simpsons crew sent flowers to the South Park office, which they found very funny.</UTT>1

Hi, do you know much about cars?</UTT>I know a little bit about them. I know I love driving and would rather not have to walk if I could help. What do you do?</UTT>Haha, I'm like you. I was surprised to learn that Karl Benz was the first to issue a patent in 1886.</UTT>Really, that's what I'm hearing. Estimates are that there will be over 15 billion cars in 2014. I wonder how many more cars are now.</UTT>Holy smoke, I wonder if Karl Benz ever wondered about that many cars as he developed them.</UTT>Yeah, I bet he never imagined we would have that many cars. A shocking number, sure. You know it's legal in South Africa to have flame throwers in your car.</UTT>I don't know that. Yikes, what did they do to them?</UTT>Ha! I assume they are used in road rage situations but they say they are used to prevent carjacking.</UTT>If they had to put that in their car to prevent that, that sounds scary living there. The first Ford built a Model T in 1908 I saw at the parade.</UTT>Just sounds cool, I'm sure I've seen one before. Janet Marshenborough became a race car driver by beating 90,000 people in a video game called "Gran Turismo". I used to love it.</UTT>That's interesting, I wonder if that's part of the contest or something. I didn't realize McDonalds didn't have a drive thru until 1975.</UTT>Yeah, I heard they then added a throttle to the drive so the fatigued soldiers wouldn't have to get out of their car because it wasn't allowed.</UTT>Yes, do you know that the back of the car has become known as the trunk?</UTT>Nope, I never thought about it, did I?</UTT>That's what it was called, because people carried a trunk of wood in the back of the car in the early days of the day.</UTT>hardly sounds like one's belongings are very safe from that. but hey, if they can do that back then, hey, I'll get it. do you have a dog?</UTT>I have a dog. Do you know they aren't color blind?</UTT>I don't. I always thought they were. Do they see the color?</UTT>They just can't see as much difference in colour as humans. I'd have to be ready to wrap things up in the evening. Enjoy the chat.</UTT>Wow, interesting, I'd have to get to go too. Have a great night!</UTT>Have a great night too!</UTT>1

Hey, you're watching the drama there?</UTT>I watch it occasionally, but I'm a huge fantasy fan. I'd like to watch it with the kids in Mary and the Witch's Flower.</UTT>Nice. Do you know people draft fantasy national spelling bees?</UTT>I can see that. Sounds like you don't get much money out of that though. At that point, the actors were paid instead.</UTT>True, do you know that there is a fantasy congress also?</UTT>That sounds very boring. I would rather shoot myself than do that.</UTT>I guess it's people who enjoy it. Do you know that there is a single fold in the brain that makes fantasy different from reality?</UTT>I looked this up after watching the matrix. It was very interesting.</UTT>How amazing. Have you ever watched "The House"?</UTT>No, I prefer to read a 15145 page fantasy manuscript written by a Chicagojanitor.</UTT>Amazing how he did that.</UTT>Well, to write it took him six years. I don't even know how he could dedicate such time to doing it.</UTT>EXACTLY. Do you know Michael Cane?</UTT>I don't know Michael Caine. I know Michael Scott.</UTT>Caine. He appears to have become an actor because all the pretty girls are in drama classes.</UTT>I don't understand.</UTT>Do you know Jon Hamm?</UTT>I'm not sure about that guy. I know of famous people like Spielberg.</UTT>He's an actor and used to be a drama teacher. Do you know Ellie Kaiser?</UTT>I love Ellie Kaiser, she is beautiful.</UTT>She's really funny, nice chat.</UTT>1

Do you own a car?</UTT>I do. It's hard to find public transport in our area.</UTT>Here's the same as living in rural, finer, finer, no cadillacs?</UTT>No, I heard the company Cameron was named for the French explorer who founded Detroit.</UTT>That's right, I'm glad they're just stuck with Cadillac.</UTT>I know, he's his entire name is so hard to pronounce, right?</UTT>Sure, there isn't a very good roll of the tongue, you know in South Africa you can equip your car with a flamethrower.</UTT>I know, it is illegal in the US.</UTT>I'm sure I bet the danger is very. I need flame throwers to warm up my car in this cold weather.</UTT>Where are you from? Part of the US east coast. It's warming in Texas. Do you know why McDonalds added the first drive through?</UTT>Isn't Iowa so cold here? Did they add it to make it easy to obtain food in a lazy manner?</UTT>You're funny. It was to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their car wearing their uniforms.</UTT>That's some nice respect, that probably helps make a profit around military bases.</UTT>Most businesses think before they think about their customers. I'm sure McDonalds just wants to be more profitable.</UTT>Very good point. Do you know why they call it a trunk? lol</UTT>Because the old cars used to have a wood trunk on the back.</UTT>LOL, you're pretty easy to go there. I wonder how easy it was to steal someone's trunk early in the day.</UTT>It should be really easy, have you heard someone become a professional race car driver because they beat 90000 people in a video game called "Gran Turismo"?</UTT>I used to love playing that game. I can't imagine playing anyone 90000 times, but in the end it paid off for that guy. Who is his name?</UTT>Janet Marshenborough. Have you heard of this name before?</UTT>I've never heard that name. I googled him. How nice of you to chat to you.</UTT>Nice to chat with you too.</UTT>1

I used to always collect baseball cards as a kid. I heard men found a $300 million baseball card in his grandfather's attic in the 1900s. Have you ever collected one baseball card?</UTT>That's cool, unfortunately I've never collected a baseball card. What about you?</UTT>I love baseball so none of it is worth any crazy money, yes. Have you watched baseball at all?</UTT>I've been watching some games. I've somewhere read that managers wear uniforms because they can technically play for their teams should the need arise. How wild is that?</UTT>Yeah baseball has some weird rules. I think it's because the sport is so old. My dad's favorite team was the Cup and started in 1876. They also had one of the longest droughts ever, which 108 years.</UTT>Atlanta Braves - I'm for them, too. They've been around as long as the Cups, too. Both were founded in the same year the Little Bighorn fought. Wow!</UTT>Both of those teams have so much fandom. My dad said over 5 million people celebrated on the streets when the Cubs won in 2016. Have you heard of the curse of the Cubs?</UTT>Actually, it was pretty funny. It started in 1945 when stadium security didn't let Billy Sianis stay with his pet smelly goat in the stadium.</UTT>Watching world series is the best part of baseball. I remember the Red Sox coming back and beating the Yankees by a 3rd. How it's been going since 1903 is crazy.</UTT>I think it's still pretty popular. You know it's so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's status as an American national pastime.</UTT>I don't know because my friend told me that the women's World Cup is rated higher on TV than the world series.</UTT>I think soccer is the rule worldwide, but baseball is still pretty popular too. I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada. That's kinda strange.</UTT>Strangely, I heard the cub employed a pitcher with six fingers. I don't know why my dad likes that team.</UTT>They have a pitcher with 4,5 fingers and 6 fingers in his hand. Not common, but totally true.</UTT>Another weird thing about cubs. The ottoman empire still goes when it wins last time. Do you really think cubs are cursed?</UTT>I don't know about the curse, their luck is probably just bad.</UTT>They started out so well, they were the first team to win back to back. Kind of weird, so baseball can be fixed.</UTT>I said that before. You know, great Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end the 7th game and lose the 1926 World Series by downing his team in one run.</UTT>Even if it was fixed, people wouldn't care. They still want to watch it. A couple of games were scheduled for 2005, 2430.</UTT>I heard they've been doing that for 24 years, so they're very organized to keep all that schedule straight.</UTT>Baseball is a fun sport I like to see baseball live have you ever seen baseball?</UTT>I've seen many baseball games in my lifetime, I still love it as much as I did when I was a kid, well, chatting with you is nice, I need to get it to work, I'll talk to you later.</UTT>1
I used to always collect baseball cards as a kid. I heard men found a $300 million baseball card in his grandfather's attic in the 1900s. Have you ever collected one baseball card?</UTT>That's cool, unfortunately I've never collected a baseball card. What about you?</UTT>I love baseball so none of it is worth any crazy money but yes.</UTT>I've been watching some games. I've somewhere read that managers wear uniforms because they can technically play for their teams should the need arise. How wild is that?</UTT>Yeah baseball has some weird rules. I think it's because the sport is so old. My dad's favorite team was the Cup and started in 1876. They also had one of the longest droughts ever, which 108 years.</UTT>Atlanta Braves - I'm for them, too. They've been around as long as the Cups, too. Both were founded in the same year the Little Bighorn fought. Wow!</UTT>Both of those teams have so much fandom. My dad said over 5 million people celebrated on the streets when the Cubs won in 2016. Have you heard of the curse of the Cubs?</UTT>Actually, it was pretty funny. It started in 1945 when stadium security didn't let Billy Sianis stay with his pet smelly goat in the stadium.</UTT>Watching world series is the best part of baseball. I remember the Red Sox coming back and beating the Yankees by a 3rd. How it's been going since 1903 is crazy.</UTT>I think it's still pretty popular. You know it's so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's status as an American national pastime.</UTT>I don't know because my friend told me that the women's World Cup is rated higher on TV than the world series.</UTT>I think soccer is the rule worldwide, but baseball is still pretty popular too. I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada. That's kinda strange.</UTT>Strangely, I heard the cub employed a pitcher with six fingers. I don't know why my dad likes that team.</UTT>They have a pitcher with 4,5 and 6 fingers on his hand, not common, but totally true. Atlanta Braves aren't my favorite team, too. Both were founded in the same year the Little Bighorn fought. Wow!</UTT>Another weird thing about cubs.</UTT>You don't know love, and their luck is probably just bad.</UTT>They started out so well, they were the first team to win back to back.</UTT>I said that before. You know, great Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end the 7th game and lose the 1926 World Series by downing his team in one run.</UTT>Even if it was fixed, people wouldn't care. They still want to watch it. A couple of games were scheduled for 2005, 2430.</UTT>I wanted them to do last for 24 years, so they were very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,</UTT>Baseball is a fun sport I like to see baseball live.</UTT>I've seen many baseball games in my lifetime, I still love it as much as I did when I was a kid, well, chatting with you is nice, I need to get it to work, I'll talk to you later.</UTT>0
Have you heard of a history teacher in Florida who had students help drown raccoons in class?</UTT>Yes, that has to traumatize the kid and be against the law too.</UTT>I'm sure there was trauma for a student who shot a video broadcast for an Orlando television station. A 34 year teaching teacher in Orlando, FL.</UTT>I can understand why raccoons are a problem. They killed chickens. But obviously he traps them. He should have taken them from many miles away in the woods.</UTT>Exactly, in my rural northeastern area we do that. Most people understand that raccoons can be pests.</UTT>Apparently the law allows for humane euthanasia but I don't know if the method is considered humane.</UTT>Relocating animals is certainly humane if possible. You just can't imagine the range of comments brought out on Facebook by this event.</UTT>I'm sure it's going viral. You know the Facebook color scheme is largely blue because the founders are red-green blind.</UTT>It's a shame that Zapperberg can't see green, he has a lot of green that most of us have never seen.</UTT>True, but we don't have to testify before Congress either. Sure, Facebook began being humble when it started in a few colleges.</UTT>Absolutely. Launched in 2004. I believe in 2006 or 2007 or the public offer in 2012. That is a fast growing industry.</UTT>I love that the Americans continue to create such values as that, Google and Amazon. Facebook had 2 billion active users last year.</UTT>I don't know about that. I began to become wary of these new giants in the age of information. Facebook surged an eon ahead of the face book in collegiate directories, did it?</UTT>Yes, Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million, Blockbuster also turned down an offer to buy NFC for $5 million. Now there are two potential buyers going, and they are nearly going.</UTT>I'm somebody out there who rued today that they decided not to purchase Facebook in 2005.</UTT>No doubt. I wish I could relive 2008 over and get my money into the stock market before it crashed. I read that like buttons are illegal in one German state.</UTT>Sorry for your financial losses, you can't like in any way, some restrictions by Germany may make sense.</UTT>I just said it to demonstrate that many people regret finances. Do you know that seahorses are only neck-tight fish?</UTT>Funky. All the trout, bass and catfish I believe are olfactory considered are the only fish I know well of. No digited limbs.</UTT>All of that is fresh water fish, they drink water through their skin rather than their mouth.</UTT>Yes, I never fish in the ocean, but I would love to catch small sharks and prepare meals with them on the right deck. Saltwater fish like sharks drink from the gills and mouth too, I want to put a tasty shark on it, tell me it's delicious.</UTT>My problem is fishing in the deep seas, I would like to be in control. Now, when I want to go to the shore, I want to be immortal. I guess those who say that don't know the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy increases. Means that all particles in the universe will be moved randomly someday.</UTT>A lot has already moved randomly in my universe as far as I can see. I hope that course can be corrected in the 2020 election. Good to speak to you. Thanks</UTT>Like. Bye.</UTT>1

Hi.</UTT>Hi, you can imagine that the US does not charge income taxes like Monaco does.</UTT>That's crazy. Knowing that 86 percent of Nevada is owned by the government is crazy.</UTT>I don't. Why do they own so much?</UTT>I think it's a power trip, not sure. You know loudly that the government is doing what it wants to.</UTT>I agree with you. Do you think the US is as strict as China? They censor the word censor.</UTT>Wow, I don't think the US is as strict as China.</UTT>My brother is in China teaching English and even the Internet is locked down there. It's kind of odd that we publish the names of people who renounced their citizenship.</UTT>I agree, China is very strict from everything I've read, your brother is happy in China, I think the government goes too far most of the time in some countries.</UTT>He enjoyed China, he missed a lot here in the US back here. Are you a Hannon fan?</UTT>I bet he's missing a lot. I'm not sure you're talking about the singer, Jackson. I hear them on the radio once or twice.</UTT>Yes exactly, they are actually from a town near where I live in Oklahoma. You can believe they have the most requested song at an alt/rock station.</UTT>Wow, I didn't realize that. They've been pretty popular for awhile. Do you know that all radio has to play 40% Canadian music?</UTT>Haha I don't know that, I don't even really know many Canadian bands when I think about it.</UTT>I don't either. lol I think some government wants to rule everything. Men act like government officials and sell Eiffel towers twice.</UTT>If the government had to bail out JP Morgan, it might not have done too well.</UTT>It's right that our world is so mixed up. Hope our government and politicians make sense for change.</UTT>Will government shut down affect you? I can't believe government shuts down 17 times.</UTT>I'm not thankful, but I know many people and I think the government needs to not pay until everything is sorted out.</UTT>I hear many people still collect their salary when they don't work. That's not good.</UTT>I think that's what I heard, but only the actual workers are delayed in paying. As usual, the actual workers should still be paid. How the system works is not right.</UTT>Have a great day.</UTT>1

I don't like Jin Jong Un or his sister.</UTT>I don't know much about them.</UTT>When we have a reality TV president, many people look to the celebrity cult in politics.</UTT>I heard his defence minister was killed.</UTT>He killed many people. He tortured witnesses and members of his family.</UTT>I heard that about him. I don't even think they have the internet in North Korea.</UTT>Regular people don't, but the King does. When his people starve he has a lot.</UTT>Kim Jong Un appears to be cutting his hair too.</UTT>He's not like most celebrities who sure have money and fame.</UTT>He also apparently ordered repairs to the theme park.</UTT>I don't know anything about North Korea having a theme park. Many celebrities in the US make a lot of money, even minor celebrities like Judgement Judy.</UTT>I believe she makes a lot of money. She's on TV every day. It's hilarious.</UTT>Yes, I love that Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who believes Ethiopia can combat hunger by encouraging diverse eating.</UTT>That's very interesting, I've never heard of youtube star Jenna Marble, but she appears to make $34,6827.</UTT>Wow, I know youtube can pay some people a lot for the ads.</UTT>They do, though, and you have to wonder how long something like that can last.</UTT>But some even make much more than working for McDonalds.</UTT>This is true, and I wonder if people in North Korea can earn a living from YouTube.</UTT>I don't think people in North Korea have access to the Internet.</UTT>I don't think they do either, and barbers aren't good either apparently.</UTT>North Korea is an awful dictatorship run by Kim family for years.</UTT>1

Hello, do you like to watch movies?</UTT>I love to watch movies, you?</UTT>I do too. What genre are you in favor of?</UTT>I like all genres, but I usually favor drama, thrillers and comedy.</UTT>Oh cool, I wish I had taken Jon Hamm's drama class in high school. I'm somewhere today.</UTT>I wish I would have taken the drama to a famous teacher too. I might end up on TV or something. TC did a movie.</UTT>I prefer to work for Hughes Laurie. He makes the bank.</UTT>I bet he gets more pay than the rest of the cast combined. But he gets more talent than the rest.</UTT>He's still not as worth as Tom Cruise, or even Seinfeld.</UTT>Nobody is worth Seinfeld. A man is so rich he should start his own country. What does he do all day anyway? He counts his own money.</UTT>He's a real person, I bet it's a full time job. Do you know that TC built underground bunkers?</UTT>Yeah that sounds like scientology. I figure he was anticipating alien invasion. He may have spoken of aliens. Does he know who the UN ambassador is?</UTT>He's crazy, he even threatened a guy named Tom Kruse.</UTT>He very much protects his identity, I guess he thinks he has to defend his name. That way he is a street guy.</UTT>I guess he is. Jim Carrey isn't in the drama and avoided making it, but it's full.</UTT>I think he's wrong about that score. Drama can be uplifting and positive. I reckon he can do quite well in dramatic ways.</UTT>I think so too, except for the 23. Have you ever listened to any radio drama?</UTT>I did when I was younger. They may be quite exciting and dramatic. I can see why the kids love them.</UTT>I have to listen to them, I can find them for free online.</UTT>You should. Littlet Cranston like The Shadow. Great chat anyway.</UTT>Great chat as well, have a good night.</UTT>1

Hello, what have you done today?</UTT>Hello, I do good and you have an iphone by any chance?</UTT>I do good too. I have an iPhone. What about you?</UTT>I have no Android and I have Android but I have heard the iphone has more computing power than the entire United States nuclear deterrent from IBM.</UTT>I heard that too, which is kind of scary.</UTT>It really is, although the phone was a wonderful invention, just think about it. They convert the sound into electrical signals.</UTT>I can't imagine not having a phone. Area code is New York, dialing this number with a rotary dial is the fastest.</UTT>Is that right? I wonder what the rest of the country thinks of that when it comes to the area code decisions?</UTT>Not too sure. The cable that carried the phone and data line across the ocean was only 2.7 inches thick and just lay on the ocean floor.</UTT>All that information travels in such a small line is incredible.</UTT>I agree. Two phonebooks that overlap their pages cannot be separated together.</UTT>I actually heard that before, you know. I guess the phone book must be too thick for that.</UTT>I've seen that every minute you don't use your cell phone, UNICEF donates clean water to children in need.</UTT>That's a great program, would like to find out more about it. Do you know if you've signed up or anything like that?</UTT>I don't. Do you like Jumanji?</UTT>I like the original with Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt. It's good.</UTT>I do too. A boy from Jumanji voices chip on Beauty and the Beast.</UTT>I don't know about that. That's cool. Oh hey, I know Bradley Pierce did the original voice of mile on Sonic Hedgehog.</UTT>I don't know about that. Yumanji has a $36 million opening weekend in the US.</UTT>That's pretty good for something that started out as a child book in 1981.</UTT>I think so too Tim Curry voices the slick in the Jumanji cartoon.</UTT>I like him. The movie was taken from Chris Van Allsburg's book and he also wrote the movie, so good I bet.</UTT>1

Hello, are you politically interested at all?</UTT>I indeed am. Hillary Clinton is a politician I am pro-choice.</UTT>I like her too. She definitely raised herself to be a politician and was even a Young Republican president in college.</UTT>I find that interesting, but not surprising. What an accomplishment she has been. I guess she even has a grammy on her spoken word album in her book.</UTT>I never thought she would be famous that way. I saw Stephen Hawking's lecture on the White House, also featuring Clinton, online.</UTT>What an interesting idea. When you're associated with Stephen Hawking you know that you made it. I'm very excited to find out that she will be nominated for the 2016 presidential by the Democratic Party.</UTT>Oh yeah, she definitely raised her campaign to excellent. I think it's always strange how she pandered her audience like she put on a South accent while campaigning in the country.</UTT>I think she's smart, probably that's the reason she did that. I definitely think she could handle a president's job.</UTT>I think she might have too. I hold that she may only be awkward in a foreign relationship and lose things in translation. She and Sergey Lavrov press the reset button but it is incorrectly translated as overload.</UTT>I understand your point. The presidency is such an important role, I wish we could add her to the U.S. president's list.</UTT>And I think she's a good business person too. I wonder what she's worth. Maybe she's one of the wealthiest presidents of all time.</UTT>JFK, Washington, Jefferson are actually the three richest presidents. I wonder how she stacks up.</UTT>Wow, that's amazing. You think Trump is somewhere. The U.S. guest house is bigger than the White House.</UTT>You know, if Clinton was vice president this was 1805. I guess the runner up to the election became vice president before the 19th century.</UTT>The changes since then are definitely good. Now we seem more professional than the system. At least when the president is in office he releases 3 albums compared to other countries.</UTT>Hmmm, I wonder if his song ever got radioed?</UTT>I'm not sure. I bet we could tune in if they were. Can radio pick up anything from Jupiter even radio storms?</UTT>Radio is definitely such an underrated rate, it is very simple but effective. It is so simple that some soldiers in WWII made radio using razorblades and pencils.</UTT>That is incredible.</UTT>I agree wholeheartedly. There is also a website where you can listen to radio drama for free if you are interested.</UTT>That really sounds interesting. I prefer learning on the radio. I like one station a lot and they broadcast weekly news programs entirely in Classic Latin.</UTT>I love classical Latin, I bet Canada doesn't, though. I guess 40% of the radio plays need to be in the country. I bet they don't listen to Latin.</UTT>Oh yeah that's a strange law, you think radio is freer huh. Nice to talk to you and have a nice night.</UTT>1

It is so simple that some soldiers in WWII made radio using razorblades and pencils.</UTT>That is incredible.</UTT>I agree wholeheartedly. There is also a website where you can listen to radio drama for free if you are interested.</UTT>That really sounds interesting. I'd rather learn on the radio.</UTT>I love classical Latin, I bet Canada doesn't, though. I guess 40% of the radio plays need to be in the country. I bet they don't listen to Latin.</UTT>Oh yeah that's a strange law, you think radio is freer huh. Nice to talk to you and have a nice night.</UTT>0
Hey, there, what do you think about the President and who is the wealthiest top president?</UTT>I think Kennedy and maybe Bush are probably the 3 richest presidents. Am I right?</UTT>Actually, JFK, Washington, and also Jefferson. I didn't predict that, but I guess if you account for inflation, it makes sense. Have you heard of Zimbabwe's president yet?</UTT>I don't know who is the president of Zimbabwe. I know that a former president can't run for president in Guatemala.</UTT>Actually, banana is the president of Zimbabwe. I wonder if he has a vice president named plantain and Indonesians have released 3 pop albums and I kinda want to listen to them haha.</UTT>Wow, Presidents around the world are very interested. You know Woodrow Wilson is the only one of us with a doctorate.</UTT>I don't know about that. We should have more Presidents than PHDs. Today you know that the vice president became a President before 1905 so you have Trump and Clinton as vice presidents.</UTT>I know that, so it's even harder to work against your opponents than you can lose an election when you have a popular vote. 5 presidential candidates.</UTT>That's hard, I wonder if that's more or less hard and three pop albums made while Indonesia's president is in office?</UTT>It seems difficult to me. It's also hard to learn another language. Last President FDR spoke foreign languages.</UTT>That's interesting. I think it's weird that when they vote Nevada has none of these candidates options, and I think it could be used in other states as well, and it's useful.</UTT>Wow, I wonder if we ever had a president or an inauguration. First President Lincoln photographed his inauguration with John Wilkes Booth.</UTT>Well that's very scary. You definitely know that over the past 100 years our top voter participation percentage has maxed out at about 63%, which really seems low to me.</UTT>I especially believe Hank is placed third in the Virginia Senate election. I'm not sure people take voting seriously.</UTT>I don't think so. Especially since the idea is that the taller candidate would win about 75% of the time, it's highly unlikely, and probably not because of a TV factor that shows the difference in height.</UTT>He may not be tall, but the dog beat two people to the mayor. He served 13 years.</UTT>Haha, that's funny, I wonder if his daily routine consist of? In terms of elections, have you heard that ancient Athens used to just use the lottery system? I can see how the dog was elected lol.</UTT>All elections are conducted by mail in Oregon. I am so surprised at how different elections can be across the world.</UTT>That's interesting, by the way, did you go to any concerts? They should have a concert on the presidential election haha.</UTT>That's great, thanks for the chat. I've learned a lot of cool new things.</UTT>lol I did too and made sure to avoid free concerts.</UTT>1

Five events for their candidates.</UTT>That's hard, I wonder if that's more or less hard and three pop albums made while Indonesia's president is in office?</UTT>It seems difficult to me.

Do you know that Bruce Lee is a great dancer?</UTT>No, but I figure dancing comes easy because he's so good at moving to martial arts. More surprising was Mr. Rogers's learning to break dance during the episode.</UTT>Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.</UTT>Another actress to win dances: Emilia Clarke. When she auditioned for Game of Two, she did funky chicken dances and robot dances.</UTT>That doesn't seem to help her get the part. Tupac danced ballet in high school.</UTT>Really, I always thought he was soft inside. Ballet: Slippers that made the dancers move.</UTT>That looks like modern art to me. Tupac obtained the role of mouse king through the production of Nutcracker so he took it seriously.</UTT>Bill Bailey, a tap dancer, took his job seriously. I think Michael Jackson was the first person this whole time.</UTT>I don't know about that. When the baby hears music, she spontaneously dances, so I lose my sense of rhythm between the years of 5 and 10</UTT>Richard Nixon had a great sense of rhythm, wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show.</UTT>That is incredible. A ballet dancer can wear out four pairs of shoes a week. Looks like that could find a more durable material.</UTT>Dance is such beautiful art - parrots even get into the act - they can dance perfectly to music.</UTT>My daughter used to have an African Grey. I saw it done. My wife played a string piano, but with a hammer could be a percussion instrument that set a beat for a parrot.</UTT>You think a parrot can dance to the sound of a piano. It's crazy to think that steam pianos used to exist and I hear them very loud.</UTT>They can be moved by beat. Lola Anastatove is a gorgeous pianist or something like that I've seen on YouTube. Freddie Mercury uses the same piano that Paul McCartney used to record Bohemian Rhapsody.</UTT>Interesting fact. I saw a youtube video of a mute man who wandered through the streets of England and was only able to communicate with him by piano.</UTT>In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano.</UTT>How in the world can a piano be placed there? Fun fact about the piano: Mozart and Haydn, two of the biggest composers of the classical era, own the piano made from the same tree.</UTT>That's a fun fact. I guess the helicopter is in the piano's place. They need a light grand piano on the Handenburg so they make it out of aluminum and it weighs 356 pounds.</UTT>All these fun piano facts and think Italy was the county that invented the piano.</UTT>We have a 7 ft 6 in our house a grand, it is a great instrument, don't forget to look up Lola, the greatest female pianist of the day, nice talk.</UTT>1

Do you like to watch youtube?</UTT>I watched youtube this morning. I even subscribed to a new video.</UTT>Nice. It's awesome. It's the second most visited search engine.</UTT>It's popular and has been around since 2005.</UTT>That's a long time. I think Google owns it now. Good investment. They have the first and second popular search engines.</UTT>Wow, that's incredible. I like Facebook as well, it started a year before youtube in 2004.</UTT>Wow, time is flowing, I like facebook most of the time. Can you believe Myspace turned you down to buy it?</UTT>They have to kick themselves. That's a 10 billion dollar company.</UTT>Right, it only costs $5 million, they should have bought it anyways because it is a competition.</UTT>True, I've been on facebook for so long that I remember it expanding to people in higher education institutions.</UTT>I started in 2006 I think. How cool to start. I don't like the blue look.</UTT>Oh, that's because the founders only suffer from color blindness, red and green.</UTT>Oh well, that makes sense, lol. I wonder why it isn't put in other colors though. I would say it is worth 1.4 billion.</UTT>They got money from the advertisers. The Burger King once had a promotion to not unfriend people for a whopper. lol</UTT>I love that promotion, did you participate in that?</UTT>No, but if I was hungry enough I would have. LOL I use like buttons on facebook, but do you know that they are illegal in german states?</UTT>I too should have done it and have hundreds of friends I could delete. I wonder why it is illegal. I think.</UTT>I'm not sure. I know they use it to suggest their constitution in Ireland.</UTT>That's awesome, people are powerful, I'm sure they'll hear crazy ideas though, so nice to chat.</UTT>Great to chat with you as well.</UTT>Enjoy your day and don't add some friends for that whopper.</UTT>1

Are you in Hall in Springfield Massachusetts?</UTT>I don't have?</UTT>I was in Springfield and observing.</UTT>Wow, what an experience! By the way, have you watched basketball?</UTT>I'm not such a big fan, but at least I know where the NBA stands.</UTT>I'm a fan of it. Do you know Reggie Miller?</UTT>His team? Golden State?</UTT>Indiana. His sister, Cheryl, is a basketball player.</UTT>Oh, I see it as common for pro players to play family, like Seth Curry and Stephen Curry's brother Mychel Thompson to play back on court.</UTT>Exactly. BTW, you know Allen Irving has a lifetime contract with Reebook and when he turns 55 he gets $3 million.</UTT>Oh my god, they pay too much, can he be paid lump sum?</UTT>That's a lump sum guy such a lucky guy.</UTT>Hey, that's definitely lucky, but I can't shoot the ball the way they do on a 9.4-inch court, so I guess they deserve it because they get talent.</UTT>They are the best in the world. They deserve money. Do you also know Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?</UTT>Well master and train. Well, you know it's strange that the guy who invented busketball under the name James was the only loser coach in the history of the University of Kansas. In no particulars.</UTT>I really don't know how such a coach would have a losing record. Basketball player Abdul used to be very famous and very tall.</UTT>Oh my god, all the players are tall and I think it requires a good game.</UTT>That's the nature of the game. Some of them aren't quite as tall as they are, but this is an exception. Do you also know Tim Duncan?</UTT>That's fascinating, and I know Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs.</UTT>He favors players because of his talents on course and off course personality.</UTT>He seems disciplined somewhere and I've read that he stayed in college for 4 years instead of going directly to the NBA.</UTT>Exactly, btw, have a nice chat with you. Have a happy holiday.</UTT>Happy holidays too.</UTT>Bye.</UTT>1

Do you know anything about astronomy and planets?</UTT>Hello, I know a little bit. What about you?</UTT>Not too much, but I want to learn about the earth.</UTT>Do you know that more than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests have been destroyed?</UTT>That's terrible, do you know the earth is aging?</UTT>I don't. How old is it?</UTT>I believe it is 45 million years old. In the early days of the planet, you know that a day is much shorter.</UTT>That was a long time, I don't know about that about the shorter days either. I see the UN appointing an extraterrestrial ambassador in 2010.</UTT>I wonder if extraterrestrials are listening to the Jupiter radio storm?</UTT>I bet they would if they existed. Hard to believe you can hear them on earth.</UTT>However, Canada is not the country where all radio must play 40% of Canadian music.</UTT>That's an odd law. WW2 soldiers made radios using razorblades and pencils as diodes.</UTT>I wonder if one can build a guitar with a crude tool like that.</UTT>I bet someone can come up with a way to do that.</UTT>It may not be possible to set speakers on fire like Eddie Van Halen once did.</UTT>Haha, that's awesome. Pink Fluff's guitarist turned a houseboat on the river into a floating recording studio.</UTT>I wonder if a guitar smashed like Matthew Bellamy would sink into such a location.</UTT>LOL Brian May used a coin for the pick.</UTT>He's also a smart guy with an astrophysics doctorate.</UTT>Wow, that's pretty amazing. I've never guessed that.</UTT>I guess it might help. It is certainly more than classical Latin, which is only useful if you listen to Finnish news shows every week.</UTT>1

Hello, who are you tonight? You didn't see a Tesla car.</UTT>I actually drove a Tesla before. What about you? I like that they have a lot of new vehicles coming out these days like the S and X.</UTT>Yeah, I heard they came out in a new car. Exciting. What do you think of Elon Mosk? I watched him a few times in my interview.</UTT>He was very entertaining and I think he did an interview. I'm crazy that the Tesla Model S was so safe that it somehow broke the safety testing equipment because I don't know how it could happen.</UTT>I really agree with that, I see where he took a $7.8 million pay cut in 2014.</UTT>Yeah, that's impressive, Tesla also impressed by releasing their patents to encourage competition, if they own the company, I definitely wouldn't do that.</UTT>Most people don't (you wonder why) for environmental reasons. Who knows, maybe something else is going to be in line.</UTT>Yeah, I agree, it's crazy they're naming themselves Nikola Teslas, but they're not the only company naming themselves Nikola. Another car company apparently just called her Nicole.</UTT>Interesting that I owned an electric car for 3 years and it was easy to drive. My husband named it a phantom. He couldn't be here when he got home.</UTT>Well, electric cars benefit from that, haha. On a different note though, what do you think of Fox News apparently broadcasting over 86 countries around the world?</UTT>It's only the one I'm watching these days. I don't know if Richard Nixon was one of the creators.</UTT>I don't know that either. I also don't know if they are suing The Simpsons for keeping parodying it. Do I think Fox owns it?</UTT>I do too. I don't know if they just created a cable channel for The Simpsons. Did you watch that show?</UTT>I like Fox News, but the viewership is interesting, it seems 68, which is the median age for viewing.</UTT>That's strange, you find that hard to believe. I believe Fox News is more watched than CNN and MSNBC combined.</UTT>I think you are right. Also interesting is that Fox News only has 55% of the opinion pieces, but in my opinion they definitely have better.</UTT>I think so. Do you like dancing? I love watching babies dance to music. You are adorable.</UTT>I agree with you. I also think it's funny that a girl from Game of Tony danced to a robot and also a fucky chicken at the audition. I wish I could see that tape!</UTT>Ha, I can imagine that. I'm not surprised that MJ uses the device to lean dance moves. Is that in Smooth Criminal?</UTT>I think so. I'm also shocked that he has patented that device. The first moonwalk performance in 1955 was crazy, so the dance moves were actually old moves.</UTT>You really don't know that. They had a kind of different move in 1955. Good chat.</UTT>Thanks too, next time you see some ballet slippers apparently making performers move on the floor, watch out.</UTT>1

Hey, did you ever get hot chocolate at 7:11am?</UTT>I can't remember. I guess some lades in VA used it when two carjackers approached.</UTT>Yeah she's 50 and actually a good idea is using hot piped liquid to fend them off lol.</UTT>The police report only noted that her 22-year-old daughter had done it, but the article was unclear. I still guess it worked.</UTT>LOL People should carry hot chocolate instead of a gun, but I guess hot chocolate is 170 degrees Celsius (insane guess).</UTT>Yeah, you haven't heard of people dying with hot chocolate at 171 degrees Celsius.</UTT>Yep, 158C water causes 3deg burns, they definitely get the thief burned.</UTT>It comes from a guy in AL who uses hot coffee for two robberies. It doesn't say if he was caught.</UTT>Before you spoke about the robbery, did you get into the car? Guess who got into the lady's car about to before she was accosted?</UTT>Nope, in South Africa, it is legal to equip one's car with flame-throwing devices to prevent such events.</UTT>Wow, that's cool. Like after a beating, someone beats 90000 people in a Gran Turismo game and then becomes a professional race car driver.</UTT>I don't know. I know McDonald's would be happy to add a drive through to help the soldiers and will help them as well.</UTT>Hahaha, it definitely helps me be lazy, they don't want soldiers to have to get out of their car in their uniform.</UTT>It's sad that Pilgrims get raped in bum clothes that are boring. They are actually full of color and only wear black for special occasions. I see a "Grateful Death" tie-dye for them.</UTT>Hahaha that's sad, I wonder what Apple's clothing from the 80's looked like back then, they actually had their own clothing line.</UTT>I don't remember that, they still sell t-shirts.</UTT>I must have looked that up. Do you buy a t-shirt made in North Korea? The Rip Curl shirt is made there, but they say China on the tag?</UTT>I'm not a fan of their crazy leaders, you know some ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week, their feet are poor.</UTT>That sounds hurtful, what do you think of putting a dry tea bag in a smelly shoe, you seem to be trying to make it smell better.</UTT>Maybe they should try some 5000 year old shoes. They will find some that perform better than modern shoes.</UTT>I want to see how those shoes look. Do you know Stephen Marbury? He apparently promoted some $15 shoes but he didn't pay?</UTT>1
Hey, did you ever get hot chocolate at 7:11am?</UTT>I can't remember. I guess some lades in VA used it when two carjackers approached.</UTT>Yeah, she's a teenager and actually a good idea is to use hot piped liquid to fend them off lol.</UTT>The police report only noted that her 22-year-old daughter had done it, but the article was unclear. I still guess it worked.</UTT>LOL People should carry hot chocolate instead of a gun, but I guess hot chocolate is 170 degrees Celsius (insane guess).</UTT>Yeah, you haven't heard of people dying with hot chocolate at 171 degrees Celsius.</UTT>Yep, 158C water causes 3deg burns, they definitely get the thief burned.</UTT>It comes.</UTT>Before you spoke about the robbery, did you get into the car? Guess who got into the lady's car about to before she was accosted?</UTT>Nope.</UTT>Wow, that's cool. Like after a beating, someone beats 90000 people in a Gran Turismo game and then becomes a professional race car driver.</UTT>I don't know. I know McDonald's would be happy to add a drive through to help the soldiers and will help them as well.</UTT>Hahaha, it definitely helps me be lazy, they don't want soldiers to have to get out of their car in their uniform.</UTT>It's sad that Pilgrims get raped in bum clothes that are boring. They are actually full of color and only wear black for special occasions. I see a "Grateful Death" tie-dye for them.</UTT>Hahaha that's sad, I wonder what Apple's clothing from the 80's looked like back then, they actually had their own clothing line.</UTT>I don't remember that.</UTT>I must have looked that up. Do you buy a t-shirt made in North Korea? The Rip Curl shirt is made there, but they say China on the tag?</UTT>I'm not a fan of their crazy leaders, you know some ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week, their feet are poor.</UTT>That sounds hurtful, what do you think of putting a dry tea bag in a smelly shoe, you seem to be trying to make it smell better.</UTT>Maybe they should try some 5000 year old shoes. They find some that perform better than modern shoes. I don't remember. I guess some lades in VA used to liaise her when two carjackers approached.</UTT>I want to see how those shoes look. Do you know Stephen Marbury? He apparently promoted some $15 shoes but he didn't pay?</UTT>0
Hi, look forward to chatting with you.</UTT>Hi, I'm too.</UTT>Hey, do you know what Myspace is? Ever had an account with it?</UTT>I have a MySpace account, I kind of love it. But then Facebook took over lol.</UTT>Do you know that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for 75 million dollars in early 2005?</UTT>Wow, I guess that's a huge loss. Now, Facebook is so big, you know that most of Facebook is blue because Zappenberg is some color blind.</UTT>I know he's color bling, but I don't know why Facebook is blue.</UTT>I think that's pretty interesting. Once Burger King had a promotion that if you don't unfriend 10 people you get a whopper for free. Crazy!</UTT>Have you ever unfriended anybody?</UTT>LOL, I know all my facebook friends well.</UTT>I haven't unfriended some people, I wonder if they know they aren't?</UTT>I guess they may know if they have seen or not your posts.</UTT>They may just think I haven't posted anything.</UTT>True, do you like any TV show?</UTT>Plenty. I'm watching Ray Donovan now. Are you?</UTT>I like That 70's Show sometimes and I love Grey's Anatomy.</UTT>I missed both?</UTT>Very good. I like comedy and drama. LOL they cancelled That 70s show in the UK.</UTT>But is it the same show or is it a different crew re-created?</UTT>That 70S was just reruns, but the series continues, Grays Anatomy.</UTT>But in the UK, is our version of that show or are they going to make our version?</UTT>Oh, I don't know. Good question. I sometimes watch it as a funny cartoon called Southpark.</UTT>I love the satire about current events in South Park, the same on Family Guy and Simpsons.</UTT>Yes, I'm too, are you a fan of the newest phones at all?</UTT>I don't really like my 2 year old Android phone.</UTT>I like my older android as well. The price is too high for me. Great chat, have a great night.</UTT>1

Remember the confidential informant in the Trump campaign?</UTT>I vaguely remember that, I haven't. Is it the FBI spy?</UTT>It's not FBI spying, but someone just was concerned about the connections between the Trump campaign and Russia during the campaign.</UTT>Oh ok it was a confidential informant. Trump claimed it was spying on the FBI, not the FBI.</UTT>Correct, even Lindsey Graham agrees he isn't a spy.</UTT>Right, the GOP doesn't seem to want to back Trump on that whole spygate thing.</UTT>They can stand up to Trump last time. The head of state in most republics is the title, not the dictatorship.</UTT>Right, even though 5 people were elected while still losing popular votes.</UTT>The Republicans lost popular votes in 6 of the last 7 elections because the demographic of traditional people has shrinked.</UTT>That's true, they also don't seem very interested in reaching out beyond their traditional demographic. I wonder how they plan to survive in the future.</UTT>I'm not sure. They've been largely supported by the south, mountainous states and evangelicals in recent years. All urban areas are blue.</UTT>Hillary Clinton was apparently a Republican in college.</UTT>I don't know about that, but she may be like me, and as she ages she grows more liberal. Even since Reagan the Republican Party has grown far more right.</UTT>It's hard to relate to the GOP at times. I try to be objective, but even harder to consider a vote that denies climate change and has people like Mike Pence who believe in conversion therapy.</UTT>I completely agree. After the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act they started shifting from the right to the very conservative. Right now it seems to be their big thing to take away voting rights.</UTT>Yeah, they aren't Lincoln's party they claim. Richard Nixon proposed guaranteed minimum income though.</UTT>Sure yes. I find it funny that Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on Dumbo rides because he didn't want to be associated with Republicans.</UTT>That's really funny. The first President Lincoln was photographed, John Wilkes Booth was photographed... Wow.</UTT>Wow, that's crazy. It's fit for a republican because every US president has a beard.</UTT>Wow,Trump should grow a beard.</UTT>I'm not sure about the orange beard, he might look like the first Zimbabwean president to be called Banana.</UTT>1

You find it kind of hard to read the first part of this? I think it is somewhat emotional upset.</UTT>I concur. Shooting innocent children is the worst crime ever.</UTT>I can't imagine what would have happened if I was in that situation.</UTT>I could bear to watch these incidents, so when I saw them, I turned off my TV set.</UTT>I kinda like that way of news on TV, and there always seems to be negative stuff like what is mentioned in this article.</UTT>You watch a lot of TV by any chance.</UTT>Most NFC channels are not public. Do you watch much TV?</UTT>I used to do, but I don't now because I'm quite busy. Any chance you know that the 1970s show was verbatim remade in the UK.</UTT>I don't know if you know that Star Wars is the most successful film merchandise franchise.</UTT>I know they've had big successes, but they've not had this success.</UTT>Yeah, have you ever absolutely played with the Xbox?</UTT>I play it a lot of the time I'm free?</UTT>What game would you absolutely like to play?</UTT>Football fantasy, Autothef, and similar things?</UTT>Fortnite, Overwatch, Halo...</UTT>Oh, they're a good game.</UTT>I like them a lot. You know the army uses Xbox 360 controllers to fly Uav Spy planes.</UTT>Do you know that the controller was created as quadrilpegic so it can play Xbox 360 and other consoles?</UTT>I'm pretty fascinated that I didn't.</UTT>Do you know that the army uses Xbox 360 controllers to fly UAV spy planes?</UTT>I know that.</UTT>1

Hey, have you ever used facebook?</UTT>I do. It is the primary news source for 30% of American adults. Do you use Facebook?</UTT>Unfortunately, it's constant. If I like Burger King, I'd consider offering to get WHopper for free by unfriending 10 people.</UTT>That's cool, because everyone uses Facebook now and there are more people there than there were 200 years ago.</UTT>They have come a long way since 2004.</UTT>They did because anyone who claimed to be at least 13 could register since 2006.</UTT>I heard that Ireland re-wrote its constitution using input from people on facebook. I suppose that will do it in the 21st century.</UTT>I can just imagine Facebook ruining people's lives and children, it's probably sad, because all the divorces in 2011 in the United States contain the word.</UTT>That's sad. Do you remember when we all communicated immediately by telephone? I remember as a kid being excited to pick it up and see who was calling?</UTT>I do too. Life was so simple in the 90's, someone called me so excited, you know, a luxury phone maker who hired a London symphony orchestra to record ringtones.</UTT>Wow, that doesn't seem necessary. I wonder if they did a theme song about Benny Hill?</UTT>I'm not sure, but that's so funny.</UTT>I've heard once that you can't pull two phonebooks apart if you interleave all the pages. I think mythbusters confirm it.</UTT>Wow, that's crazy, you know dolphins communicate with each other by telephone and even recognize each other by phone.</UTT>That's awesome. I often wonder if they're really smarter than us.</UTT>I'm not sure. I think humans are the smartest creatures. The inventor of dial-up telephones was convinced when talking about intelligence that telephone operators were rerouting their calls to rival businesses.</UTT>Sounds paranoid to me.</UTT>He has to. Do you know that President Andrew Johnson never attended school in his lifetime?</UTT>That explains his presidency. History people used to have bad poetry contests, CS Lewis and Tolkien.</UTT>That really sounds interesting.</UTT>The criteria are laugh and lose.</UTT>Nice to talk to you.</UTT>Likewise.</UTT>Bye.</UTT>1

Hi there, like cars? Because I never got to go anywhere without cars.</UTT>It's very useful to get around. I don't know what to do if I don't have it.</UTT>Have you heard loudly the flame-throwing car they have in South Africa?</UTT>Yeah, so carjacking is pretty bad there.</UTT>No doubt. You know when and why McDonalds added drive thrus.</UTT>I heard soldiers were behind it.</UTT>Yes, they added them in 1975. You know, the back of the car used to be known as the trunk, as in the old days, cars carried woods on it.</UTT>That makes a lot of sense. I've heard it called a "boot" in England.</UTT>That's interesting. Do you know the name of the car brand, Cameron?</UTT>ii) It is a French exploration. Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac</UTT>You get a super chat high five. I'm surprised to see that the car was the first to be patented in 1886.</UTT>Yeah, I always thought Ford did all that, but first, they were mass produced.</UTT>I believe Ford made the Model T in 1908.</UTT>Yes, that is correct.</UTT>Would you like to read?</UTT>I do. I don't understand the moral panic of the 18th century though.</UTT>I'm not. Reading is one of the few forms of entertainment people have back then. Many military organizations suggest reading the Enders Game.</UTT>It's a good book, have you read it? I'm not sure it's military material for reading.</UTT>I haven't read it either. I haven't read the Starship Trooper listed by 5 branches of the US military.</UTT>I've read the Enders Game, but not Starship Troubles. If the military recommends it, it may be good.</UTT>So it is. I have seen both movies though. LOL, I must get to go. It's fun to chat with you.</UTT>1

What do you know about the earth?</UTT>Funny you should ask. I watched Cosmos on netflix and learned that the Earth formed over 45 million years ago. I wonder what people looked like back then.</UTT>Probably a strand of amino acids or something.</UTT>Hahaha good guess, the day was only 5.5 hours when the Earth was formed, why is it now 24 hours?</UTT>Who knows, the rotation of the Earth could change.</UTT>I feel out of time already in a 24 hour period, can't imagine living for 5 hours a day, and need sleep.</UTT>Well, it sounds like almost three days of straight sleep, but very restful.</UTT>Too little restful. More than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests are already destroyed. Why do you think they are destroyed so rapidly?</UTT>Well logging, clearing farmland, and increasing human population to name a few.</UTT>Some believe it has something to do with extraterrestrials. If they ever contact the earth, the UN will even appoint an official ambassador for them.</UTT>I mean, other people can live high in the vastness of the universe. People should not shirk responsibility for destroying natural forests by simply blaming aliens.</UTT>I agree we must preserve the environment, over 70 billion humans live on earth and depend on their natural resources. Do you do anything to preserve the environment?</UTT>Well my small part is trying to limit plastic use, conscious of business practices and sources of items I use and helping to plant trees to combat desertification in the desert.</UTT>That's awesome, where did I sign up to help plant the trees? I watched a couple of those on Netflix which led me to watch other ones and contributed to taking up half the peak internet traffic with binge watching the NFL.</UTT>I mean Netflix is a convenient service. When considering Reed built a multi-billion dollar company after racketing up late fees of 40, I think the trade-off is worth it.</UTT>It's very well worth it. I'm also a victim of that substantial late fee and now wonder how Blockbuster feels about declining an offer to buy Nine for $5 million in discount rates. How do you feel?</UTT>Well, they even no longer exist to regret it lol.</UTT>That's true, but NFC has huge debt to develop new content, at least $2 billion, but people love their service.</UTT>Well, most companies are leveraged and are incurring debt today to have better success tomorrow.</UTT>It is true that you feel that robots are more prevalent these days. Some people fear taking over these workers jobs because robots are capable of performing tasks such as debonizing chickens.</UTT>People can laze around doing more work with robots, which is ideal, but there is no clear direction we are heading in. I think robots can do all our jobs one day. There is debate over whether something like a matrix can be done, but within one minute people will consider a Hitchler test.</UTT>What a scary thought. Have a good day.</UTT>1

Good evening, can it be fun to have President Banana in the White House? Actually, the name of the first Zimbabwean president is the first name of the country, but we can dream.</UTT>That's certainly fun!</UTT>Trump may need to follow the footsteps of the Indonesian President and make some pop albums. He may need that to win over one of his biggest critics.</UTT>Pop album with Kyanye. Then declare a national emergency that will require everyone to buy a copy.</UTT>LOL It's like the VP, Hilary! That's our system until the early 1800's!</UTT>Hillary and Trump are in the White House together. They don't even have eye contact.</UTT>They probably changed the rules better. They could make some amazing television.</UTT>There's a lot of drama out there, the greatest reality TV out there. Trump v. Hillary, who's going to vote out of the White House?</UTT>They play their cards right, they can release episodes every day, and they can catch up on the output of pokemon for a couple of years.</UTT>I have never seen pokemon and I don't think I've ever seen it.</UTT>If you ever get it, you can binge on all those episodes like crazy. Ii got Thomas the Tank Engine here with my kids, they were amazing narrator for that show.</UTT>I guess the work show is fun and the stars really enjoy lending their talents to it (only a bit) It's a lot more classy than pokemon.</UTT>The theme song already rings in my ears. Can I learn it on the piano?</UTT>Can't hurt. First, find a good instrument. Freddie Mercury may own a good one.</UTT>That's the same one Paul McCarty recorded with Hey Jude. Some amazing rock history isn't it with that piano, is it?</UTT>Sure it does, and if you get your hands on it, you can contribute a song to that legacy too.</UTT>I can only succeed in key smashing, at least I know that even the best people can't play the Circus Galup designed for stress testing that auto piano.</UTT>I wonder who the composer is. The type of engineer is probably.</UTT>Speaking to engineers, someone could build an aluminum piano that weighed more than 350 pounds and was once ridden in the handenburg lounge.</UTT>I bet it was a work of art, but how does it sound? Tinny probably.</UTT>It's hard to imagine it would sound like some of the better designed pianos. If we return to a time when the news doesn't feel the need to report any news, rather than playing their music, then something will happen.</UTT>That's not money, just make some up, enjoy the chat, have a good night.</UTT>You too.</UTT>1

That's our system until the early 1800's!</UTT>Hillary and Trump are in the White House together. They don't even have eye contact.</UTT>They probably changed the rules better. They could make some amazing television.</UTT>There's a lot of drama out there, the greatest reality TV out there. Trump v. Hillary, who's going to vote out of the White House?</UTT>They play their cards right, they can release episodes every day, and they can catch up on the output of pokemon for a couple of years.</UTT>I have never seen pokemon and I don't think I've ever seen it.</UTT>If you ever get it, you can binge on all those episodes like crazy. Ii got Thomas the Tank Engine here with my kids, they were amazing narrator for that show.</UTT>I guess the work show is fun and the stars really enjoy lending their talents to it (only a bit) It's a lot more classy than pokemon.</UTT>The theme song already rings in my ears. Can I learn it on the piano?</UTT>Can't hurt. First, find a good instrument. Freddie Mercury may own a good one.</UTT>That's the same one Paul McCarty recorded with Hey Jude. Some amazing rock history isn't it with that piano, is it?</UTT>Sure it does, and if you get your hands on it, you can contribute a song to that legacy too.</UTT>I can only succeed in key smashing, at least I know that even the best people can't play the Circus Galup designed for stress testing that auto piano.</UTT>I wonder if there is more than composition. The type of engineer is probably.</UTT>Speaking to engineers, someone could build an aluminum piano that weighed more than 350 pounds and was once ridden in the handenburg lounge.</UTT>I bet it was a work of art, but how does it sound? Tinny probably.</UTT>It's hard to imagine it would sound like some of the better designed pianos. If we return to a time when the news doesn't feel the need to report any news, rather than playing their music, then something will happen.</UTT>That's not money, just make some up, enjoy the chat, have a good night.</UTT>Any of you.</UTT>0
Have you any chance of enjoying the NBA?</UTT>NBA, I'm a professional sports fan of the New York Knicks and grew up idolizing Allen Irving.</UTT>He did well for himself. He then signed a contract with Reebok, which paid him $800,000 a year until he was 55, a lump sum of $32,200.</UTT>Incredible. Sure, what he did for the brand reebok was not in vain. I love his commercials featuring rapist Jadakiss.</UTT>I don't remember that commercial. Did you know that Air Jordan was banned in the NBA when it was released?</UTT>It's impossible to believe it, but Jordan still wear them anyway, because Nike is willing to pay a fine for each game.</UTT>That makes it easy. Are you familiar with Tim Duncan?</UTT>The forwards are arguably the greatest and most versatile players all time for the San Antonio Spurs.</UTT>That's him. He stayed in college for 4 years and sacrificed money instead of going directly to the NBA.</UTT>Tim has always stuck to his morals and core values. Even after retiring from the NBA these days.</UTT>I'm glad to hear that. Do you know that his sister Reggie Miller overshadowed him in high school? She broke the national record for eight basketballs.</UTT>Cheryl is an outstanding high school and college player. The story goes that Reggie scored 40 points in the game and brags about it on the way home only to learn he scored 105 points.</UTT>Hope it keeps him humble. Do you realize Kareem Abdul-Jabbar got a college ban for over a decade because he's so successful at it?</UTT>That's almost as shocking as learning that James Nismith, the basketball inventor, was the only coach in the history of the University of Kansas.</UTT>Unfortunately, that's not what you expect, I'm kind of disgusted by people who are government employees with the highest pay, in 39 of the 50 states coaching college football or basketball.</UTT>Especially since college athletes don't receive a dime and can't hold a job.</UTT>I agree, it's ridiculous, we emphasize sports too much at that point, do you know the Supreme Court has basketball courts?</UTT>The highest court in the land is known.</UTT>Ha, that's funny, you also know about the New Zealand basketball game?</UTT>Basketball is a global sport and is very popular especially in Europe and China. Unfortunately New Zealand does not have a team name with a racial undertone.</UTT>I heard it was called the Tall Blacks and wondered what came of it and if it was racist.</UTT>1

How did it go about it? Do you know that the term planet is of ancient origin and has ties to history, science and other stuff?</UTT>I don't. You know that Jupiter's moon ganymede is considered a planet if it orbits the sun.</UTT>Wow, so if there is no Jupiter, ganymede must be pretty huge.</UTT>I know. Venice has no seasons because it isn't tilted. It's only a clock-rotating planet.</UTT>Uranus rotates weirdly too, and sideways.</UTT>It makes me giggle every time. I'm not so mature.</UTT>Uranus rolled around the sun instead of spinning.</UTT>The sun is actually white, but is only perceived as yellow due to the atmosphere scattering.</UTT>That makes sense, because I don't know if it's a near perfect sphere of hot plasma.</UTT>At least it's not like a lightening bolt. A lightening bolt is about 5 times hotter than the sun's surface.</UTT>That's crazy, funny how the lightning bolts are hotter, but the sun can produce enough energy to meet the earth's needs in 500000 years.</UTT>Sept. 11, 2011 - Neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since it was discovered in 1846. That's been a long rotation.</UTT>That's nuts, I guess the planet precipitates glass.</UTT>Hush, I don't know that. More than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.</UTT>That sucks because only 29% of the Earth is land and most forests are gone.</UTT>Only 5.5 hours in a day when the Earth first formed. I can't get anything done.</UTT>That's fast, and I hear the moon's rotation slows down because it interacts with the Earth's gravitational field.</UTT>Wow, the United Nations appointed an extraterrestrial official ambassador in July 2010 if they ever had contact with the Earth.</UTT>That might come in handy, as astronomers have detected a building block of life 455 light years away.</UTT>By the end of the 21st century, the Earth will be virtually helium free. Sad, high pitched, no more talk.</UTT>That's what man sucks for. If the entire history of the earth is viewed as a 24-hour period, the human represents only 1 minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>1

You play fantasy football?</UTT>No, but I have a fantasia about playing football. Does it count? I imagine I would be the current left-handed NFL quarterback, Kelvin Moore.</UTT>I guess it does. I didn't play fantasy football so yeah, he's the only left-wing quarterback. Interesting fact?</UTT>Jim Kelly of the Bills is also a left winger, and only Kelly is a left winger today. Do you know the only one who won the Superbowl to be an African-American?</UTT>I don't know that either. I guess most quarterbacks are white.</UTT>The quarterbacks Doug Williams and Russell Wilson won the Superbowl.</UTT>I remember him being a really talented Rush Wilson. I guess you know Bay.</UTT>Of course he doesn't have a TV show called "The Brady Bully" Oh, I guess that's fantasy. Have you ever seen the Jim Henson directed movie "The Dark Crystal"?</UTT>I'm not sure about that. He used to play on the Jnipero High School team, and was benched by the coach for the whole season, and I guess he doesn't have the talent.</UTT>Brady sure proved him wrong. There is a $600 million football stadium in Allen, Texas with 18000 seats. Yeah, football is big in Texas.</UTT>He did. Brady is now in the fame hall and the best player in NFL history and that's a real 60 billion dollars. Wow, that's a lot of money.</UTT>I bet Brady makes a lot of money too. The US pays big time for football players and coaches. You know that the Department of Defense employees are the highest paid.</UTT>I bet he will, too, that's a new fact, interesting, why does the Department of Defense need a coach?</UTT>They coach service branch teams like Army, Navy, Air Force, etc. There are huge stadiums in their academy too. Do you know of 14 college football stadiums, one of the 25 biggest?</UTT>College stadiums are really, really not pro stadiums, I guess college football also moves a lot of cash.</UTT>Big money for college. I like how football brings families together. Rapper Snoop Dog wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team.</UTT>Snoop Dog is one of my favorite performers, football is a nice game and ESPN has the most valuable contribution to the game.</UTT>Yeah, what's that?</UTT>Even ESPN won the first yellow line down and won awards for it.</UTT>Interesting world in which we live, where people hail from superimposing imaginary lines on TV screens. Sounds like fantasy. You know universities where people can study science fiction and fantasy literature by concentrating on Tolkien's studies. An imaginary line and an imaginary tale.</UTT>I don't know about that, but if people play Fantasy spelling Bee, I guess anything is possible.</UTT>1

Any chance you like horses?</UTT>I'm not afraid, but my wife is afraid that she is actually in a barn right now.</UTT>Wow, did you realize that Clint Eastwood developed horse allergy? His westerns were so surprising.</UTT>I'd like my wife to get an allergy, it saves us some money. She once told me about that Irish horse with a fifth speed and showed me a video which looked a little strange.</UTT>I'm sure it's a big expense, I honestly don't know if the other horses have four speeds. Very interesting.</UTT>I guess I don't know either. It may be because it's cold in Ireland. That's not as cold as 88 degrees.</UTT>That's insanely cold. Do you know why the Dalmatians are associated with firefighters?</UTT>I suppose they protect the horses. To be honest, I would be happier with a car and only interested in horse power.</UTT>They calmed and protected the horse. I don't know why that particular breed is so special. High school had a day without a vehicle for school so two students rode horses and were suspended. Why did they have a day like that in the first place?</UTT>This day or that is always in school. My kids got to take stuffed animals to school today.</UTT>I remember a lot of weird days, but how are they supposed to get there if no one is allowed to bring a vehicle?</UTT>I want one of those South African cars with flame-throwing in front.</UTT>Why did they do that? That sounds insane.</UTT>I guess it might be a dangerous place. I know the snow won't melt, and doubt they'll get any other than the mountains.</UTT>What a strange car. Do you know that the Cameron was named after the founder of Detroit, Antoine de la Cameron?</UTT>I didn't because the regular Detroit name didn't sound. I heard the name of the trunk coming from an old car with a wood trunk held back.</UTT>iii It's a french explorator, i dont know that sounds like a big pain to have an actual wood trunk.</UTT>Is it cold in you? Not like in Siberia, just regular cold. I have snow at the moment.</UTT>Depends on the season, I have snow at the moment as well. This is off topic, but how do you feel about fish?</UTT>I'm not a fisherman, but I might be interested in them. Seahorses?</UTT>They are fish, and the only ones that actually have necks.</UTT>1

Jfk, Washington and Jefferson are crazy as the richest presidents in American history.</UTT>I can see JFK, but I'm surprised by Washington and Jefferson. I think Washington was just a general before he became president.</UTT>Back then the generals could make a lot back. I also think it's crazy that the president's guest houses are bigger than white ones.</UTT>I know, it seems like it is the other way around. When they build it they can think of themselves as humble or something.</UTT>That is very possible. You know that the runner up was the vice president until 1805.</UTT>I seem to have heard that somewhere before. I like the idea. I think it would make for more viewpoints. What about you?</UTT>I agree with that. That may be an interesting way to do things. You know our Congress is playing a baseball game against the Republicans and Democrats.</UTT>I know that. I remember shooting last year in practice of it, I think. You know they just have 3 subway lines to move between the capital and their offices.</UTT>I don't know about that, but that makes sense. Baseball has been crazy since 1909. That's been a long time to continue having baseball.</UTT>It's really, I think they could do it to try to build camaraderie or something.</UTT>Sport seems to build camaraderie in general, so it makes sense. The Republican Party led with three victories, I'm sure that annoys the Dems.</UTT>I bet it will. Do you know that you can vote for none in the Nevada election?</UTT>I don't know about that, and that kind of seems pointless. I think it's interesting that taller candidates have won the presidential election 75 percent more times since 1900.</UTT>That's interesting. I wonder what happened in 1900 to make the change.</UTT>Back in 1900 people could have been closer in size. As time progressed people seemed to get taller. Walking to middle school made me feel short.</UTT>You may be right. Here's an interesting tidbit: Ancient Athens used to forbid elections because it thought it led to an oligarchy.</UTT>The people from Ancient Athens seem to think the lottery is a better idea. They may be right.</UTT>The more I look at our government today, the more I think they might just be. I guess that means that elections are actually undemocratic.</UTT>It's not like things can be rigged in favor of someone, but the way ancient Athenians did things could just as easily be flawed.</UTT>True, they can just appoint a certain group, as they can now elect.</UTT>I agree.</UTT>Elections have only been around since the 17th century though.</UTT>1

Hello, you're a fan of the hit Hamilton movie. Over 80000 users on the internet are trying to get a ticket for the Hamilton movie on February 28, 2016.</UTT>I'm not. Suggest you. I don't know if it's so popular that people won't get a ticket.</UTT>I'm not a fan either. I'm intrigued by how popular it is. The Kennedy Center, which hosted Hamilton for 14 weeks, just had to change their entire system to satisfy people's desire for tickets. Pretty crazy.</UTT>Many Kennedy Center members even came away without a seat.</UTT>Hard to believe that. $625 ticket is highest and there is a 14% fee for phone and online purchases. I can't imagine paying that for anything.</UTT>I heard people were looking for lines so they could purchase tickets.</UTT>Pretty insane. The process of getting tickets seems controversial because over 70000 people are interested in the tickets, but they can only process 4 to 5000 per hour. That job is insanely stressful.</UTT>You say you can't imagine spending that much money. I can't imagine spending that much time to acquire the ticket either. And the process seems stressed as well.</UTT>No kidding, I sure don't wait for tickets outside in bad weather. especially since you can often find tickets in second hand marketplaces like Craigslist.</UTT>One person spent most of their 27th birthday outside the building to get them. That doesn't sound like my good idea on it.</UTT>I don't thank you much, I much prefer to do other things on my birthday. I guess it's ok to get along with the people in line. One patron said it was the most enjoyable time he'd ever spent. I could do better. I use that time for better things.</UTT>Yeah, when another says it's worth it, one says he's crazy to do it, they can be kidnapped if I say so, but who knows because Hamilton isn't a fan?</UTT>You're a fan of going to movies, I've never even heard of it, only at the box office did Troi Wars budget $1 million and earn around $300,000.</UTT>I'm not really a movie fan, I kind of lost interest in iii. I really like the Disney movies, I like Sleeping Beauty, it's a flop and its almost shut down by Disney's animation studios.</UTT>I've heard that before. I'm a fan of movies, but don't go very often. Who are your favorite actors? Tom Hardy and Tom Hanks I actually love Tom Hardy and Tom Hanks. The highest box office star of all time.</UTT>I really have no pro-actor. Tom Hanks is pretty funny. Did you watch Silence of the Lambs? They have succeeded in the box office.</UTT>I actually read the book too. I find it crazy that a horror movie like that was released on Valentine's Day weekend.</UTT>Yeah, it's impossible to imagine a date where the saying "let's go watch this horror movie for Valentine's Day" would be a good idea.</UTT>Yep, definitely not a romantic date. I guess people enjoy things we never do. We've passed on hours of waiting for tickets and watching gore for the holidays (laughs).</UTT>However, it may have been Valentine's Day, so I don't know.</UTT>I'm not sure where you live, but I always wonder how area codes work. In NY, area code 212 is dialed the fastest with a rotary phone.</UTT>That's pretty cool. I remember having a rotary phone. I think it's past my time, but my parents are too cheap to replace it. Ha!</UTT>1

I use that time for better things.</UTT>Yeah, when another says it's worth it, one says he's crazy to do it, they can be kidnapped if I say so, but who knows because Hamilton isn't a fan?</UTT>You're a fan of going to movies, I've never even heard of it, only at the box office did Troi Wars budget $1 million and earn around $300,000.</UTT>I'm not really a movie fan, I kind of lost interest in iii. I really like the Disney movies, I like Sleeping Beauty, it's a flop and its almost shut down by Disney's animation studios.</UTT>I've heard that before. I'm a fan of movies, but don't go very often. Who are your favorite actors? Tom Hardy and Tom Hanks I actually love Tom Hardy and Tom Hanks. The highest box office star of all time.</UTT>I really have no acting pro. Tom Hanks is pretty funny.</UTT>I actually read the book too. I find it crazy that a horror movie like that was released on Valentine's Day weekend.</UTT>Yeah, it's impossible to imagine a date where the saying "let's go watch this horror movie for Valentine's Day" would be a good idea.</UTT>Yep, definitely not a romantic date. I guess people enjoy things we never do. We've passed on hours of waiting for tickets and watching gore for the holidays (laughs).</UTT>However, it may have been Valentine's Day, so I don't know.</UTT>I'm not sure where you live, but I always wonder how the area code works.</UTT>That's pretty cool. I remember having a rotary phone. I think it's past my time, but my parents are too cheap to replace it. Ha!</UTT>0
I never knew that Hughes Laurie was the highest paid actor in a drama. She got 700k per episode.</UTT>That's so much money, I mean he's still a good actor, I enjoy his shows and the drama in general.</UTT>I never watched the house, I don't understand it being drawn at all.</UTT>Haha, what about the Mad Men with Jon Hmm show? You know he actually taught drama at his old high school one time.</UTT>I see. He's one of his students, Ellie Kemper from the office.</UTT>Wow, I guess the world is small. You also know Michael Caine only joined the drama class because of the girls. He is glad he did, he is a great actor.</UTT>Smart man, Jim Carey also doesn't do drama anymore, he only plays positive projection movies because he believes.</UTT>I can respect that. Funny how we think of drama now. Actually, the term "drama" is dervied from the word "action".</UTT>Cool, I like watching all kinds of shows on NFC these days. From midnight to midnight, NFC accounts for 33 percent of all Internet traffic in North America.</UTT>Wow, I guess everyone watches Netflix. They have 137 million subscribers throughout the world, that's a lot of people who watch the companies.</UTT>True, I love Netfilx. In peak hours, NFC and YouTube represent half of all Internet traffic.</UTT>I don't spend much time on youtube, but wow, I'm amazed at how short the time this company has been around. Nine was founded only in 1997, which is not that long ago really.</UTT>And yeah, Blockbuster could have bought NFC for 50 million and declined offers several times.</UTT>They made a mistake because the corporation now costs $2 billion.</UTT>Yup, I totally forgot that NFC sued for including their DVD rental in their subscriptions. Their players are collecting dust now.</UTT>Interesting, I don't know that. Funny, the NFL actually spends more money on postage than bandwidth.</UTT>Funny, all the NFL complain about having to pay for peering with Internet providers (cable and telco) and being unfairly treated for clogging up bandwidth available on their network.</UTT>I wonder how it will affect companies as they expand outside the US in 2010.</UTT>It's funny how Reed Hastings decided to start Netflix because he got a late $40 fee to rent a VHS movie, so it's pretty late.</UTT>Amazing what inspires people to start a company. I wasn't aware that Netflix actually sold digital discs one time, even though they abandoned them to focus on renting.</UTT>I too love some of their original content. They spent tons of money on that and it paid off. They started producing it in 2012.</UTT>I honestly don't know how long they've been producing their content. I've heard the first series they've produced called a "Lilyhammer". I've never heard of it.</UTT>I've never heard of it either. I love watching Ozark though.</UTT>I'm tired of watching that, but it doesn't benefit me. Well thanks for the chat, I think I'll go watch some netflix.</UTT>1

Hey there, have you ever shopped at Amazon?</UTT>Hello, I use Amazon all the time, shopping there is a lot cheaper, if you don't mind waiting for your item for a few days, then...</UTT>That's true, but they will deliver on Sunday as well if needed.</UTT>Yeah that's helpful, I do most of my Christmas shopping on Amazon, everything is so much cheaper, I got this 7ft beanbag for less than $200 with memory foam in it. Great deal.</UTT>They even own IMDB.</UTT>Oh yeah, based on revenue and market capitalization, it's funny they started out as an online book store and became the world's largest Internet retailer.</UTT>And they are now all the time so busy that warehouse workers walk 7-15 kilometers a day.</UTT>That's not really surprising, I work at a car part factory that delivers parts to the line and pulls pallets at least 15 miles per day. I've heard that Amazon's first customer spends only around $30 and the building is named after them.</UTT>Yeah, not too bad. The Amazon CEO built the clock on a 10,000 year run mountain.</UTT>If I ever saw one, that was Facebook posting. Money making talk. Facebook and Amazon are right up there with that.</UTT>Yeah, have you ever been on MySpace?</UTT>I had one in the early days. I can hardly remember even one to be honest, but I hear that Myspace could buy Facebook in the early days for $75 million and turn it down. Bad business decision.</UTT>That is indeed a bad business. Other countries such as Ireland use Facebook to reach people to rewrite the constitution.</UTT>I think that's just crazy. I mean, good idea, but can't give one company too much persuasion power over people. I know they make posts, but you can't put the right ads there to persuade people the way they want them to go.</UTT>That's true, not sure how they went about it, would you like to read?</UTT>I have nothing against reading. If you don't count bedtime for my son, I just don't read much. I try to read with him before bedtime every night.</UTT>That's really nice. Women hold a speed reading record.</UTT>That's cool, I think her record is 4700 words per minute. I wonder how they actually test it to make sure she reads all she says for the record.</UTT>They can ask her what she read later. That's really fast though.</UTT>Yeah, I said she took a comprehension test to make sure she read that much, but it was fast.</UTT>Sure, nice to chat with you.</UTT>1
Hey there, are you part of the fast pact with Amazon?</UTT>Hello, I use Amazon all the time, shopping there is a lot cheaper, if you don't mind waiting for your item for a few days, then...</UTT>That's true, but they will deliver on Sunday as well if needed.</UTT>That would be any helpful.

Hello, who are you today?</UTT>Great, did you check out the Super Bowl?</UTT>I watched until halftime. It was pretty boring. What about you?</UTT>I watched the whole thing. Looks like the only player who could beat Bay was Eli.</UTT>Yep, I'm a huge New England fan, I really pulled the Rams. Do you know the NFL doesn't have written rules against women players?</UTT>What about Elisha Manning?</UTT>Haha, I can't believe it's an average NFL game that only actually has 11 minutes of gameplay.</UTT>Wow, no matter what Bill Beckinc says, Bradley's injuries are hardly ever a wonder.</UTT>LOL I know.</UTT>Anyway, Eli is definitely Bay's kryptonite.</UTT>That's for sure. I think it's weird that Tom Brady never ate strawberries his entire life.</UTT>Who needs strawberries if you have such a great wife like Giselle?</UTT>LOL, that's a good point!</UTT>She brought the buck home too. She made more than double Tom. Net worth is $400 million.</UTT>They are a very wealthy couple. I don't know if Eli Manning has a genius level IQ.</UTT>Well, I think women are smarter than men.</UTT>LOL, that one isn't sure haha. You know, only 3 teams won the Super Bowl, taken as the 1st overall number, before the NFL was drafted for 20 years.</UTT>Bryan is 50 or something. Kurt Warren has to go to the Cfl. He then comes to the league and wins his first year.</UTT>Yea that's a cool stat.</UTT>almost as odd as the speed limit in the old miss.</UTT>Good to talk to you.</UTT>1

What are you? Any interest in space? I find Mars pretty cool. Roman god of war.</UTT>Hi, what are you? Mars is interesting. There the sounds have a higher pitch than Earth due to the atmosphere.</UTT>It makes sense to have a very thin atmosphere.</UTT>The sunset on Mars is blue, I wonder who wants to be part of the colonization project in 2023?</UTT>Well, I know lichens and cyanobacteria thrive on Mars, so I'm sure they'd like to go.</UTT>They may be the first to go. We need to work out the kinks in the system. Lockheed Martin still uses a foot and a mile and caused the satellite to crash.</UTT>LOL, it's bad that Lochet Martin used the imperial system when the Nasa used metric.</UTT>Who uses the empire system? NASA is American and uses metric.</UTT>I don't even really see how even a satellite can be launched if Lokheed uses an empire system.</UTT>NASA probably handled the launch, Lockheed handled the release of the satellites from Mars. I don't know which solar system is second in size. I wonder if it's a comfortable place to live.</UTT>Probably not all iron oxides that give it its reddish apperance.</UTT>Because of the thin atmosphere it has that. It only takes 2-3 days to get to Mars at a gallons of acclimation. I wonder if that will happen to us soon with technology.</UTT>I don't know. I guess the US government isn't at least close yet according to Wikileaks. They all published their plans to destroy it.</UTT>Wikileaks is really a thorn in the side of the US government. The US government owns 86 percent of Nevada's land. I wonder how much it's worth.</UTT>I don't know. A man who sells government officials twice and sells the Eiffel might try to sell it.</UTT>He should be a politician.</UTT>Or he may try to act and maybe audition for the President, and probably do the audition better than Reagan did.</UTT>LOL I wonder what's behind the US legislation protecting government employees from violating the Geneva Convention. Sounds fishy.</UTT>I guess the US doesn't want their military in a UN or Geneva jurisdiction.</UTT>I guess the government plans an atrocity or something. I would like the Norwegian government to donate to help save the Amazon.</UTT>But I hope more countries contribute too, because Norway's 1 trillion doesn't seem to be enough.</UTT>It's not. And Norway has tons of money from petroleum. Guess the environmental problems caused by oil. Norway acknowledges its responsibility.</UTT>I guess so, well I have to go. Nice to talk to you.</UTT>1

Good Morning, are you a football fan?</UTT>Hi there, I really don't enjoy it, but I went to a big SEC football college so I was familiar enough with it.</UTT>Sure the SEC loves their football, schools have to bring in some much money for that game.</UTT>They do it mostly because of broadcast rights. The acting behind the scenes can be pretty interesting too, like painting the locker room of the University of Iowa visitors pink.</UTT>I wonder if they think it gives them a psychological advantage. I can't see that working though.</UTT>If anything it would give the visiting teams more motivation, would I wonder if teams from other countries who are in football are trying similar tactics?</UTT>At the highest level of sport, I think athletes are so tuned in that they can only throw off because of a mistake or ref.</UTT>For example, Patriots quarterback Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled in his NFL career.</UTT>That's an amazing stat, and he has one of the best nicknames ever.</UTT>That is certainly interesting. Is that referring to his ability to offend?</UTT>It's because his name sounds like a law firm. Ben-Jarvis Green-Ellis' law.</UTT>Yeah, that makes a confusing name for a broadcast program on the air if people think it's an advertisement especially on radio.</UTT>It does. It's just not used a ton to bring a little humor to the broadcast.</UTT>It is probably easier to read on a platform like a name. I don't think they have any character limitations.</UTT>I've never really explored that, my name is not very long, so I've never run into that issue.</UTT>The site has some interesting quirks, such as Mark Zimmerberg is green-blind to red, so it is primary blue.</UTT>I remember a NFL game where two teams were wearing red and green jerseys. A lot of people who suffered from that complained because they couldn't tell the two teams.</UTT>That's funny, maybe that's part of why home teams wear white a lot of the time. I don't think many NBA teams have green as their color, but a lot of teams have red like the Ohio State.</UTT>This is a special game where they test a color rush jersey in one primary color. That's why so many people have trouble with no color breaks or noticeable logos.</UTT>I guess some of their choices are to make things easier for viewers, like espn actually won the Emmy because the first yellow line shown down on TV was superimposed.</UTT>That was a great invention that made it a lot easier to watch the game. It's fun to talk football to yourself. Have a great day.</UTT>1

Do you like going to movies?</UTT>Crazy Asians are good.</UTT>I've seen that movie, I think it's also pretty funny. It's typically a romantic comedy type stuff.</UTT>What other movies do you like?</UTT>I usually like fantasy or science fiction movies. Big box office hits most.</UTT>I think the comedy film was great too. I was surprised by Evan almighty.</UTT>I like comedy, Bill Murray is my favorite actor.</UTT>You know, Evan almighty is the most expensive comedy film to be made.</UTT>Do you know that 3rd Rock from the Sun beat Seinfeld for the Golden Globe Award?</UTT>I don't know what article that is from.</UTT>I'm not sure. But Silence of the Lambs came out on Valentine's Day. That's crazy.</UTT>Wow, was that purposefully done?</UTT>I wouldn't take a kind of movie from someone on Valentine's Day.</UTT>I thought it was funny that Green Lantern was supposed to star Jack Black.</UTT>Wow, I never thought of that. Where did you read that?</UTT>Here's a section on facts:</UTT>Interesting about Hollywood. Do you know Tom Hanks is the highest box office star of all time?</UTT>I do. He has many cool movies.</UTT>Are you a fan of the Disney movies?</UTT>Oh my god, I didn't wait for all the remakes.</UTT>Actually Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty was bombed in the box office.</UTT>Well, nice to talk to you.</UTT>Same.</UTT>Bye now.</UTT>1

Hi, what do you think of the President?</UTT>Hey, thanks, good for you. I think the job is very stressful. Heading the government is not an easy task.</UTT>It's not easy. Everyone guesses you second and everyone complains. I don't want a job.</UTT>Yes, I am as well. Too much stress. I wonder how bananas do to a first president in Zimbabwe.</UTT>If the guy isn't totally corrupt, then that must be a terrible job.</UTT>Agreed. Do you know that guest houses for Presidents are bigger than white houses?</UTT>I bet that arrangement would be very pleasing to Trump. He probably could rent out a guest house. Put a guest sign on it. LOL</UTT>Haha, I can see that. Fox News is likely to cover that story. They once thought of creating a channel that only airs The Simpsons.</UTT>That's overkill, the whole channel is not necessary, they can just set up a website.</UTT>Exactly. You should work for Fox News (laughs out loud). * Republican media strategist Richard Ailes created Fox News Network.</UTT>Yeah, he and Nixon decided they needed conservative ideas on the air. I guess it's a propaganda machine.</UTT>Unfortunately it wasn't. It was surprising that it was broadcast in 86 countries.</UTT>I guess they changed it around to local content but people want to hear about the US. I don't know how many people believe what they hear, but they watch.</UTT>They did. They even threatened to sue Simpsons even though they wanted to make their own channel.</UTT>I think the right hand doesn't know what the far right hand is doing there.</UTT>Definitly. That channel covers quite a bit of the US Senate. I think it would be interesting if each state had two senators regardless of population.</UTT>They have a lot of power too. Much more than the representatives. Six years plus lots of support.</UTT>Well, Richard Nixon cracked the gavel the Senate used for 165 years. He was either strong or weak.</UTT>He is determined and wants to bust that gavel. Many people try and fail but he succeeds. Anyway, great chat.</UTT>Crazy women couldn't wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993. But great chat too. Have a great night my friend.</UTT>Have a good night.</UTT>Bye.</UTT>1

You should work for Fox News (laughs out loud). * Republican media strategist Richard Ailes created Fox News Network.</UTT>Yeah, he and Nixon decided they needed conservative ideas on the air. I guess it's a propaganda machine.</UTT>Unfortunately it wasn't. It was surprising that it was broadcast in 86 countries.</UTT>I guess they changed it around to local content but people want to hear about the US. I don't know how many people believe what they hear, but they watch.</UTT>They did. They even threatened to sue Simpsons even though they wanted to make their own channel.</UTT>I think the right hand doesn't know what the far right hand is doing there.</UTT>Definitely. The whole channel covers quite a bit of the US Senate. I would however say that the website as well knows two senators regardless of population.</UTT>They have a lot of power too. Much more than the representatives. Six years plus lots of support.</UTT>Well, Richard Nixon cracked the gavel the Senate used for 165 years. He said or not.</UTT>He is determined and wants to bust that gavel. Many people try and fail but he succeeds. Anyway, great chat.</UTT>Crazy women couldn't wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993. But great chat too. Have a great night my friend.</UTT>Have a good night.</UTT>Bye.</UTT>0
Watch Johnny English Strikes Again?</UTT>Is that a film about Mr. Bean?</UTT>Yeah, the one is the same because it has Mr. Bean as the lead actor.</UTT>I didn't see it, was it any good?</UTT>I haven't seen it either, the first part was really funny, so I could watch the sequel. I think it will wait until it comes out at least on Bluerray or Netflix.</UTT>Cool. I can check it out, but did you see that new horror series The Kingdom on Netflix?</UTT>I don't see them. As for The Kingdom, what?</UTT>It's about zombies, like zombies?</UTT>Real zombies, sure the name doesn't fit the description, in fact I'm not much of a fan. I hate horror films.</UTT>I love them, NFC have such a huge collection and I can't stop watching them.</UTT>Well, it's good you like them, you can burn a lot of calories just watching a horror film.</UTT>That's new to me. Do you know that E.T. was originally supposed to be a horror movie?</UTT>It's good, E.T. is one of my favorite fellows. Do you like abstract art? Pay attention after watching the movie and you'll like it more.</UTT>I don't much like abstract art, but I see it everywhere on facebook.</UTT>Oh, I see, how long do you have a facebook account?</UTT>I really stopped using it lately for about a year because 33% of all divorces filed in 2011 contained the word facebook.</UTT>I guess Facebook makes couples fight each other and also uses it to rewrite countries constitutions like Ireland.</UTT>30% of American adults get their news there as well.</UTT>I see, do you know that MySpace is offering to buy Facebook for 75 million dollars?</UTT>No, but I know more people on facebook than in the world 200 years ago.</UTT>That really makes sense. Now almost everyone has an account.</UTT>1

I recently learned that McDonalds added drive thrus for soldiers who couldn't get out of their car in fatigued clothes.</UTT>That's very nice of them and I think it might benefit us all now. I love drive thrus. Not just McDonalds, but I like Walgreens and CVS too.</UTT>Yeah, I bet it won't take long for everyone else to say they want to use drive thrus too.</UTT>Right, mom, who has millions of children, especially a million like i laughed out loud!</UTT>LOL True, hey, do you know how your car trunk gets its name?</UTT>That large trunk that people used to keep their clothes and belongings tied to the back of the car. What a hassle. LOL</UTT>Building a real truck to your car is definitely better than a wood truck tied down the back.</UTT>I know right, my grandfather had a bunch of ridiculously heavy trunks.</UTT>Do you know this crazy fact that it is legal in South Africa to have flamethrowers in your car to prevent them from being jacked?</UTT>That's crazy, and there must be serious problems. Is there no other way to protect your car? That's really extreme lol.</UTT>It's iii. What could be wrong with gas tanks and flame throwers?</UTT>LOL, you're right, my reaction was totally over. That might come in handy in a snowy area though.</UTT>We just got 4 more inches of snow here. I could use one for my driveway.</UTT>Nice, who do you live with among us? I'm in Ca and dumped in tahoe, I could use a flame thrower to go snowboarding on my day trip! LOL!</UTT>Maine, I'm ready for spring. The snow was nice in December, but by March I was sick of it.</UTT>I've heard that I don't live in the snow but can see how annoying it is to dig your car into the snow (how cold has it been lately?</UTT>It wasn't bad that the highs of the past few days were around 30 but after the week they were around zero.</UTT>Yikes, that's cold. Do you have a good ski or snowboard there in Maine?</UTT>I'm in the west coast of Maine, but closer to the coast. I'd love to go to the ocean in the summer.</UTT>Oh, I didn't see all the crabs there, lol.</UTT>Yeah, do you know that a con man in France pretending to be a government official sold the Eiffel Tower?</UTT>Yeah, that guy has to be super convincing lol.</UTT>1
That's what McDonalds has recently had to add to us for the soldiers who get in their car unwound and wear fatigue.</UTT>That's very nice of them and I think it might benefit us all now.

Hey you a Trump fan?</UTT>Hi, that's a hard question. I think he's arrogant and a jerk, but I like some of his ideas.. you?</UTT>This is not genius he talks about, sorry he is a complete idiot. I'm too.</UTT>Haha, you know the only US president with a doctorate?</UTT>I don't know what it is.</UTT>Woodrow Wilson</UTT>That's so interesting you expect more. Do you know JFK, Washington and Jefferson are the richest people ever?</UTT>Wow, do you know what our planet's alternative name is?</UTT>I'm not sure what the blue planet is.</UTT>It is also known as telus and teluris except for Gaia.</UTT>That's interesting, do you know that the planet is considered to be in orbit on Jupiter's Ganymede moon?</UTT>Wow, that's pretty cool. Do you know that you can fit every other planet between the Earth and the Moon?</UTT>I don't know that. Blows my mind. I know astronomers have detected building blocks of life in systems 455 light years away.</UTT>Wow, planets also orbit 4 stars.</UTT>Wow, I bet they think the whole world is orbiting them in North Korea. Kim Jong-un probably told them that.</UTT>That's funny, I'm not too familiar with him. I know he's young, but he was born on 8 January 1983.</UTT>The onion voted him the sexiest man in life, which is a complete joke, but China believes it.</UTT>Hahaha gross. He is the grandson of the first North Korean leader.</UTT>Yea, he's a complete lunatic and killed off most of his family.</UTT>That's sad, I wonder how long he's been in leadership.</UTT>Hope it's not long and I'll have a good chat with you.</UTT>1

Jordan Peele's "Get Out" film truly deserves the Oscar nomination, in my opinion. After all, as a writer and director he has made history.</UTT>Yes, have you seen that movie?</UTT>I have and love it. Hard to believe Peele was nominated for the 5th black director. That's insane.</UTT>I assume that has to do with the limited opportunities black directors have in Hollywood. I wonder how many great films we miss out on because of racism.</UTT>That's so true, Peele, the African American writer, is also the first African American writer to be nominated for the best original screenplay nearly 25 years later. He's broken down the racial barrier in this way.</UTT>He's a really talented person Key gives him a lot of credit for Key and Peele's success.</UTT>I agree, are you a chance to fan of horror movies? I enjoyed them, you can burn up to 180 calories watching just one?</UTT>Wow, I don't like them, but I incorporate them into my workout.</UTT>Sure it worked out great, Stephen King said heck, the first horror movie he ever watched as a kid was "Bambi" and he was terrified. That's kinda funny.</UTT>I remember being really upset when I watched it with my parents. I don't think they knew that was coming when we watched it. Iii</UTT>I've never seen it to be honest. I should have one of these days. I can find it on Netflix. I'm one of many North Americans who contribute to Netflix and account for 33 percent of all bandwidth after midnight each night.</UTT>You also use YouTube?</UTT>Yeah, I also contributed to Youtube and NFC, which account for half of the peak internet traffic.</UTT>Blockbuster turned down a 50 million dollar NFC deal. What a bad decision.</UTT>I know, huge mistake considering NFC is worth $2 Billion now, you know they have to live with that mistake forever?</UTT>And only one blockbuster left in the US. It's in Alaska. It seems to be a huge problem for them. I wonder if their website is still up?</UTT>That's a great question. Glad Reed Hastings has a $40 late fee because we probably don't have Netflix today. So you're in the history of the Academy Awards?</UTT>None of this could have happened without Eve's annoyance. Thank you for the rudeness of the blockbuster.</UTT>What a true story, I'm also glad NFC started releasing their series of lilyhammer. The actors in their films could beat Daniel Day-Lewis' best acting record at the Oscars.</UTT>Waldo Disney has 22 awards that's a record.</UTT>Indeed, it's extremely hard to believe that. It's also crazy to know that Eminem won the Oscars more than Bill Murray, Leo, Will Smith, Depp and Lucas combined.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>1

Good afternoon for you. Do you very often use google? It was founded in 1998?</UTT>Hello, I find myself using google extremely often. I'm always online one way or another and look things up constantly.</UTT>Wow, too. A single search on Google requires more compute power than it takes to send Neil Armstrong to the moon!</UTT>That statement is amazing. I must think that and what was primitive back then. It's wild to have so much compute power at our fingertips.</UTT>We are so lucky, Google even determined traffic for us by tracking our Android phones.</UTT>I recently read that Google is figuring out traffic patterns based on how fast phones are moving around the world. I think it's kind of fun to visualize the figures out. I'm amused by that.</UTT>Visualization is very fun. Google even uses goats to eat/trim their lawn around headquarters.</UTT>That really gets my goats. How cute. I wonder if Google did that to make them seem personable, quirky, friendly and something like that?</UTT>I'd like to know the reasoning as well. In 2013, Google went down for about 5 minutes and took 40% of web traffic. That went to show how many people used Google.</UTT>It's so ubiquitous I have many privacy concerns. Its owner Alphabet heads up the Sundar Pikai conglomerate, which is such a huge corporate conglomerate.</UTT>I'm concerned about privacy as well. Google has a lot of power. When border disputes occur, Google maps tailors its maps to each country where the Internet browser is located.</UTT>I find that fascinating. The implication is enormous. They are so deeply involved in our lives. I'm concerned about that, but that's what it says. I just bought a new phone today, which is a true story.</UTT>They really are. Congratulations on the new phone, hook your phone up to your car. In the 20th century, cars came first when they were used globally.</UTT>I don't own a car right now, i'm essentially using Uber or Lyft on my phone, iie have to have the latest google branded phone, it's too old and heats up too much.</UTT>Oh, nice to have that at least. Hope this one stays cool. Play video games on your phone. John Marshallborough became a race car driver by beating people at Gran Turismo.</UTT>I love playing word games (most word games) I am a wordy type person, a reader, and a lifelong learner at least. The technology available gives it absolutely stunning and beautiful on my phone and home computer.</UTT>Oh that's cool. You know that the trunk of a car is called a boot because the old car used to have an actual wood trunk in the back.</UTT>Maybe they should have thought that when they invented cars back in 1886. People obviously want to take their stuff everywhere they go.</UTT>Very cool. I think Mercedes is a prestige brand because its creators are known as the inventors of modern cars. Great chat with you today.</UTT>I really enjoyed it. I'm so happy to get my new phone today and I can travel more safely and securely now. Can't imagine traveling without it, can't I?</UTT>Nope, I definitely can't. My phone is in my car and everywhere I go. Have a good one thanks for the chat again. Bye</UTT>If you want to live in a modern world, you really have no choice. Thank you.</UTT>I see you!</UTT>1

I learned that people on CNN thought Kellyanne Conway was wrong when she said there was no evidence of collusion. That's a big surprise to the CNN people.</UTT>Well, I hope I don't enter politics, but I think Kellyane Conway is a political figure.</UTT>Yes, she's a spokesperson, I suppose the researchers want to see how we handle the subject, 4 of the 10 Trump supporters got news on FOX. That's also what it means to not do, it's a source that describes the loyalty of 6 of them.</UTT>I'm surprised by the topic today. Do you know that JFK, Washington and Jefferson are the wealthiest? I wonder how JFK made his money?</UTT>JFK inherited it. His dad sold liquor during prohibition by importing it from Europe. I don't think Trump was one of the top three like in 1805 when the vice president came in second.</UTT>Hahahahahahaha glad you know me. Well liquor sales then seem to pay off. Like drug sales now?</UTT>I don't think it looks down quite as much. It's illegal also the banana calling of the president of the country is amusing.</UTT>I wonder why the Zimbabwean president chose the word banana, and I wonder too why the president's hours are larger than the White House? Will more status be given?</UTT>I suspect it had to do with the time it was built. The White House is very old. Imagine a cable channel that only broadcast The Simpsons.</UTT>Haha my ex husband loves it, would you like to purchase from Amazon lol?</UTT>I'm a member of the Prime organization and shop there several times a month. Imagine being the first customer and getting the building name for yourself.</UTT>Cool package delivered to my door for life free. I don't know if Ali Baba is richer than Amazon.</UTT>The market in China is just so large and will be potentially larger as the nation's wealth grows. I admire Bezos for growing Amazon from just a book.</UTT>I admire him for the ideas he has. I love the people who work in the Amazon warehouse, I need to lose weight, walking 7 or 15 miles a day is wonderful, I get paid thinner.</UTT>I live in Phoenix so I hope the warehouse is cool in the air. They are now making their own shows to stream like Netflix.</UTT>That's so cool, I love NFC too. It's amazing to me that USP is just working with Amazon to deliver the package on Sunday. A strong company.</UTT>Great fortune for the Post Office. Regular mail volume goes down due to email, and the volume of packages being delivered to Amazon increases a lot.</UTT>You're pretty intelligent, I happen to own a kindle fire and just love it. You can read somebody's history, you can actually see places, you can listen to music somebody's listening to. A marvellous gadget.</UTT>Wow, I don't know how Kindle can do so much. Nowadays our computing power is only so great that our imaginations are limited. It's surprising that newer companies come up with innovations and older companies try to keep selling buggy whips.</UTT>I highly recommend it to you, I read about the Spanish Queen Juana the Creasy, they mentioned the Alhambra and the songs people listen to and it makes you feel more like it, it gives you an excellent impression.</UTT>Thanks, I enjoyed it too.</UTT>1

That's a vice-versa surprise from the people's market for CNN.</UTT>Well, I hope I don't enter politics, but I think Kellyane Conway is a political figure.</UTT>Yes, she's a spokesperson, I suppose the researchers want to see how we handle the subject.

Have you heard any good albums lately?</UTT>I love The Darkside of the Moon. The Darkside of the Moon was a 2014 bestseller despite being released over 40 years ago.</UTT>That's a great album, like the Linkin Park band?</UTT>It's a great album. I like Linkin Park. What do you do?</UTT>I also like the band. My favorite album is The Hybrid Theory. There are a lot of good songs on that album.</UTT>I heard that was the most sold album of the 21st century.</UTT>Really nice album, best selling, and I love that band for God's sake.</UTT>Can you believe that NWA's album "Straight Outta Compton" reached platinum status for the first time without the band on the tour?</UTT>It's iii. I think that's a really good album. I really like it. I guess the group has many fans.</UTT>It certainly gained the attention it needed. I was surprised that two identical 100 year old twins put out a rap album in 1992.</UTT>I guess it never is too late to follow your dreams, but I wonder if they made a music video for one of their songs.</UTT>If they do, it's fun to see them. I wonder if they're recognized like Tupac. His music in the Liberal Congress is culturally significant.</UTT>I guess Pac is one of those artists too great to die at a young age and the way he does.</UTT>True legend. Before he became a rapper, Eminem dreamed of being a comic book artist. I would love to see any of his art.</UTT>I wonder if he is a talent and do you know Busta Rhymes?</UTT>I heard of him. Why?</UTT>He voiced the "Retar Wagon" in the movie "Rugrats," which premiered back in 1998.</UTT>Oh, I never knew that. Now that I know, I'll have to watch it again. Is it crazy that the MI judge rules Eminem's trial in a rap version?</UTT>That's crazy, and also really unprofessional. I bet she was ground for that. A rule like that could be biased.</UTT>I'm not sure. It was long ago in 2001. Who knows what the rules are.</UTT>You have a good point, I think I'm going to google it now. Your chat today was awesome.</UTT>Nice to chat with you too. Thanks.</UTT>1

Hello, do you have a pet?</UTT>I don't own a pet, I like dogs though, do you own a pet?</UTT>I have dogs, the 12 different types of blood are interesting, my dogs donate and I have never known this fact.</UTT>I heard a dog was driving blood. I guess the leg dog is OK with needles in it.</UTT>I guess so. Some of them may be afraid. You know Google prefers dogs over cats.</UTT>Dogs are probably easier to manage in office space. Cats don't stay put.</UTT>I agree, but when cats reach the age of 15, they spend like 66 percent of their lives sleeping, while 10 out of 15 spend 15.</UTT>They are easy to manage in sleep. When awake they wander and explore. If they sit on a computer and surf the Internet, cats are great. Istanbul has a vending machine that rewards dogs for collecting recycled bottles.</UTT>I wonder if that is an effective system, I think it might work and there is a way to sure reduce costs.</UTT>I have never been to a cat cafe, Japan and Taiwan, many countries. I guess the cats get along with each other and have no problem with people trying to pet them.</UTT>I guess cats are popular in that country. Authors publish their cats as co-authors of their books.</UTT>I think he wants to use our words on paper so he includes his cat in the author. I wonder how cats get into town mayors.</UTT>LOL I bet other politicians are really bad and I still think Mayor Stubbs is doing better work than most.</UTT>Cats can't really do much harm, they sleep most of the time and hunt the rest of the time. Cats eliminate bird species in specific areas, and even cause them to be extinct.</UTT>They have. Wow, that's a surprise. You know the cat in Godfather 1 was actually a stray cat.</UTT>The cat behaves pretty well, I don't think he'll ever be called the best man friend, but he sure comes close.</UTT>I don't think that either, you know dogs aren't actually color blind, and they can also see the colors, but they don't see them the way we do.</UTT>I'm not surprised. I suspect many animals can see colors just like human beings. I expect cats can see colors as well.</UTT>I saw and I didn't know cats could see colors also, which surprised me.</UTT>Cats also probably have many different blood types. I wonder if they have the same blood drive as dogs?</UTT>I bet there are a lot of cat lovers so it's really probably.</UTT>1

Hi, do you know much about animals?</UTT>Yes, you know how many animals there are individually?</UTT>200,000,000,000, but don't ask me what the zeros are in that number.</UTT>Haha I know, do you have a pet?</UTT>I do. Do you know that they can develop white patches on the forehead?</UTT>But I don't see them on my pets so I'm not sure that.</UTT>Yeah, I guess. The Constitution protects animals in Germany.</UTT>I like that we should adopt laws like that here too.</UTT>Yeah, I agree. Do you know why we have hiccups?</UTT>They are just holdovers when the animals have lung and gills.</UTT>Yeah, you know so much about humans?</UTT>Yeah, I know we lost our hair just 25 million years ago.</UTT>Yeah, you know why we've run good on persistence?</UTT>Because we used to be hunters and we are hunters.</UTT>Yeah, do you know we can regrow ribs?</UTT>The out body will be just as strong in just 2 months.</UTT>I know, but the frequency scares us.</UTT>I'm curious, but I wonder how it sounds.</UTT>Yeah, I'm actually, too. Do you know that we can't only synthesize and do that?</UTT>All other animals have that ability. Do you know why?</UTT>They have the right enzyme to help them do that.</UTT>1
You actually do too much about animals?</UTT>Yes, you know how many animals there are individually?</UTT>2 billion, but don't know the zero in that number to me.</UTT>Haha I know, do you have a pet?</UTT>I do.

Do you like basketball?</UTT>I do. The Golden State Warriors are my favorite team. What about you?</UTT>I like the Lakers.</UTT>Do you know that the Golden State Warriors are planning to move to San Francisco?</UTT>Any particular reasons?</UTT>I'm not sure, there might be financial incentives to move there, do you know why?</UTT>Not sure.</UTT>You are a pro basketball player. My Stephen Curry.</UTT>Ah, Stephen Curry was a great choice.</UTT>Do you know that he did not receive any scholarships to any major college?</UTT>What a shame he performed on such a great shooter.</UTT>I agree, Stephen Curry also wanted to play at Virginia Tech back then.</UTT>I wonder if Akron Ohio is a basketball state. There were Lebron James and Stephen Curry born there.</UTT>I assume so. Both those players are star players, and one of the best players the world has to offer.</UTT>I agree, it's a shame that Curry makes the highest fifth salary.</UTT>He should go and renew his contract with another team. I'm sure many teams out there are willing to pay him a large sum of money.</UTT>True, but who knows how he will perform on another team?</UTT>Stephen Curry agrees that he has very good synergies with his current team.</UTT>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to chat.</UTT>Thanks too, it's a lot of fun!</UTT>Have a wonderful day.</UTT>1

The President sure did an important job.</UTT>LOL Some might say he did a bad job in an important job. It's too bad there wasn't a backup to balance his worse impulses. The vice president became secretary Hillary Clinton until 1805.</UTT>She's a mess as vice president because she doesn't get along with Trump and both have opposing views.</UTT>Trump is a reality star. He may prefer to stick to entertainment by releasing some pop albums like the Indonesian president.</UTT>I know right, and if he means to leave office I should support him.</UTT>He could make more money for his supporters by selling albums. God knows he isn't as rich as he says. Actually, Presidents JFK, Washington and Jefferson.</UTT>He has filled many bankruptcies, so that makes sense, and JFK is the richest man in history?</UTT>I'm sure he's on top 3 for his family, not in slavery like you make much money as a congressman or senator like he is.</UTT>At least not enough to beat the other two, interesting facts about the Senate, and the Senate did not allow women to wear pants on the floor until 1993.</UTT>They are sticklers for tradition. You know they used the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon cracked it. Haha, that seems like a sign of omen.</UTT>ii) It's done (lol) * The candy desk tradition began in 1968 * that's a tasty and sweet tradition!</UTT>Yes, it is, but some people aren't big on tradition. Teddy Roosevelt was so into conservatism that he banned Christmas trees from the White House.</UTT>He banned them terrible? It was a tradition of many important ones.</UTT>Some people hate the move forward too. Reagan removed the solar panels Carter installed in the White House, but eventually George W. Bush had some put back.</UTT>Bush is a good place to place them back. Solar energy is the future. Did you hear about the Secret Service incident in 2011?</UTT>Crazy it took 4 days before they realized the bullet had struck the White House.</UTT>4 days are really crazy. I bet someone was fired that day.</UTT>I wonder how they would not fire people who allowed the use of floppy drives to store some of the files in the White House to stay. It might be for data security.</UTT>I think it was for data security, so one of those ones must have been difficult to hack.</UTT>Yeah, it's not easy to copy them. Do you know that the White House is actually a copycat in Ireland and France?</UTT>I don't know about that. They must be interesting buildings, and I wonder if they have the same size as the White House, and I also wonder who lives there.</UTT>1

Hey, you heard about baseball players who died in WWII?</UTT>I haven't heard of a ballplayer who died in World War II. I'm a huge baseball fan and would like to learn more. Good evening.</UTT>He was named Eddie Grant and was actually in the World Series back in 1913.</UTT>The history of baseball is fascinating. Stories like this are always waiting to be told out there. I know they will cancel the season so the players can fight, but I don't know much about Ted Williams.</UTT>I didn't follow it that deep. The Cubs were the first team to win back to back World Series. They were impressive.</UTT>They have a pretty long drought after back-back too. I'm pretty excited to start this season, I'm in a few spring training games and going to another Saturday.</UTT>This season should definitely be interesting. I'm shocked that the Women's World Cup is rated higher than the World Series because I don't know a person who watches soccer personally.</UTT>We watched it because my daughter played and Alex Morgan was a grrrrreat. We also watched the man wc and of course the World Series and went to tons more baseball games than soccer but we didn't have a man league team.</UTT>hahahaha well for each. Personally I don't watch baseball, but it's crazy that a baseball manager can actually play for a team if needed. That's why they wear uniforms.</UTT>Yep, and I've seen the umpires check the manager's uniform under his jacket to make sure everything is copacetic (I'll show you the ump) * Peter Rose, the last true player I can remember, and today is actually never.</UTT>Haha that's cool, what do you think Canadians call kickball soccer, that name seems really dumb, haha.</UTT>seems clunky, I think kickball makes pretty accurate descriptions of the sport, why don't they call hockey soccer "ice skating with sticks"?</UTT>Haha, I like that idea, you used to think combining husband and wife with the MLB, they schedule about 2500 games a year, I bet they are busy all the time.</UTT>I think the computer set up the schedule because so much is tracked, travel time, and geography logistics. It hurts the brain to think that the computer set up the schedule for 30 teams and 162.</UTT>Haha, that's enough to keep track of that. BTW, do you use the telephone? I bet they definitely have to schedule their own games.</UTT>I have an iphone that's been glued to my right hand all the time. The compute power we have on the smartphone is amazing compared to the mega computers of the past three decades.</UTT>I just use my cell phone mostly. I don't have landlines anymore, but the cell phone cable is about 3 inches thick stretching across the ocean.</UTT>I don't think they need to run cable anywhere in the world today with wireless technology and satellites?</UTT>Yeah that's strange. Personally, I'm scared of something that happens on cable. You also know your iPhone actually has more compute power than the entire nuclear deterrent system in the United States. Haha, that's scary.</UTT>I bet the iPhone has more compute power than a desktop running Windows XP.</UTT>LOL Good point, great to talk to you and make sure you donate a minute to UNICEF that you don't use cell phones. UNICEF gives children clean, free water at a rate you don't use cell phones.</UTT>1

Do you know much about the White House?</UTT>Have you visited there? Bush put on solar panels.</UTT>I've obviously visited it from the outside. There are similar buildings in France and Ireland too.</UTT>I think someone in America would also build a similar one?</UTT>That's not known where. When Roosevelt was in the house, he didn't allow Christmas trees.</UTT>I really think that's because he's a staunch conservationist. Hard to believe they still use floppy disks. They probably decorated trees outside and everywhere else at that time.</UTT>Yeah, I think floppy discs are still safer for some reason, do you know that the White House was hit in November 2011?</UTT>Makes sense, yeah, it took 4 days to find the bullet hit the White House. Enjoy your travels?</UTT>Right, I love it, have you ever been to Japan?</UTT>No, I heard it was very crowded. The highway was a toll and the travel across the country was a bit quiet.</UTT>Traveling across can cost as much as $300 and quite a bit.</UTT>Do you know that air travel is 10 percent slower than in the 60's to save fuel costs?</UTT>Oh cool, the Dutch work on a bus that could actually go 160 mph.</UTT>That's interesting to ride on. Island does not have public toll services. Most people who don't use cars use domestic flights. Reminds me of the Virgin Islands who fly from island to island.</UTT>It's a small country, so flights have to be short too. They don't allow motorized vehicles on Michigan Island.</UTT>You really know that the ship released the rabbits from the island in the age of discovery to provide future food to other travelers. I love rabbits so much, but I know they have to eat.</UTT>That's true. Do you know that the King was the first one to travel the world?</UTT>Hawaii King Kalakaua I'm surprised by that. I love volcanoes, when we were on a big island we went to a volcano area. All the lava rocks were very cool.</UTT>Nice, would love to go someday. Do you use the internet much?</UTT>I seem to be in it all the time. I can believe that only 7% read full term when I buy services. Oh goodness, it's so long. I'm trying to go over the basics.</UTT>Oh they are super long too, it takes forever, nice to chat with you.</UTT>1
Do you know much about the White House?</UTT>Have you visited there? Bush put on solar panels.</UTT>People really visited it from outside. There are similar buildings in France and Ireland too.</UTT>I think someone in America would also build a similar one?</UTT>That's not known where. When Roosevelt was in the house, he didn't allow Christmas trees.</UTT>I really think that's because he's a staunch conservationist. Hard to believe they still use floppy disks. They probably decorated trees outside and everywhere else at that time. Didn't you visit there?

Do you like dancing? I like watching beautiful choreographed moves, but I am not good at dancing.</UTT>I'm not too good at dancing, but I'm trying. I used to try to replicate Michael Jackson's moves, but it didn't go over too well for me.</UTT>Haha, that's funny. I assume you don't have his special patent device.</UTT>I'm sure that doesn't make me mad to find out he uses that. I busted myself in the face so often to try and do that.</UTT>At least you know now. Even when babies hear music they dance spontaneously.</UTT>I see that a lot. I work in a child hospital. We have these new infant warming/incubation things in our NICUs that you can hook into your phone or play mp3 music. It's cute to see babies moving around and dancing while playing with their friends.</UTT>Oh, that's cool technology that the NICU has. Even Pac did a dance and did a ballet in high school.</UTT>That's pretty interesting. I guess that was before he started getting involved with the gang.</UTT>So it is.</UTT>I agree with that, haha, and Bruce Lee also did a great dance.</UTT>He's surprised, do you like to wear a hat? NICUs don't generally wear hats, the most popular hat in the Old West is a bowler.</UTT>I usually wear a baseball hat when I'm not working. I wish I could wear a top hat like a British politician would have to wear a hat at a point in the House of Commons.</UTT>They actually did that until 1998.</UTT>That's pretty funny. Do you know that the hatpin limit law was passed in 1908?</UTT>Interesting. I wonder if using them as weapons by suffragettes is a big problem.</UTT>I think that's why. I hate being stabbed with a hat pin.</UTT>That's not fun. The knight actually raised his face visor to show his friendliness and the phrase "Tip your hat" came from it.</UTT>That's pretty intersting, do you know where the dunce cap originated?</UTT>That's a hat worn at a party to encourage foolish behavior? Sounds like what alcohol does, well, chatting with you is fun.</UTT>Alcohol added to a dunce cap is right equal to a double dunce haha nice chat too</UTT>Have a good one.</UTT>1

Who are you today? You don't like watching TV.</UTT>I do. I really like that 1970s show, but the UK doesn't like the show apparently. They created the same show verbatim but it was canceled after 10 episodes.</UTT>That's a great show, I'm surprised it flopped there.</UTT>I agree. Some shows have really been successful, like pokemon which has been on for over 16 years.</UTT>I heard there were over 750 shows of pokemon.</UTT>Simpson probably had more episodes than pokemon, but one without Bart and no mention of him.</UTT>Tons of Pokemon. I'm surprised he only appeared in one episode. I think that show has been running for 30 years now.</UTT>And they don't seem to mind the competition. When the Simpsons' South Park airs episodes related to Family Guy, the producers receive flowers from the crew.</UTT>They're pretty awesome at that. Do you like horror films?</UTT>I don't. I'd much rather watch "Bambi" than Stephen King, but that film is terrifying and the first horror movie he's seen calls it.</UTT>It's hilarious how he thinks it's scary. I guess it's possible when there's a fire in the forest.</UTT>I suppose he burns more than 180 calories. That's the amount you can lose watching a horror film.</UTT>That's a really good way to burn some extra calories. I guess it's because your heart beats faster when you're scared.</UTT>Say if you watched a horror movie before viewing art, you would appreciate abstract art more.</UTT>That's interesting, did it say why?</UTT>No explanation, but something in our brains probably processes different information than stimuli. You know that there is only a single fold in the brain that distinguishes between reality and fantasy.</UTT>That is very interesting. I've seen people play fantasy national spelling bees.</UTT>And I've learned that even fantasy congresses are and you receive points based on the success of legislation. I'm terrible at that game.</UTT>That's funny, I only play fantasy football and baseball. What about you?</UTT>I don't play in any fantasy leagues, I'm just more of a spectator than I am of film and television. I like Shining, but don't like horror. Kinda nice if the actors portraying Danny never knew they were acting in horror films.</UTT>The Shining is a very good movie. Nice to chat with you. Have a good weekend.</UTT>1

Hello there, do you want to talk about government?</UTT>Good Morning. I think I can talk about government and politics all day long.</UTT>Well, we know that government governs a system or group of people, which often governs organized communities (states). If government is defined broadly associatively, it normally consists of legislatures, executive and judicial bodies.</UTT>Yes, I find it funny that Wikileaks publishes a government plan to destroy Wikileaks.</UTT>Yes, I agree. Do you know that 86 percent of Nevada is owned by the US government? Wow!</UTT>Wow, that's a lot of land. I think it would be nice if the Norwegian government did in 2008.</UTT>They donated $1 Billion to help save Amazon Rainforest. That's their generosity.</UTT>Yes, I agree. It is very selfless. Have you heard of men in France selling Eiffel Towers?</UTT>He impersonated a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower once every two years. It was outraged, wasn't it?</UTT>Completely insane. I know the current Zimbabwean president gets a lot of flack, but the first Zimbabwean president is called Banana. I wonder if Zimbabwe is complimented?</UTT>If they are considered to be the main exporter, it might be a compliment. The Indonesian president also released 3 pop albums while in office. Cool.</UTT>Yeah, maybe. And that's a surprise to the album.</UTT>And the presidential election candidate automatically became a vice president until 1802, in the US. It's still not too like that.</UTT>I don't think having Trump and Clinton together is a good idea. They don't get long at all.</UTT>Or they can just do if they have to, I just think. Do you know anything about radio anyways? Interesting topic and a website where you can listen to thousands of classic radio drama episodes for free?</UTT>I like radio. I know Jupiter has a storm so strong that am radio can pick it up and hear it.</UTT>And funny thing is that Canadian laws say all radios must have at least 40% Canadian music on them.</UTT>I like that law, it seems to keep things fair.</UTT>Maybe a good thing. You know soldiers made simple radios during WWII using razor blades and pencils as diodes. I think Foxhole Radio is called.</UTT>No kidding, sounds creative.</UTT>I'd like to try and make one, I'd have a nice chat with you.</UTT>1

You play music instruments?</UTT>I'm not really saying that to you.</UTT>I really don't play music. I've heard a song used to test an auto piano. It's too hard for human beings to play.</UTT>They say Chopin can only play and is simply too difficult for anybody else.</UTT>I wonder if the piano on top of Britain's highest mountain is true. That sounds hard to believe. Who put it there and why?</UTT>Is there only one way to find out?</UTT>We can replace the piano with an aluminum piano like they used on the Handenburg.</UTT>Why aluminum?</UTT>I guess the lightest metal is cheap enough to build a piano. A piano on the top of a mountain in Britain weighs only 356 pounds.</UTT>I wonder if they transport that piano there in one piece for a whole, then in smaller pieces and then assemble it?</UTT>That's a good point. They can assemble it piece by piece, and you have to have piano experts climb there as well. A helicopter is possible. I wonder how high they can go.</UTT>I think the main question is why? Who the hell wants to play the piano after climbing a mountain? Put a bar there with warm wine.</UTT>The piano is an old instrument dating from the 1700s. I think there must be some quirky fans out there. They put the piano on the top of a mountain because it was there.</UTT>What do you mean by "it's there"?</UTT>Why do you climb Mt. Everest? Because it's there.</UTT>Do you like Linking Park?</UTT>Linkin Park. Are they a band?</UTT>quite famous They played 324 concerts in 2001 alone because their first album was so popular.</UTT>I can't imagine doing 324 a year. So they must be pretty young to maintain that pace.</UTT>They are young and successful.</UTT>I bet they won't tour that much later on. It's quite grueling. Fans love it, but it's hard for them to have a normal life on the road.</UTT>I guess so, but who said a famous musician had a normal life?</UTT>That's true, I've seen the Ramones do over 2000 concerts. 20 years on tour tough. They live in hotel rooms.</UTT>Wow, they probably don't know any other life. It was one huge party.</UTT>I'm not just surprised they are constantly stimulated.</UTT>LOL, I agree that all that booze and drugs after a concert probably doesn't help, or are they?</UTT>I don't think they remember the first tour of 19.5 years.</UTT>LOL You're probably right, hey, really nice to chat.</UTT>Great chat!</UTT>1

Do you like horses?</UTT>I like horses, do you know that horses are ticklish?</UTT>I don't know about that. Like super ticklish?</UTT>Yes with sharks and orangutans, what's that for weird animal facts?</UTT>It's pretty weird, you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses?</UTT>No kidding, and he did do a movie about being a horse I can remember. I wonder how he did it.</UTT>I'm not sure. Can he take Claritin?</UTT>Hahaha, maybe. Do you know that individual horses have a peak horsepower of 14.9.</UTT>I can see that. And you know that the island horses have a fifth speed?</UTT>They do. I wonder about all of that.</UTT>It's for speed walking and tolting.</UTT>Oh, that makes perfect sense.</UTT>You use reddit?</UTT>I have in the past. I know that the co-founder of Reddit is the cat named Karma. I think that is cute.</UTT>Interesting. Do you know that the first comment was a complaint?</UTT>Now are you serious? Why am I not surprised by that? I know the subject is the organization of posts in subreddits created by users.</UTT>That's pretty funny, only 0.3% of people actually participated in those visits.</UTT>I can see that. I know it ranks as the most visited website in the US.</UTT>Wow, I really don't know that, that's great, nice chat with you.</UTT>And it ranks 6th worldwide. I must get back. Have a good night, nice chat.</UTT>That's crazy, well take it easy.</UTT>1

Good morning, you</UTT>Goofing in the morning? Listening to jazz?</UTT>Sometimes yes, it makes me feel classy, especially when I cook dinner, don't you?</UTT>I do. Lint Eastwood apparently agrees with us.</UTT>Wow, I never guessed he liked music so much. I only thought it was his old western cowboy whistle.</UTT>I wonder if he ever attended a free jazz concert organized by a woman in Harlem?</UTT>He can. Have you ever noticed how many jazz musicians have goatees?</UTT>I do because they say it provides comfort when I play. I don't know if that is true. As a musician, I think playing facial hair is distracting.</UTT>Maybe. I keep thinking what happens if the hair gets their way.</UTT>I also don't remember some of the great goatee-haters (Dizzy Gillespie and Louie Armstrong) who didn't both have facial hair.</UTT>Hmm, maybe I'm bamboozled.</UTT>It might be. lol. How do you feel about rape?</UTT>I actually enjoy some of it. Nowadays there is no mumbling stuff, but I tend to enjoy something with a good melody and actual singing. What do you do?</UTT>I agree with you, I love old school rap, but I don't love some stuff today.</UTT>Some modern stuff is good too. I like Kid Cudi, Kyanye and even Lil Peep.</UTT>Tupac even had his own culturally significant music in the Library of Congress.</UTT>I'm surprised to hear that, but in his lifetime he had a huge impact on culture. Do you know that in the Rattrats, Busta Rhymes voiced the Tar wagon?</UTT>I don't. I don't see it, but I loved Rugrats as a kid.</UTT>The wagon didn't talk, as I remember.</UTT>Reptar is the best. Eminem wants a comic book artist.</UTT>I can see that, a lot of rappers have a really big art mind, and sometimes just music isn't enough.</UTT>1

Do you ever think that celebrities in science are rarer than in music, films, sports and politics?</UTT>I never thought that. Are you a Stephen Hawking fan?</UTT>I think it's amazing how completely paralyzed he is and how much he can accomplish.</UTT>I agree he is brilliant as well. He is the ultimate example of mind over matter.</UTT>He is one of the first to apply quantum physics to black holes and to predict with his hawk-radiation process.</UTT>It is incredible how he understands and explains quantum physics and other matter.</UTT>I really don't understand what he is saying because it seems so foreign to me, but he also has a lot of wit to share with the world.</UTT>Yeah, I'm the same, it's very complex stuff. Scientists have theorized that the universe evolved by natural selection, like species did here.</UTT>Hawking was very active up to the end of life. I must give credit to his supporters as well.</UTT>I agree with you there, I guess the radical theory is that there are only one electron in the universe, I'm sure Hawking disagrees.</UTT>Probably. Space regions also pull galaxies outside the observable universe. So there must be so much out there.</UTT>Wow, thinking about the whole universe in general is wild.</UTT>Strange, but there are some stars cold enough to be touched by humans' hands.</UTT>That's a very cool strange fact. Do you know Kim Jong-un has a degree in physics?</UTT>I'm not sure that's a person, but I wonder if Hawkings validated a tidbit about how the universe could come from nothing without violating physics.</UTT>I'm not sure that's an interesting thought, and he's the leader of North Korea.</UTT>Wow, first acting in the Aladdin film Robin Williams started the trend of celebrities voiced in animated films.</UTT>I don't know about that. I guess Pixas spent 3 years studying physics of curly hair to get the Mesa's hairs bravely right.</UTT>People don't realize how much time is spent on these details. Judy the judge made a heap of money out of the episode, with the highest paid celebrities of Lebron James.</UTT>That was so much holy cow episode. I wonder what other TV people make.</UTT>I don't know, but I guess not as much. Caroline Burnett on Sesame Street is the first celebrity.</UTT>1
Do you ever think that celebrities in science are rarer than in music, films, sports and politics?</UTT>I never thought that. Are you a Stephen Hawking fan?</UTT>I think it's amazing how completely paralyzed he is and how much he can accomplish.</UTT>I agree he is brilliant as well. He is the ultimate example of mind over matter.</UTT>He is one of the first to apply quantum physics to black holes and to predict with his hawk-radiation process.</UTT>It is incredible how he understands and explains quantum physics and other matter.</UTT>I really don't understand what he is saying because it seems so foreign to me, but he also has a lot of wit to share with the world.</UTT>I'm the same quantum, it's very explicable stuff. Scientists are blacking out the universe is real through natural selection, like species are here.</UTT>Hawking was a very hawk up to the end of his life. He must ultimately give credit to his supporters.</UTT>I agree with you there, I guess the radical theory is that there are only one electron in the universe, I'm sure Hawking disagrees.</UTT>Probably. Space regions also pull galaxies outside the observable universe. So there must be so much out there.</UTT>Wow, thinking about the whole universe in general is wild.</UTT>Strange, but there are some stars cold enough to be touched by humans' hands.</UTT>That's a very cool strange fact.

Hello, who are you today?</UTT>Hello, good, HIIT just works and lets the movie run in the background.. you?</UTT>Just decided to move the superheroes that NFC is watching. Should there be any?</UTT>Are you a fan of Marvel or DC?</UTT>Sure, Marvel. But I'm in favor of the Dark Knight trilogy.</UTT>Kindred spirit. I would suggest anything to help you get ready for Endgame, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, CPT America, Thor, Hulk, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Doctor Stan Lee, etc. genius.</UTT>It's really, I saw Captain Marvel this weekend, so I was pumping it into Endgame. I don't know if Disney owns the rights to all the big marvel characters.</UTT>They don't exactly own them, they don't own the right to show their big names characters in their theme parks east of the Mississippi. You know that Marvel and DC have one character together.</UTT>That makes sense, I don't know that. What character is that?</UTT>The characters are called Access and are solely trying to keep both companies' universes separate.</UTT>Hahaha I guess that makes sense. Do you watch a lot of TV?</UTT>Not really, but the darn thing is always in my house anyway. Kids, husband, background noise. Thank goodness there is an energy efficient TV set readily available. What about you?</UTT>I agree, I actually agree with Simpson mainly once in awhile.</UTT>Oh my god my husband loves Simpson, Family Guy, South Park, Bobs Burgers and Archer, I might go on and on lol I bet you know some interesting stuff about it if you like the show.</UTT>I did. Only one episode of Simmons where Bart was not mentioned or seen.</UTT>I wonder whoa one, I know a really amusing fact, you know when South Park airs the Family Guy finale, the producers receive flowers from the crew behind Simpsons. That's hilarious!</UTT>I remember that episode quite well. Have you ever watched pokemon?</UTT>I do, I watched a ton of it as a kid, it has well over 700 episodes, I wonder how many years will come out. I'm late 20 and it has to be over 15 years old.</UTT>50 episodes over 16 years. I remember watching it as a kid too. Great chat with you.</UTT>Have a good day too.</UTT>Thanks!</UTT>1

Have you ever watched Full House?</UTT>Hello, I loved Full House growing up. What about you?</UTT>I do too. People seem to be obsessed with the Olsen Twins ever since that show.</UTT>I agree. Do you know that Pixar has secret rooms used by celebrities?</UTT>That's pretty neat. I wonder if Judge Judy was ever there. Do you know she makes $123,000 an episode?</UTT>She made so much money she was crazy. Do you know Robin Williams voiced Genie in Aladdin?</UTT>I know that. He first started the trend of celebrities performing vocals in animated films.</UTT>That's pretty cool. Sad to have him go out the way he does. I've always liked him.</UTT>Yeah, it definitely breaks my heart. He seems such a good person and kind soul.</UTT>I agree. Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who claims he can combat hunger by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods.</UTT>I hope he can do that. Do you know the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street?</UTT>I didn't. What was it?</UTT>iii It's Caroline Burke.</UTT>Interesting, I never guess. Do you like nintendo?</UTT>I used to play with myi all the time. I actually bought one of the last systems when they discontinued it in Japan in 2003.</UTT>I love myi too. Myi's first system as a child.</UTT>It's funny that it can only display 54 colors, but it's so fun.</UTT>That's funny, how much technology has advanced since then is crazy.</UTT>It's crazy and I feel like the system can now display an end-to-end color.</UTT>Sure. Do you know Bill Nye got a break by winning the look alike contest with Steve Martin?</UTT>I see both of them in a younger picture, and I can see that totally now. I wonder if the rejection of a movie role because it had Ronald Reagan's look to it inspired him to run.</UTT>That's hilarious, well talk to you, have a good day.</UTT>1

You are a chance tennis fan. Nikola Djokovic is surely a great player.</UTT>I'm not actually, I don't even know who he is.</UTT>He is a Serbian tennis player. It's tough to play tennis in wet conditions, but they want to use helicopters to dry the grass after the rain.</UTT>I heard they did that, pretty genius if you asked mei.</UTT>Yeah, I agree. If you can believe it, the match will last 11 hours.</UTT>I believe it will be played for a few days.</UTT>That's amazing. In 1968, a black man won the first title in the U.S. Open, and since then, no black man has won it.</UTT>Some people get kicked out for grunting too much. Some circles consider themselves cheating on that.</UTT>I think some people who think they are cheating are a bit ridiculous. The polo shirt was originally invented for tennis. I don't know about that.</UTT>Have you ever played table tennis?</UTT>I really like that game. I don't want to play Gail Monfils.</UTT>I'm sure it doesn't either. I used to think of it as ping pong. Myii is so silly.</UTT>I don't think it's silly, I definitely caught that as well. It's a fun form of entertainment, but I also like playing nintendo. The original nintendo entertainment system can only display 54 colors.</UTT>I love nintendo, I think it's a better nintendo.</UTT>It might be. I love playing Donkey Kong. Around the 50's they bred chickens for entertainment. LOL</UTT>That's cool. I think we have better stuff to do these days.. you're right..</UTT>Yeah sure, I don't want to play chicken, I like to watch movies, I never knew Ronald Reagan was an actor, I can't believe he was rejected for a role because he didn't look like a president.</UTT>Yeah, I think he was in a few things before becoming president.</UTT>I'd like to see that movie. They should have them on netflix. In September 2003 the original nintendo entertainment system finally discontinued in Japan. It's a great run.</UTT>It has a great run. I know it bought a few over the years. You have a good one.</UTT>1

Do you have a TV show you like?</UTT>Hi, I do. I love Simsons among other shows. What suggestion do you make?</UTT>I'm a fan of the 1970's show and the days like this, but I don't understand why the cast cancelled it after only 10 episodes.</UTT>I'm not really sure why there is, it might be the UK humor is different. Have you ever watched SNL?</UTT>It's probably. I think Remade from the 70s did ok in the UK. The weekend update was my favorite because it was hilarious. Are you a fan?</UTT>Yeah, I too. I guess it's the most run-on skit they have on SNL.</UTT>I can see why. It's witty, entertaining and hilarious. I also forgot about the Trump impersonators, but Alec Baliand narrated Thomas the Tank for at least 52 episodes. What a drastic change.</UTT>It's the same guy as Alec, he's so good at it too, sure it's a huge change, have you ever watched Simpsons?</UTT>Oh, it's so he. I watch it occasionally and know it's wild popular and successful, but I've never noticed an episode where Bart wasn't present. Did you watch Simpsons?</UTT>I did, and I'm not sure that was an episode, at least not even mentioning him.</UTT>I also didn't realize that the game was on that long. At least 750 episodes. I thought that pokemon was something popular decades ago, but it didn't appear on the game.</UTT>I think they made a comeback to pokemon go and they've been on for 16 years. That's amazing.</UTT>Oh yeah, that was very popular when it first came out. I only heard it on the radio and it never played, did it?</UTT>I didn't play it either but I know it's all over. Back to your hockey hobby, enjoy it?</UTT>I never played hockey, although it's been a lot of snow. Is hockey quite as big as it is in Canada, where their national sport?</UTT>I think it's really popular up there. Did you hear the US olympic team lost to the English high school team?</UTT>High schoolers lost to Olympic teams, wow, they'd be kind of embarrassed if they didn't let them win. Hockey players were traded for only one dollar and went on to win four Stanley Cups.</UTT>I guess that trade didn't stop him from playing great after all. It seems amazing that the Slovakian women's team scored a goal every 44 seconds.</UTT>That's impressive, isn't hockey different from ice hockey as some countries refer to?</UTT>I think they are the same. I know field hockey isn't ice-related, but those two should be the same.</UTT>Oh, I think both sound really painful, ok, the average professional player even loses up to 8 pounds in one game.</UTT>1

Hi, enjoy reading?</UTT>I used to read a lot in high school, I heard good sci-fi novels called Starship Troops and the US military listed me as a reader.</UTT>That's pretty cool. A woman who holds a speed reading record.</UTT>Anne Jones can read 4700 times a minute. I wonder how long it takes to read the Bible.</UTT>I bet pretty fast. Do you know Tolkien and Cs Lewis?</UTT>I think he wrote "Game of Thrones" or "Lord of the Rings". I don't know if they like laughing at bad poetry all the time.</UTT>Aha, yeah, they have that contest that one laughs at first.</UTT>I don't sound too fun, and haven't read the "Ender's Game" suggested in the US Marine Corps.</UTT>Yeah, I'm not sure why they should have that. Do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Sometimes I really like to see if I can pick up Jupiter's radio waves, and wonder if they can be heard.</UTT>Yeah that's so cool. Have you ever listened to Canadian radio?</UTT>I don't think I've heard of any Canadian radio stations.</UTT>Well, they are legally playing 40% Canadian music.</UTT>I have never heard much Canadian music and I don't know if I enjoy listening to a lot of the music played on the radio.</UTT>Yeah, that's a lot of Justin Bieber, sure.</UTT>I don't know what's worse, just Biber or listening to Nintii Latina in Finland.</UTT>I don't speak Latin so I'm bored, but it's interesting that they give news there.</UTT>I wonder if there are any Latin rappers. I heard Korea has a battle rapper who compliments.</UTT>I really like listening to that do you like Eminem?</UTT>He has some good songs and I heard he is a huge Spiderman fan.</UTT>I heard that too, I had a nice chat with you.</UTT>1

Hey, how did it go and you don't like horror films?</UTT>I like them and am not easily scared, so I find them entertaining.</UTT>Have you ever seen Babi? I guess Stephen King considered that a horror movie.</UTT>I don't. It's weird to consider King one of the most renowned horror authors. I guess we all have fear.</UTT>Haha, he might be afraid of deer, i need to watch more horror movies, you burn almost 200 calories watching one.</UTT>Yeah, he could, that's a great thing, I could pick up a habit of watching horror films every day to lose weight and get fit.</UTT>Haha, you should come out with a book on weight loss, that's a secret. Also, after watching a horror movie, it appears that you appreciate art more.</UTT>That is indeed a strange fact. Have you ever seen a waterphone?</UTT>No, but I heard them. They made a creepy noise. Have you seen one?</UTT>I also haven't heard of them being used in horror films. I wonder how they look. Watch the classic horror film The Shining.</UTT>I saw that. Glad the kids there didn't know they were making horror movies at the time. They might be really scared.</UTT>That could create some serious scars, sure that was a sacary movie, do you use the internet a lot?</UTT>I use it all the time. My favorite button is the hamburger button, three horizontal lines, which makes me hungry.</UTT>Interesting name indeed makes me hingry as well. Good thing the internet has a backup copy in just case.</UTT>It's housed in the Library of Alexandria. I wonder how much space that takes up and how often they take snapshots.</UTT>I'm not sure, but I guess it requires a lot of power and storage space.</UTT>Oh, and also good to know that there is a 3 gigabit service at Mountain Everest so I can use Facebook at the summit.</UTT>It's good, i'd like to post the image if it makes it to the top, it's really sweet and unique.</UTT>You sure know you can be an internet addict hahahaha.</UTT>That's funny because the novelty clicks, I wonder how people overcommit to that addiction.</UTT>Haha, I just don't know, I also don't know that 7% of people read full term when they buy products online, and it seems to be actually high.</UTT>Yeah, I know I didn't read the terms in my contract, and I bet most of my friends didn't either. lol</UTT>1

Hey, people think that is something to be considered.</UTT>That's funny because the novelty clicks, I wonder how people overcommit to that addiction.</UTT>Haha, I just don't know, I also don't know that 7% of people read full term when they buy products online, and it seems to be actually high.</UTT>Yeah, I know I didn't read the terms in my contract, and I bet most of my friends didn't either. lol</UTT>0
Hello, enjoy your mountain biking, have you ever considered riding under a power line?</UTT>At times your power line is near. It is inevitable in modern life. I haven't stayed under them for a long time. Bike trails under them have no appeal.</UTT>It seems a bit crazy to me. They created a 6 mile trail following the power line in Maryland.</UTT>Now if people are annoyed at peeping into the windows of these Dagnija Kreslins I might just go to supper. You can buzz them under a 6 mile line in the rain some times.</UTT>Yeah, that's what it's about. Do you enjoy running? Runters use trails because the dirt paths are easier than on the knees. I love running.</UTT>Not a running person, it gets annoying to mix up single track use some time. Co-operation with utilities seems like a good idea Gretchen Bolton went the way of the nice shirt.</UTT>What is your favorite travel mode? The Netherlands currently creates 160-mile-per-hour commuter buses.</UTT>I'm not sure I want to go 160 mph on a yellow bus and a cranky Dutch man at the wheel. My favorite mode is motorcycle, no luggage, no plans, and going back to work a week later.</UTT>That sounds nice. I agree that 160 mph is too fast, but I prefer cars. There is no public rail system in the island and people fly between cities often. I am not a fan of flying.</UTT>I don't understand Japan. That's easy to say 300 dollars to travel across the country seems a lot. Flying may be safer.</UTT>That's too expensive. I also enjoy walking, it helps me get around and doesn't cost anything. Do you know that putting a dry tea bag in a smelly shoe can remove the odor?</UTT>I know that. Fresh used coffee ground works well too. If you walk along the ridge line it's easy to see. If you walk along the bottom about 3-4 feet. Much more stealth.</UTT>Interesting. That's good info, I'd prefer to wear tennis shoes because they're comfortable and I can take them on the Montgomery Trail.</UTT>You never have a pair of shoes that you can't stand in. There's just something wrong with them. It turns out that 5000 year old shoes perform better than some modern ones.</UTT>I have. I wonder what makes those old shoes better. A professional ballet dancer can go through 4 pairs of shoes a week. That's pricey.</UTT>I never wanted to wear ballet shoes, it looks painful, you know people do odd things for fashion, modern shoes can be too fashionable.</UTT>I agree with that. Fashion shoes are also too expensive. Some high fashion shoes can sell for thousands of dollars for a pair.</UTT>Sounds about right, $15 a pair. Stephen Marbury went the way of the worm.</UTT>Yep, the perfect amount to spend on shoes! I also think I could live in Hawaii with my aloha office business shirts.</UTT>Dressed shirt and dress shorts, black socks and dress shoes in Jamaica. I've seen the look of layering with popped collars before. Funny guy.</UTT>Wow, that looks quite. Well, talk to you. Enjoy the travels, no matter what choice you make to get there.</UTT>I hope you are better than travelling with Billy Mays. Pall bearer with blue shirt and khaki pants.</UTT>That looks odd.</UTT>1
Hello, enjoy your mountain biking, have you ever considered riding under a power line?</UTT>At times your power line is near. It is inevitable in modern life. I haven't stayed under them for a long time. Bike trails under them have no appeal.</UTT>It seems a bit crazy to me. They created a 6 mile trail following the power line in Maryland.</UTT>Now if people are annoyed at peeping into the windows of these Dagnija Kreslins I might just go to supper. You can buzz them under a 6 mile line in the rain some times.</UTT>Yeah, that's what it's about. Do you enjoy running? Runters use trails because the dirt paths are easier than on the knees. I love running.</UTT>Not a running person, it gets annoying to mix up single track use some time. Co-operation with utilities seems like a good idea Gretchen Bolton went the way of the nice shirt.</UTT>Currently the Netherlands has created 160-mile-per-hour commuter buses.</UTT>I'm not sure I want to go 160 mph on a yellow bus and a cranky Dutch man at the wheel. My favorite mode is motorcycle, no luggage, no plans, and going back to work a week later.</UTT>That sounds nice. I agree that 160 mph is too fast, but I prefer cars. There is no public rail system in the island and people fly between cities often. I am not a fan of flying.</UTT>I don't understand Japan. That's easy to say 300 dollars to travel across the country seems a lot. Flying may be safer.</UTT>That's too expensive. I also enjoy walking, it helps me get around and doesn't cost anything. Do you know that putting a dry tea bag in a smelly shoe can remove the odor?</UTT>I know that. Fresh used coffee ground works well too. If you walk along the ridge line it's easy to see.

I prefer Hawaii.</UTT>Dressed shirt and dress shorts, black socks and dress shoes in Jamaica. I've seen the look of layering with popped collars before. Funny guy.</UTT>Wow, that looks quite.

Hello, do you follow tennis?</UTT>Not really, I just know that each player uses a sling racket and hits a hollow ball.</UTT>Do you know that the Polo shirt was originally invented for tennis?</UTT>I know. I know that the Lacoste shirt has a crocodile and it was a symbol for the famous crocodile player, Rene the Crocodile.</UTT>Yep. Back in 1968, a black man won the first US Open tennis title, and since then, no black man has won it.</UTT>Wow, over 50 years and still holding records. I think next year in 1969 they will use helicopters to dry grass tennis courts for US Open.</UTT>I agree. They used helicopters to dry grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.</UTT>They do. The longest tennis match goes on for 11 hours over 3 days. I bet they are exhausted.</UTT>That's crazy long.</UTT>I agree. The fact you can find it on google is amazing. You know that a single search on google requires more compute power than it takes to send Neil Armstrong to the moon.</UTT>That's pretty amazing. I've seen Google Maps calculate traffic by how fast Android devices move on the road.</UTT>I never knew that. I wonder what. I know I heard back the days that Google used goats to control the lawn instead of hiring people to mow.</UTT>That's hilarious. Back in 2013, Google went down for 5 minutes and took 40% of web traffic.</UTT>I can imagine. I use it a lot. Hard to believe it has only been around since 1998.</UTT>I agree. During border disputes, Google maps tailors maps to each country's claim for the Internet browser.</UTT>That sounds logic. I wish I had gotten on board with the initial public offer to buy the stock in 2004. I can't even imagine the outcome.</UTT>I can't either. Do you like shoes?</UTT>I love shoes. I know that the shoes made 5000 years ago perform better than today.</UTT>Pretty amazing how well they perform than the shoes of today.</UTT>I agree, but I can't see what happened. I find the array of choices amazing, like a pair of thousands of dollars.</UTT>Good to chat with you.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you?</UTT>I love watching some good comedy on TV. You do.</UTT>I do. What comedy are you in favor of?</UTT>Friends and Seinfeld are some of my favorites on NBC.</UTT>That one is good. I felt Seinfeld held up well, but my friends didn't hold up so much. Did you watch the office?</UTT>I never watched the office, but I like Parks and Recreation.</UTT>I love that show too, it's written so well, it's so funny, I could lose a whole day watching that show.</UTT>Yes, it seems that NBC has a lot more dramas now than comedies like Chicago.</UTT>I don't think they can compete with NFC's comedies or movies, so they have to go with drama.</UTT>They had Will and Grace Thursday, not much else.</UTT>Reboots are as good as the originals. I really like the originals, but I didn't see the reboot.</UTT>I haven't seen the reboot either but it was adopted for a new season. NBC has a bunch of failed comedy shows compared to other networks.</UTT>They just picked up Brooklyn 99, so the new comedy they got..the other one?</UTT>They have a new bar comedy called "Abbys" in the backyard also.</UTT>Is it really? Will you see it or will it just be piloted at this point?</UTT>I didn't see it, but it picked up midseason.</UTT>I must check it out. I haven't heard of it. Did you watch a voice-like show?</UTT>I sometimes watch vv shows, they can definitely be interesting. The Olympics definitely helped NBC get some good ratings as well.</UTT>I only see the voice once like one. My wife watched it to get some of it, but I didn't watch that type of show. I love the Olympics though.</UTT>Yes, I prefer comedy. I love bromantic comedy like Harold and Kumar and hangovers.</UTT>Wow, first hangover was brilliant, next two.</UTT>Yes, Bill Murray, I agree that the kung fu hustle is amazing, a comedy.</UTT>I was shocked to learn that Jim Carter no longer did drama. He is a talent, but I felt a little off.</UTT>He wants to do a positive movie.</UTT>1

Hello, who are you today?</UTT>I'm good, do you like watching comedy?</UTT>I love comedy, do you like it?</UTT>I'm a big fan, probably a movie of my favorite type above the other genres. Since it was created in 1989, Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows. That's a lot.</UTT>That's a ton. I see Bill Murray thinking that Kung-Fu Hustle is the supreme comedy achievement of the modern age.</UTT>Hmmmm then it must be funny I've never seen it, you?</UTT>I haven't seen it yet either. I saw the original Green Lantern film as a comedy.</UTT>I don't know about that. Jack Black also stars in it. Remember the 3rd Rock from The Sun?</UTT>I remember the 3rd Rock from the Sun, I didn't get to watch it too much.</UTT>It was a funny show. It was corny but still laughable. In 1997 it won the golden globe for the best comedy series. Sure time flew by. That felt like yesterday.</UTT>That's interesting, and time definitely flew by.</UTT>Have you ever seen Incredibles 2?</UTT>I haven't yet. What about you?</UTT>I do. Can't believe it's been 15 years already since the first one came out in 2004.</UTT>That's pretty crazy. I saw the movie actually set in the 60's.</UTT>I don't know about that. So interesting that director Brad Bird voices a girl who designed the superhero costume in the Edna movie.</UTT>It's a very cool voice, Brad Bird.</UTT>I agree, the girl who voiced the character of the Volet is Sarah Vowell, she's also a political commentator, and the author of the most sold historical fiction. That's pretty neat.</UTT>That's really neat, I'll have to try to catch that movie soon. Sounds pretty good.</UTT>It's fun to watch it, especially if you like comedies. I think anything that Pixar does is pretty good.</UTT>Great to talk to you.</UTT>1

Do you know much about the President?</UTT>I know some stuff. Do you know the 3 richest people in the US?</UTT>That was JFK, Washington, Jefferson.</UTT>Yes, do you know what to call the first Zimbabwean president?</UTT>He was called Banana the President.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder if that means something else in their language too?</UTT>I wonder too, do you know that white houses are smaller than guest houses?</UTT>I guess they get a lot of people there and need room.</UTT>Yeah, I guess. Do you know how the vice president used to be elected?</UTT>That's the running person moving into that position.</UTT>Yeah, do you know that Indonesia's President is a pop star?</UTT>And he has released three albums so far.</UTT>What a guy. Do you like nintendo?</UTT>I loved it too bad it discontinued too badly in 2003.</UTT>It only has 54 colors, but it's a lot of fun.</UTT>Yeah, I agree. Do you know Bill Nye?</UTT>Science guy. Do you know how he gets entertained?</UTT>He won the lookalike contest for Steve Martin.</UTT>Yeah, even Reagan once tried to act, but it didn't go very well.</UTT>They said he had no president looking at the film.</UTT>I guess he has a look of being a real president so I assume that's okay with him. Nice chat.</UTT>1

Do you believe in climate change?</UTT>I believe that the climate is changing but I'm not sure that man made it. Michael Mann from Penn State said that summer 2018 will have extreme weather.</UTT>I believe that man made it.</UTT>Why do you think that? There are so many different key diagnostic tools, but even x-rays of the earth show that the climate is changing, not why.</UTT>Sea level will increase and ice will keep melting at the two poles of the Earth.</UTT>Well, ice melts in the ice age, and there is no car, no smog, or even an industrial age.</UTT>But we don't exactly see why the melt occurred. Other Earth disasters we don't know about may occur.</UTT>That is very true. Scientists are really trying to develop more tools that are sort of like MRI waves but on Earth. I think this debate about why it happened would help.</UTT>I think so. Do you know that more than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests are already destroyed?</UTT>I don't know about that. That's so sad. Climate change, those wildfires, or such?</UTT>Human activity. It's so sad.</UTT>Wow, I have no idea. I know they blame all the heat, drought, wildfires, floods and hurricane stores for climate change.</UTT>Also do you know that the first time the Earth formed, it was only 5.5 hours a day?</UTT>I've never heard that before. Why is it 24 hours now? The sun/night isn't possible? I know the earth is almost twice as dense as the sun.</UTT>I'm not so sure, the Earth's rotation relative to the sun and moon could change.</UTT>That's interesting, do you know that you can fit all the planets between the Earth and the moon and still have room left over?</UTT>That was never heard of. It was such a vast space.</UTT>And the majority of the Earth's polar regions are still covered by ice. Wonder how climate change will affect Antarctic and Arctic in the near future?</UTT>The areas of this region have drastically disappeared.</UTT>That's sad, you really think so. I wish we could ensure that's not the case.</UTT>Yeah, people do that. You also know that the Earth will be helium free at the end of the 21st century?</UTT>Also, why is that because of climate change? How does everything adapt to that?</UTT>I have no idea where helium goes. I wonder where it goes.</UTT>This is so interesting, I hope we can still try to enjoy our Christmas even with all this doom and gloom. Thanks for talking to me.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>Have a Merry Christmas, give me a great start to the conversation.</UTT>1

Hi, can you play the piano?</UTT>I can play some and have an electric piano that I keep plugging in in my room.</UTT>That's really cool. I can play a bit, but I'll spend more time on other instruments. You know Freddie Mercury used the same piano in a recording studio as McCartney used on Hey Jude.</UTT>That's really cool. I wish the news played the piano instead of the news these days like it did back in 1930.</UTT>I know, it's far better than the slanted views they've all put out today. I actually enjoy that.</UTT>Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon's prime video and I use it really on TV these days.</UTT>I love Amazon. I love how they are so quick to get things out even on Sunday.</UTT>I could get a job at one of the Amazon warehouses. Sounds like a good idea for them to lose some extra weight as they walk 7-15 miles a day.</UTT>That could be a good gig for me too, as I'm trying to up my game of step.</UTT>I would love to visit the clock built by Jeff Bezos on the mountain.</UTT>That's cool, it's been running for 10,000 years so you have time.</UTT>Why do you feel like snakes? I have a king sized pet snake and I love it.</UTT>I don't think I could own one. I'm not scared or anything. You know there are no snakes in New Zealand.</UTT>That's pretty crazy. Owning a snake is only bad for upkeep because it can get expensive.</UTT>I bet your snake is one of the flying snakes?</UTT>Haha, the King Snake can't do that, I'm not sure I'd want to own that if I could, and it sounds very dangerous.</UTT>Where I live, giant cobras escape and loose in cities.</UTT>I hope someone caught it before someone killed it. You can't punish them for doing what they're hard wired to do.</UTT>They never found it. Die or live. I have a friend who is seriously afraid of snakes and runs away from the smallest of snakes.</UTT>I don't fear snakes, but I can almost not stand spiders even near me, and I hate little buggers.</UTT>I didn't bother with the small ones, but when they get past certain sizes nope, big from me. I freaked out by the roaches.</UTT>Hahaha yeah, the roaches are just downright nasty and would be good to chat to you in any way.</UTT>Have a good day here.</UTT>1

I used to dance back in the day. I love it. Do you know that babies spontaneously dance when they hear music?</UTT>It reacts naturally, all cultures have a dance.</UTT>I heard Bruce Lee was a great dancer. He seriously won the Hong Kong cha-cha challenge. Think of a great dancer.</UTT>Dance and formal martial arts share a lot, so I'm not surprised Bruce Lee is good at dancing.</UTT>Pupac is dancing ballet, I can't even imagine.</UTT>Ask a good dancer I think you are. Michael Jackson is even a patentee of a device to help him move the dance.</UTT>They say a ballet-favorite dance can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. I think they have to work in with them. MJ, love me some.</UTT>Ballet uses choreography in one way that dance can be characterised.</UTT>Do you watch the Super Bowl or have any fantasy drafts? Do you know that people draft national spelling bees in fantasy?</UTT>There is a fantasy Congress too. There seems to be a fantasy league for everything.</UTT>Yep, I'm crazy, I want to be part of Fantasy Congress.</UTT>Turns out a single fold in your brain separates your perception of fantasy from reality.</UTT>Can't believe that. Do you dislike science and the solar system?</UTT>Very much. Most people don't know the sun is white and is perceived as yellow in the atmosphere.</UTT>And it is only one billion times bigger than the biggest star. I am amazed by space.</UTT>If we can harness all the energy of the sun we will have enough to meet the needs of the earth in 500,000 years in a second.</UTT>Yep, my friend's mom was hit by lightning and died of energy. You know the bolts are 5 times hotter than the sun's surface.</UTT>I have no doubt that the lightning was very hot. It set many things on fire when it hit.</UTT>It's really powerful. I hate lightening but the sun provides so much. It provides one second of energy that will meet the needs of the entire planet for 500000 years.</UTT>The sun accounts for well over 99 percent of its system's mass and burns full tilt, so it's not surprising that it creates that much energy.</UTT>Good talk to you.</UTT>Time to see the sun that has left today.</UTT>1
I used to dance back in the day. I love it. Do you know that babies spontaneously dance when they hear music?</UTT>You react naturally. Fantasy culture needs dancing.</UTT>I heard Bruce Lee was a great dancer. He seriously won the Hong Kong cha-cha challenge. Think of a great dancer.</UTT>Dance and formal martial arts share a lot, so I'm not surprised Bruce Lee is good at dancing.</UTT>Pupac is dancing ballet, I can't even imagine.</UTT>Ask a good dancer I think you are. Michael Jackson is even a patentee of a device to help him move the dance.</UTT>They say a ballet-favorite dance can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. I think they have to work in with them. MJ, love me some.</UTT>Ballet uses choreography in one way that dance can be characterised.</UTT>Do you watch the Super Bowl or have any fantasy drafts? Do you know that people draft national spelling bees in fantasy?</UTT>There is a fantasy Congress too. There seems to be a fantasy league for everything.</UTT>Yep, I'm crazy, I want to be part of Fantasy Congress.</UTT>Turns out a single fold in your brain separates your perception of fantasy from reality.</UTT>Can't believe that. Do you dislike science and the solar system?</UTT>Very much. Most people don't know the sun is white and is perceived as yellow in the atmosphere.</UTT>And it is only one billion times bigger than the biggest star.</UTT>If we can harness the formal energy of the sun, you have what I have for a half a million years of the earth's needs after 1% for a second.</UTT>Yep, my friend's mom was hit by lightning and died of energy. You know the bolts are 5 times hotter than the sun's surface.</UTT>I have no doubt that the lightning was very hot.</UTT>It's really powerful. I hate lightening but the sun provides so much.

You watched Sesame Street?</UTT>I used to be when my kids were young. I like Oscar the Grouch. He seems realistic.</UTT>He is one of my favorite characters as well. He is green though, why? I always wonder that.</UTT>I don't know, he was orange once though, I didn't realize Jim Henson created Sesame Street, I know he did muppets.</UTT>Have you ever followed Carol Spinney?</UTT>I've never heard of him until now. I guess he created Oscar with the heart so that it can't be all bad.</UTT>Carl Spiney is the Big Bird, and Oscar the Grouch is also. I think it's kind of sad that he announced his retirement. I grew up watching the show.</UTT>That's sad. Oscar was called Kirpik and lives in a basket in Turkey.</UTT>LOL that's odd. Do you watch a lot of TV?</UTT>I guess it's about average. I like Simpsons. Only one of its many episodes has Bart or not been mentioned.</UTT>I didn't catch that episode, but Bart is my favorite character.</UTT>Homer my Homer, you know that Dodo is in the Pigeon family Imagine the mess around the park bench.</UTT>Dodo is now extinct and it's messy, I agree.</UTT>Yes, some birds' bones weigh less than their feathers.</UTT>Wow, they do, I guess because they can fly, some birds fly really long distances without sleeping.</UTT>The birds in Australia can mimic the sounds of chainsaws and car alarms.</UTT>I think they have serious identity issues. It's fun to listen to that. lol.</UTT>Do you know it is legal in South Africa to have your car thrown in flames?</UTT>I don't know about that. Why would they allow things like that? Thank God they are illegal in America.</UTT>Prevent carjacking. I prefer McDonalds where they invented drive thrus to help soldiers.</UTT>That seems excessive, McDonalds has a great idea and I bet it will lift sales and now every fast food chain has one.</UTT>Yep, thanks for the chat.</UTT>1

Do you like Taylor Swift?</UTT>Quite, you know she owns a private jet?</UTT>It costs about $40 million and is located at the Nashville airport.</UTT>Yes, it has its own private hanger in it.</UTT>Yeah, you know she accidentally released her white noise song for 8 seconds?</UTT>And that makes it to the top charts in Canada.</UTT>That's crazy. She also removed her music from Spotify.</UTT>Because she thinks music shouldn't be free.</UTT>Yeah, I guess. She sometimes walks backwards so they can't take pictures of her.</UTT>Wow, do you know much about the earth?</UTT>I know that we are sad to destroy 80 percent of the forest.</UTT>Yeah, you know how days used to be only 5.5 hours?</UTT>Yeah, do you believe in extraterrestrials?</UTT>I did, and now if the ambassador just showed up, the UN will assign him.</UTT>Yeah, the Earth is predicted to be helium-free by the end of the century.</UTT>Yeah, I guess there are no more fun balloons and funny voices for us.</UTT>I guess not. Do you know that in 24 hours we only represent the history of the earth for a minute?</UTT>Wow, and so much has been done to this planet so far.</UTT>I know, you use the internet a lot?</UTT>I actually did, but not as much as I developed an addiction to it.</UTT>That's always good, nice chat.</UTT>1

Have you heard of Mark E Smith's death at the age of 60 from The Fall?</UTT>That's too bad, I used to love his music, he sure was a visionary leader.</UTT>He's a punk rocker. Like musicians like others?</UTT>I like Eddie Van Halen and think he has some sweet solos like one of the songs "Beat It" and what about you?</UTT>I don't know my rock category very well. I like Queen and Aerosmith. The Fall had over 60 different members when it existed 40 years ago.</UTT>Like "Repetition"? It's also one of Fallen's favorite songs and Fallen's earliest?</UTT>Yes, I can know that is the only one. The band is considered the pinnacle of underground rock. That is like being on top of an anthill.</UTT>As for the group, I like that they have this classical touch, kind of like Beatles.</UTT>That's true for a select group of fans. A lot of albums are available today.</UTT>Do you know how many albums the group has?</UTT>I believe it was 65 years old. Many Facebook posts followed his death and many different songs were cited as favorites.</UTT>There are a lot of albums, I can search for a couple on Spotify, do you have a facebook account?</UTT>I have more friends than ii, but my wife has. I know a lot of people use blue on facebook because zappberg is red and green.</UTT>Oh, I think blue is why it looks cool or because it attracts people, but that's a cool fact.</UTT>Yes, sometimes things happen in our lives that are strange. NFC started because the guy was mad at the $40 late fee at Blockbuster. Burner King has a promotion to get one a free whopper by unfriending 10 people on facebook.</UTT>I remember that promotion, I actually took advantage of it, received a free whooper, I got you, and Ireland took it really to another level, though.</UTT>What does Island do?</UTT>Apparently, so Island basically re-wrote its constitution using Facebook feedback.</UTT>That's unique, you mentioned Van Halen before. Do you know that when he recorded his guitar solo for Beat It he set his studio speaker on fire?</UTT>I don't know if I've always liked that solo, but I don't know what's going on with his guitar. That's crazy.</UTT>But no guitar, speakers, I'm sure volume power creates heat, I'm going now, I'm enjoying talking to you.</UTT>1

How many times do you use your phone?</UTT>I have an iphone that I use all the time. Do you know women are more likely to have an iphone than men?</UTT>I don't. Do you have any ideas why?</UTT>I don't. I honestly don't even guess. I know the front man at the Museum uses the iphone for his child's heartbeat and then used it for a song. That's pretty interesting.</UTT>Wow, he must have had a very unique way of viewing the world as an artist. Did you know that when Microsoft launched their phone line, they held funerals for iPhone's deaths?</UTT>Wow, that's presumptuous. Both companies can do strange things. Job had to switch phones secretly during the presentation because he had run out of ram and crashed.</UTT>Another funny fact is the "Send to Heaven" iphone game that the creators developed to encourage people to shatter their phones as much as possible by seeing how high they tossed them in the air. Apple banned it because it encouraged behavior that damaged devices of users.</UTT>Wow, I can't imagine why people would use an app. Some common sense should be used. There are plenty of other apps to choose from. As of January 2017, there were 225,000 apps in the app store.</UTT>Not to mention that the iPhone is like a small laptop and a camera in one device that can fit your hand to take photos, play music, send and receive emails and browse the web.</UTT>They are pretty amazing, do you like horror films? I love them.</UTT>I love horror.</UTT>Yay, the boy who played Danny on "The Shining" doesn't know they film horror movies, that's probably good because the movie is intense.</UTT>I guess that allowed him to show genuine reactions perfectly captured in the film. I think it was very interesting, as it had a very interesting visual and could help burn 180+ calories.</UTT>I heard it burns calories. How fascinating. Enjoy Stephen King?</UTT>I personally don't watch much of him. However, I have seen many pop culture references to him, such as Gravity Falls. I also read the first horror film that he saw, "Bambi".</UTT>That is correct. It terrified him as a child and as a result we had many great works.</UTT>I mean, horror is generally inspired by many brilliant minds like Edgar Allen Poe or Mary Shelley. Would you rather have horror in a realistic slice of life setting than a more supernatural fantasy setting?</UTT>I really enjoyed both, but I would probably lean a little more towards the realistic. I really enjoyed Powell's Frankenstein. If you watched a horror movie before looking at abstract art, you know that it would be more appreciated.</UTT>I wonder why. Do you know that monsters aren't names, but mad scientist's are actually names?</UTT>I indeed did. Such a good book. Have you ever heard of a waterphone?</UTT>I recently read about them as instruments that make that creepy sound signature in horror flicks. I mean, what an amazing instrument that I never knew existed so prevalent in daily life.</UTT>That is correct.</UTT>1

Hi, did you listen to the music?</UTT>I love all types of music. One of my favorite things to do is listen to the radio in my car and sing along. Would you suggest?</UTT>Nice to me too. Have you ever managed to catch the storm of Jupiter?</UTT>Crazy that sound can be heard from that far. I wonder if it can do more than people think, change our mood and thoughts. I wonder how the Jupiter storm will affect us.</UTT>Hmm, good point. Do you listen to Canadian radio?</UTT>No, but I hear 40% of Canadian music must be Canadian, I love the rap they play on the radio, have you ever heard of Tupac?</UTT>His music is in the Congress Library and the guy is so important.</UTT>Rap music has come a long way since just poetry. Even in Korea where they make new kinds of rap called freestyle battles, are you still buying a CD or album?</UTT>I buy digital versions from time to time. Do you have a favorite?</UTT>I'm a big fan of rock music like Linkin Park. I think their Hybrid Theory is the most sold disc of the 21st century. Have you ever used a cassette?</UTT>I actually have that album and I love it and it's so great.</UTT>Amazing how people love music. I heard two 100 year old twins making rap CDs in Japan. Do you like rap more than rock?</UTT>Hmmm, I still don't like rock better, did you hear about reel big fish?</UTT>I've heard their great hit albums and think they're good. I like the old school rap more than today. Have you ever heard of NWA?</UTT>They have their first album that reached platinum without advertising it.</UTT>I think it's because they're unique and actually have some rape skills. Ever heard of Eminem. I think he's the best rapper.</UTT>I like him too. Do you know he wanted an original comic book artist?</UTT>I heard he was a big fan of Spider Man, kinda weird that his music is so unfriendly. I remember some radio stations didn't want to play his music.</UTT>Go figure. Do you know the song "Busta Rhymes"?</UTT>That's a rapper who knows how to rape really fast. I've heard him even on kids shows in voice. I think we should promote happy and positive rap music.</UTT>I totally agree with that, I believe that way can also educate. I'll chat to you nicely.</UTT>1

Hello, do you like horror films?</UTT>Not all, but I do watch occasional thrillers. You?</UTT>I like some. Do you know that Stephen King was terrified of the Bubby movie?</UTT>I heard that. Nolan's first horror film is considered. I'm not sure how he meant the horror film "Inception" did you see it?</UTT>Mental horror films are possible. I can definitely see how losing your mind or dream can scare you. That's an amazing movie by the way.</UTT>Amazing movie yes. Have you ever seen Phineas and Ferb?</UTT>I have no. What is that?</UTT>Well, the writer of the picture of the old Rocky Horror Show appears to be voiced by his dad.</UTT>That's cool. I heard you can burn up to 180 calories watching a horror movie.</UTT>There is no good reason to watch it, but you know the first international game was held in 1896.</UTT>Oh, I'm just not convinced you're watching a horror movie, I just recently read some interesting facts I think I share. I don't know that about the Olympics, lol, you don't even know that Shining kids know they shot a horror film.</UTT>I heard he didn't find out until years later. Wow, the most successful German competitor back then was Carl Schuhmann. He won 4 golds.</UTT>Oh, what?</UTT>Gymnastics and wrestling, I think he also competed in weightlifting, long jumps and shot put.</UTT>That's interesting, do you like gymnastics and wrestling?</UTT>I can both like a little more gymnastics. It is apparently Greek ancients practiced war. It is possible to imagine that war would have been averted by a wrestling match.</UTT>I think they are practicing to prepare for wars. What do you mean by wrestling matches? I recently read that an American with a wood leg won 6 gymnastics medals.</UTT>Wow, that's amazing. I just tried to be funny about wrestling matches to end the war, you know, horse mounting and dismounting is part of gymnastics.</UTT>LOL, ok, I guess I just didn't get it. That seems hard, have you ever tried?</UTT>I wrestle or mount horses, I do a little both.</UTT>Gymnastics is mounted, gymnastics is mounted. Talking to you is great. Have a good one.</UTT>1

Oddly, every one of us Republicans with a beard is a Republican.</UTT>That's odd, what do you think about Trump?</UTT>I like Trump.</UTT>I too. I think he needs a little bit of calm down sometimes, but he's a smart dude.</UTT>I never liked Trump before he was president. I think he did a great job of all the deals he had.</UTT>Trump is a Republican. You know, the president hasn't been a Republican or a Democrat since 1883.</UTT>You think the last time a Republican president was elected was in 1928 on a ticket like Nixon or Bush. How can that be?</UTT>It doesn't sound right to me either.</UTT>Funny how Harry Truman didn't want to be photographed on a dumbo ride because he didn't want to be associated with Republicans.</UTT>huh, they even took shots at them.</UTT>Yeah it looks like some things never change.</UTT>Only in 2000 did the party start consistently using red and blue.</UTT>Yeah, look at the blue red map, most of it is on the coast and the red in the middle.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder why that happened.</UTT>Bigger cities seem bluer.</UTT>I guess that makes a little bit of sense.</UTT>Nevada is 86 percent of the state owned by the government?</UTT>I believe it. Nevada is mostly desert, so who else wants it?</UTT>True, who wants it, guess it's good for nuclear tests.</UTT>Well, if they do that out there, I guess Wikileaks will let us know.</UTT>Yeah, Wikileaks can let us know about the space aliens in the 51 area too.</UTT>They published a government plan to destroy Wikileaks, so I'm sure they don't have a problem with them leeking it! lol</UTT>I've heard of Assange being offered an Australian passport and I've always thought he was European.</UTT>I did too, well chatted well, I had to get off here.</UTT>1

How can that be?</UTT>It doesn't sound right to me either.</UTT>Funny how Harry Truman didn't want to be photographed on a dumbo ride because he didn't want to be associated with Republicans.</UTT>huh, they even took shots at them.</UTT>Yeah it looks like some things never change.</UTT>Only in 2000 did the party start consistently using red and blue.</UTT>Yeah, the red and blue maps are done for most dumbos in the city and the middle.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder why that happened.</UTT>Bigger cities seem bluer.</UTT>I guess that makes a little bit of sense.</UTT>Nevada is 86 percent of the state owned by the government?</UTT>I believe it. Nevada is mostly desert, so who else wants it?</UTT>True, who wants it, guess it's good for nuclear tests.</UTT>Well, if they do that out there, I guess Wikileaks will let us know.</UTT>Yeah, Wikileaks can let us know that we are space aliens in Area 51 too. Oddly, every Republican we have a beard owed is a republican.</UTT>They published a government plan to destroy Wikileaks, so I'm sure they don't have a problem with them leeking it! lol</UTT>The president has always heard of the Australians offering to Assange and has shot him as being European. He doesn't like Trump.</UTT>I did too, well chatted well, I had to get off here.</UTT>0
I love pop music, it makes me want to dance. What should you do?</UTT>Hello, I like pop music, not all.</UTT>I'm a big fan of all music. I love driving my car and blasting music on my radio. Have you ever heard of the Cadillac car brand?</UTT>I'm having fun with that, I say. And yeah, why?</UTT>Is it my favorite car? Do you know the brand is named for the French explorer who founded Detroit? Have you ever seen a model T?</UTT>That's really cool, I don't know that, yeah, I have?</UTT>It was made by Ford in 1908 and I think the Benz motorwagen was invented in 1886. Do you own a lot of cars?</UTT>You were right about the Benz by Karl Benz back then. I only own two products. What do you suggest?</UTT>I own 3 of my favorites. I love going to the theater with my family. My kids love musicals. Have you seen any good ones?</UTT>It used to be fun when I was younger to go to that. I never went to an actual family musical.</UTT>I remember one time we were driving and we heard weird noises coming from the radio, my sister said you could hear Jupiter from your radio. I wonder if that is true?</UTT>I read that before. You are supposed to have heard large storms from Jupiter on am radio.</UTT>Crazy how you can pick up a sound wave and how simple it can be to do it. During WWII soldiers made radios with razorblades and pencils.</UTT>That's true, it's so amazing they can do that, I'm sure any little bit of entertainment will help.</UTT>Music is very easy to entertain people. The whole world loves music. You know the Indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>I've read that before. I wonder how bad or how good they are. I bet they sell really well though.</UTT>Music always does well Girls bands are really popular in North Korea I think pop music is accepted in most places do you like it girls bands?</UTT>I like some girl bands but most of them are really old music. Suggestions from you.</UTT>I like rock music more, but I like the fact that the United States created pop in the 1950s.</UTT>That's a cool fact, I liked a lot of US music in the 50's.</UTT>I've never heard that old music, but I like the '80s Ricky Gervais pop music.</UTT>That's sure interesting stuff, well, nice to talk to you, hope you have a good night.</UTT>You also have a good night and cherish your pop music and car radio.</UTT>Thanks, too.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you?</UTT>I'm great, do you like fiction?</UTT>I do most of the time. What about you?</UTT>I like it, and George R Martin is one of my favorite writers.</UTT>Funny how he despises fan fiction and says that it infringes on copyright and is a bad exercise in acting for aspiring actors.</UTT>I have to disagree with him there, a lot of fan fiction is actually pretty good.</UTT>I agree with you. The 1950s messed up when judges tried to ban science fiction comics because they featured black characters.</UTT>That's racist, I hope those judges get sanctioned.</UTT>I also hope that happens. Do you like drama?</UTT>I like them, House is one of my favorites, have you seen it before?</UTT>I thought I'd watched like one episode before.</UTT>Well remember the limping lead actor, Hugh Laurie, I see?</UTT>I'll do vaguely. He's the highest paid actor in TV dramas ever?</UTT>He makes about 700,000 per episode, and maybe a bit more now.</UTT>Nice, must be. Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?</UTT>Has he had a call since he was a little kid? I really have no idea.</UTT>All the prettiest girls in his high school were in drama classes.</UTT>Well, I see the decision clearly leading to a successful career path.</UTT>True, I love that Jim Carey doesn't make drama anymore because of his belief system.</UTT>I respect that because Jim Carey is a great actor and the positivity shared by others is a great emotion he has experienced.</UTT>I also respect that. I agree with him that the movie should project more positivity.</UTT>We should all be like Jim Carey more. We have a positive mindset and won't let negativity affect us either way. Hope you have a great night. Great chat during it.</UTT>Thanks, I'll chat with you as well, nice.</UTT>1

Do you like music?</UTT>I love it. Do you have a favorite singer?</UTT>I love the band Linkin Park and you?</UTT>Actually, I too, and they have the best selling album of the century.</UTT>Yeah, they did indeed have a huge success with the hybrid theory.</UTT>Yeah, have you heard of "Reel Big Fish"?</UTT>I have, they have to re-record their hits because they have a lot of rights.</UTT>What a dedication. The 100 year old twins in Japan released the album in 1992.</UTT>Wow, Impressive. Do you like dancing?</UTT>I love it. Bruce Lee used to dance cha-cha too.</UTT>Nice and Tupac too, but ballet.</UTT>Nice one, he's staring at the nutcracker production too.</UTT>Guys are just everywhere, no matter the music or the dance.</UTT>True, as soon as baby hears music, it is also good for baby to dance.</UTT>And they smile more when they hit the beat.</UTT>Yeah, pretty smart and music synchronized.</UTT>That's true, do you use the Internet much?</UTT>I actually use it a lot. Do you know the hamburger button?</UTT>That's a horizontal line menu.</UTT>Yeah, you know you can develop an addiction by clicking too much?</UTT>I can see that, and anything too much can lead to that.</UTT>1

Hi, are you a member of Amazon Prime?</UTT>Hello, yes, I am. Are you?</UTT>Absolutely, I've been doing business with Amazon for as long as they've been around since 1994.</UTT>Very good. Bezos built the clock on a mountain that could run for 10,000 years.</UTT>Nice. They used USPS on Sunday and could use all the help they could get?</UTT>I love the Sunday shipping. I wonder if those workers get overtime for that?</UTT>Who knows, all those warehouse workers walk 15 miles a day, which worries me.</UTT>That's a lot of walking. I've also seen Amazon own IMDB.</UTT>Yeah, I don't know if IMDB started streaming movies on Freedive since 1998.</UTT>Interesting. Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Of course, I must be from Jupiter to not listen to radio, and then the electromagnetic storm from Jupiter is so strong it can even be detected with radio (radio) radio on the Earth.</UTT>I would love to hear that. In Canada all radio stations must play 40% of Canadian music. I think it's weird law.</UTT>They have strong beaver lobbying, but that doesn't apply to Internet radio at least. There is an internet site where you can listen to classic radio dramas. Have you heard of it?</UTT>I haven't heard of it, but I would like to find it. During WWII soldiers made radios with pencils and razorblades.</UTT>You use pink pencils to automatically tune into Taylor Swift's song, not charcoal pencils. Then you receive transmissions from Finnish news stations broadcasting in classical Latin.</UTT>Haha, do you follow the government?</UTT>I learned that I never followed elephants and donkeys, or at least not by shovel.</UTT>Haha, the government owns 86 percent of the land in Nevada.</UTT>And also, it's a waste of money to buy the Eiffel Tower from a French dude who impersonates a French government representative. Best and brightest.</UTT>That's hilarious, I can't imagine doing that.</UTT>Well imagine being a Norwegian government and just spending a billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest. Now they have to decide where to store it.</UTT>That's pretty awesome what they did. Good to chat to you today. Take care.</UTT>1

Hello, who are you today? You're interesting.</UTT>Hey there, I was so impressed with the Aretha Franklin version of Amazing Grace. The sound was glorious and an epic moment.</UTT>You like music. You know that Pink Fluffy recorded a live concert in an ancient Roman amphitheater in Powellii without an audience in 1972.</UTT>Man, that's super cool. I love Pink Fluff. Wow, even in pompsonii.</UTT>I too. It's pretty cool. The Roman amphitheater used today in Croatia is still there.</UTT>That's amazing, I'm a big fan of Creed, but I actually heard they were sued for their concert. I've never seen them in person, and I'm sort of glad it happened. Have you seen them?</UTT>Wow, that's terrible, some artists of these days are pretty terrible live. They need auto tunes and whatever else they use to make them sound better.</UTT>That's a very good point. Suiting for performance is horrible, I saw the Ramones over 20 years ago and they played 223 concerts non stop for 20 years.</UTT>That's a crazy amount of concerts. I saw Linkin Park perform 324 concerts back in 2001 alone.</UTT>Wow, they are super human, I really like the Oscars too, I think Daniel Day Lewis won before, I like the people really and they are in favor of actors.</UTT>You know Walt Disney still holds the record for most man-winned Oscars, 22.</UTT>No way, I never knew that, my parents like Blazing Saddles, you know if they ever won any awards.</UTT>The Oscars are more than Leonardo Decaprio, Johnny Depp, Will Smith, George Lucas and Bill Murray combined.</UTT>That's a weird fact. I watched the time Jimmy Kimmel was hosting because he was so funny and capable of handling big shows like Academy Awards.</UTT>I like comedians hosting. Another fact is that in 2013 alone there were 9 Oscar nominations for Emma.</UTT>BTW, there are 24 different awards they hand out too.</UTT>I'm not aware of that. Another interesting fact is off topic. You know, in 1975, McDonalds added drive thrus for soldiers who were not allowed to get tof vehicles in their fatigue.</UTT>Oh that's cool, I like that. My kids are in the Navy.</UTT>Do you know that it is legal in South Africa for your car to be equipped with flame throwers to stop carjacking?</UTT>No way is that nuts. I know that Janet Marshallborough became a pro driver based on learning how to drive from a video game, isn't she wild?</UTT>Interesting. Do you know that the Cameron was named after the founder of Detroit? Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, an explorator from France?</UTT>That's a super fun fact, cool.</UTT>Nice to chat to you today.</UTT>1

Hey there, I heard about Laura Ingraham's suit, have you heard of it yet?</UTT>Yeah, I heard Laura was very demanding and fired when her assistant was pregnant.</UTT>Exactly, I guess the assistant has his first child as a factor in the lawsuit also. I guess the poor girl has to work most days of the week.</UTT>This seems to be a good case of discrimination against pregnancy due to the FMLA and her district's Protecting Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.</UTT>It sounds legit to me too. Karolina Wilson stated Laura Ingraham was not easily satisfied but she was always happy with her work.</UTT>But Ingraham let Wilson stay for 3 weeks at the company so he could get unemployment insurance. Hope this isn't just a case of disgruntled pregnant workers. What do you think?</UTT>Hmmm, that's a valid point, the report also stated that Ms. Wilson was angry that she could not have a private area to pump breast milk to her children.</UTT>The company has never denied Wilson was an efficient worker.</UTT>That sure changes things. I'm not sure I'll see Laura Ingraham keeping unhappy assistants for more than a day.</UTT>That's true. It's tricky, it seems that one person's words are most anti-other.</UTT>I totally agree. Laura Ingraham's company has less than 20 employees so I think the law will also change to smaller companies.</UTT>Apparently Ingraham gave Wilson an assignment the day he went into labor. Proving through the text is possible.</UTT>I agree!</UTT>But she could actually be a better worker's replacement.</UTT>Yeah, that's America, we support fairness. I ate lunch and remember in 1975 McDonalds added a drive thru to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing fatigue. That's fair.</UTT>Sure, it's bad that drive thrus kind of backfire and make a lot of Americans very lazy. Hahaha.</UTT>HA, that's pretty true, great point, all those hamburgers don't help obesity.</UTT>We may have to go back to before cars. It's surprising to believe that cars were just available to the masses only over a century ago. At that time most people walked and took animal-drawn carriages and carts.</UTT>Yeah, that's amazing. It's almost like a rotary phone dialing area code 212 the fastest.</UTT>I had one of those when I was little. I thought after its time, but my parents were too cheap to replace it.</UTT>That's a funny memory. Great.</UTT>I even remember using the phonebook. Do you know that two phonebooks that overlap their pages can't be separated?</UTT>1

Hello, do you like rap music?</UTT>I like Korean freestyle battles, aren't you?</UTT>I've never seen or heard it, but it sounds interesting. I like rap sometimes.</UTT>I don't know if Eminem dreamed of becoming a comic book creator one day. How do you like that street cred?</UTT>That's pretty cool, do you like Pac?</UTT>Ah, the artists listed in the congressional library as cultural significance are a mystery to me.</UTT>I guess it's powerful music. In the case of Eminem, Michigan judges gave a rape-form ruling.</UTT>Nice rhymes, rhythmic speech, street vernacular. When put into music, it might be spectacular. Uh-huh.</UTT>Yeah, pretty awesome. Do you know much about the President on another topic?</UTT>Yeah, the Indonesian President released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>I wonder if he's any good or if people just listen to his music because he's a president?</UTT>Could they call him back behind the president Banana like they would the first Zimbabwean president?</UTT>Haha good point. They can do. Do you know much about Obama?</UTT>Unfortunately. They removed all the coconuts around his destination during his visit to India.</UTT>Hmm, interesting one. If you zoom in on Google Maps in the White House, you can see him there.</UTT>FDR vetoed 635 bills while in office while President; Obama vetoed 2 bills.</UTT>That's a huge difference, do you know the codename of his secret service?</UTT>B. O.</UTT>It's actually a renegade and I'm not sure who's coming with it.</UTT>If the old rule of "finishers automatically get vice-president" is in place, it's fun to have BO run for president. Then, Romney has to be flunky.</UTT>Yeah, that's an interesting rule they had then. Nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

I think it would be interesting in basketball for the team to try and neutralize one of the best players and the Boston Celtics are actually doing their research on that right now.</UTT>I heard of LeBron James 101. Do you know it?</UTT>I don't know exactly what it is, but I do know they are trying to make sure he's not a big part of the game when he's playing, but it makes sense and I wish them luck, but I think he's just too good.</UTT>Have you watched the NBA games on TV or live?</UTT>I actually like watching NBA games on TV. Never, really, have been to NBA games. What about you?</UTT>I watched them on TV with my adult son. He liked them more than I did. I understand that the league has 30 teams.</UTT>I believe that if they do the Toronto Raptors in Canada will be the 29 teams in the United States and only one in Canada.</UTT>That's what one team in Canada is interested in. I think it's all within the US.</UTT>Yep, just one team in Canada. BTW, what do you think of granny style shooting? Scientists apparently say the best way to shoot basketball is to shoot in a basketball.</UTT>NBA players avoided doing it apparently because it looked stupid as they said.</UTT>But if I were paid $800k a year for myself like Allen Irving, I would shoot, but even if it looks stupid, it would be the best way.</UTT>I totally agree with you. Tim Duncan decided to finish college rather than go directly to the NBA after high school.</UTT>Yeah that's interesting, he definitely lost money doing that, and the NBA's original ban on the Air Jordans was interesting too.</UTT>Regarding Tim, I fear that after graduation no offers will be available. I also heard about the Air Jordans and the ban.</UTT>Yeah, it's shocking they've financated Michael Jordan, so he asked Nike and they just paid the fine so he could keep wearing the shoes.</UTT>I'm sure Nike won't lose money doing that, but that may be the contrary.</UTT>I don't know if they probably need money because of Genius Bar. What do you think of LeBron James. He probably makes a lot of money because he's in the new movie Space Jam.</UTT>That's a sequel? If so, the main actor of the original one would be the main actor?</UTT>It's a sequel. The original actor was Michael Jordan and I bet he had a comeo in it.</UTT>I see. Thanks, must be. Lebron James is a good person. He raised 60 million for charity.</UTT>He seems like a nice guy. He also rejected a $1 million offer from Reebok and only accepted a 90 million offer from Nike a year later. He appears to be a business genius.</UTT>1

The Patriots are the real power house team in the NFL.</UTT>They no longer play in Boston, they are based in Foxborough.</UTT>I know they no longer play in the Boston area. Super Bowl or Petersburg seems to be almost given every year.</UTT>They were there so many times they lost as many times as the Bills.</UTT>I'm not normally a big fan, but I might have to change Tom Brady's opinion because he came out of the Big Ten.</UTT>He didn't seem that good playing for Michigan. Who knows.</UTT>I actually don't remember him playing for Michigan.</UTT>Bradley's wife makes twice as much money as she does, but she's doing good.</UTT>That's funny, isn't it? She owns hotels and some apparel lines too.</UTT>Bradley didn't even start on his junior high team, even though they didn't win.</UTT>He's a backup quarterback at Michigan, and he's even going to have to fight for his starting spot too. I wonder what pushes him over the top.</UTT>Maybe it's because he never ate strawberries.</UTT>LOL. His strawberry might be cryptonite.</UTT>He and the coach, belichick, won 5 Super Bowls together, a lot.</UTT>It's a lot of it. He's been to the Super Bowl 8 times. I wonder if the Patriots will make it again this year.</UTT>Bradley broke ties with Charles Haley for the most Super Bowl wins if he won more.</UTT>That's awesome, maybe that's why Tom Brady is waiting to retire.</UTT>When he did he had his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen to go home. Not a bad way to retire.</UTT>Nope, I'm sure he's done a bunch of commercials and spots like Peyton Manning.</UTT>Or he may have masterminded the video game and become as good as Baker Mayfield.</UTT>That's possible. Chatting with you is fun.</UTT>1

Good Morning. I just finished placing my order with Amazon. Jeff Bezos, the company founder, has been on the news a lot lately.</UTT>Yeah, he still ranks among the top 10 richest people, but he gave up half his stuff.</UTT>And his ex was up there too. He founded Amazon in 1994. It didn't feel like it had been long ago.</UTT>First customer on Amazon.com spent $27.95 and got a building named after Amazon.com. I wish I had a building named after Amazon.com.</UTT>I just wish I had 1% of his fortune. And it's crazy to think that the Alaba Group is even larger.</UTT>I know, I want to buy into Amazon for $500 a share and now it's $1800. I kick myself every time I look at the ticker and it comes up, I got it at the early stages of that process.</UTT>That's a smart move. I tried to buy at the dip as well, but Amazon is so expensive. You know warehouse workers walk 7-15 miles a day.</UTT>I work in the Office Max warehouse and believe it. Summer is the worst part, it's not airy and you just sweat. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO, built the clock for a mountain that should run for 10,000 years.</UTT>You think if he had that kind of money he would have finalized his delivery fleet. As of now he has USPS deliver on Sunday.</UTT>He has enough to buy IMDB. I have no clue.</UTT>They sell everything from toys to electronics to furniture to food to jewelry. I even bought them a big screen TV.</UTT>You really buy TV from them, white glove service too?</UTT>Yup, the 65" Samsung, pretty sweet set, they brought it in, put it on a stand, and took away the packaging, they also sell low end products under the name Amazon Basics.</UTT>I ordered TV from them but got cold feet and didn't pull the trigger. I like their stuff basically. Amazon has surpassed the United States' third most valuable public company behind Apple and Samsung.</UTT>Pretty amazing statistics. I didn't realize they were the largest cloud infrastructure provider in the world. They just grew bigger and bigger.</UTT>I know. They are now looking for their Whole Foods store in the empty store of Sears.</UTT>I heard that as well, well, it's a pleasure to speak to you. I hope you have a great weekend.</UTT>Cs Lewis and Tolkien held a competition to laugh at you that you lost while reading terrible poetry.</UTT>I didn't realize that, but I know speed readers can process over a word per minute.</UTT>How many words can they comprehend though? I only got about 4 words.</UTT>Yeah, I'm as well. I'd have to run and get some stuff done before the NFL game comes on. Have a good day.</UTT>You too.</UTT>1

Ever watched ET?</UTT>I did. It was a movie when I was a kid.</UTT>Steven Spielberg seems to be trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. See that?</UTT>I didn't see it, did you?</UTT>I haven't either. Sound was cut out on the premiere screen but the audience cheered and made their own sound effects instead of booing.</UTT>Sure that would be nice of them to do that. I'm sure Spielberg would appreciate that.</UTT>That's usually right, the audience will be cool with that. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.</UTT>It sounds cool, my grandkids probably like it. I remember seeing it for the first time as a death scare in Jaws.</UTT>I know what you mean, the Ready Player is on the Earth where people go into virtual reality to escape their real life problems, and I can totally imagine this in the future.</UTT>Oh my god, that definitely hooks a lot of people, have you watched a lot of movies?</UTT>I really don't like Disney movies, but I do. You?</UTT>I too love Disney movies. I read they were considering shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped.</UTT>I don't even know if Sleeping Beauty flopped. Also, there was the Disney movie "Treaty Planet" and the box office flop was the most expensive of all time.</UTT>I know the Treaty Planet flopped big time, I can't remember anybody seeing it saying they liked it. I read Tom Hanks was the most box office star of all time.</UTT>You saw Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's Day? It came out in 1991. It made over $27 billion at the box office.</UTT>I remember seeing it, but it wasn't Valentine's Day.</UTT>But the Troi Wars failed. It had a budget of 1 million and only earned 309 dollars in box offices.</UTT>That's pitiful.</UTT>That's quite sad. Another sad thing is that humans only represent a minute if the history of the earth is viewed as a 24-hour period.</UTT>I read somewhere that a day is only 5 hours when the earth was formed. Awesome.</UTT>Wow, I can't even get enough done within 24 hours.</UTT>1

Hey, my friend has ever watched football on TV?</UTT>I don't follow football, but watch it occasionally.</UTT>I've been watching the Super Bowl, normally I don't watch a lot of sports, like the Patriots, have they ever fumbled the ball before? Benjarvus Green-Ellis</UTT>I don't like the Patriots. I think that's a former player and that's impressive and I wonder why this guy doesn't know more.</UTT>I agree with you, I don't really watch sports, so I'm not sure if he's a current player or not. I know they won the Emmy, they created a yellow line that showed the first down in a football game.</UTT>They're good. I heard the 222-0 is the highest in football. That's crazy.</UTT>I know right, I can't believe Georgia Tech is that much better. Once it gets 100/0, I leave it at that standing. LOL</UTT>I know right, lol.</UTT>What do you think of Eli Manning? I know he's super dominating when he's playing.</UTT>I know Elisha is short.</UTT>That's really weird. I also don't know if he was born in 1981. I've never heard of Elicia before. He also appears to have a genius level IQ.</UTT>That's amazing, is he related to Taryn Manning? She's new black from orange.</UTT>Oh, I don't know that. I've never seen that show, so I have no idea. I guess he's the younger son of the NFL quarterback, Archie Manning. A good quarterback is blood.</UTT>I don't know if he has a relationship with her, I just asked. Yeah that's interesting, I guess they just have that natural talent.</UTT>You know the NFL uses tracking chips on shoulder pads. They can track all the players' locations, positions and balls.</UTT>That's really cool, they also put it in football.</UTT>Yep you're right, they can tell ball speed, location, rotation and velocity, but I super awkwardly hope they just stop tracking after the players leave the field haha.</UTT>I guess it depends where they take that because it's on their shoulder pads.</UTT>yep, as long as they don't take that anywhere home haha, what do you think of the NFL games having only an average gameplay of about 11 minutes (which seems solo to me).</UTT>Yeah, that's crazy, there are too many timeouts, breaks, commercials.</UTT>It gets annoying after a while. I wonder if we ever had a female playing pc, do you think so? It apparently is not ruled out.</UTT>1

Do you like to watch sports?</UTT>Sometimes I don't have a lot of time to do that.</UTT>What about television in general?</UTT>Sometimes there are TV shows and movies.</UTT>I sometimes watch Simpsons. Only one episode where Bart doesn't appear and isn't mentioned.</UTT>Wow, I love cartoons like that where they show cool satire about current events.</UTT>I've never been into anime cartoons, but I know it's highly popular. There are 750 episodes of pokemon made, so I know it's highly popular.</UTT>I mean my friends always watch that, I can't ever convince myself to start, the drawing looks like manga, the only soccer cartoon I've watched is manga, and it's called Tsubasa, the captain.</UTT>Have you ever watched that 1970s show?</UTT>Maybe not one or two episodes of Ashton Kutcher fans.</UTT>It was apparently so popular they made it verbatim in the UK. But it didn't work out as it was canceled after 10 episodes.</UTT>Do they air our American show or do they make it?</UTT>They remade it word for word.</UTT>Word for word in actual English. Their accents may not be so funny.</UTT>That might be it. I sometimes try to watch NFL games but find them boring. Maybe it's because the game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>I mean, every couple of seconds, the game is interrupted. I can't watch that, my blood boils when I do it. LOL</UTT>That's true, our society takes football so seriously that the tracking chips are embedded in shoulder pads and football.</UTT>I heard that, what exactly does that really help?</UTT>I'm not sure if it's for data or to help ensure everything is fair.</UTT>I'm not sure either. What do you think of female players joining the game?</UTT>I think it would be great if they could meet the requirements for qualification.</UTT>1

Hello, what would you like to do for entertainment?</UTT>Hi, I love entertainment, I like the NFL as well as it gets, it doesn't have written rules for girls to play.</UTT>That's pretty cool, I wonder if the women will join soon. Average games with only 11 minutes of live gameplay are pretty crazy.</UTT>Yeah, that's surprising, football players don't actually make all that much money. Engineers make more in a lifetime.</UTT>Yeah, that's also surprising, and the NFL uses a tracking chip to track players and football.</UTT>Oh that's cool, hope we get more information on how to protect players. Kind of interesting that the Saints cheerladers can't eat in the same restaurant as the players.</UTT>I think that's a kinda silly rule.</UTT>I agree. I also like to play video games and used to have NES nintendo. It can only display 54 colors but impressed me.</UTT>The NES was discontinued in Japan in 2003. I also like to play it and still have the NES.</UTT>That's awesome Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because the entertainment executives said he didn't look like he was president. He knows little.</UTT>That's funny, and Bill Nye made it in the entertainment industry by winning a similar contest with Steve Martin.</UTT>Wow, interesting. I think if I played football I would want to be the quarterback. I want to call the play in the huddle.</UTT>Oh, cool Paul d. Hubbard created the huddle. He was deaf. He used his hands so that other teams could not read his signals.</UTT>That's a cool origin story of a huddle. QB Alex Smith got his degree after 2 years in college because he took so many AP classes.</UTT>That was pretty impressive. Kelan Moore is the only left-wing quarterback in the NFL.</UTT>Wow, now all the quarterbacks are right handed, I think it is. Tom Brady's high school had a bad season when he never won a game or scored a touchdown. Bay was the back up and didn't even play. Hard to believe.</UTT>Hard to believe that. Now look at him.</UTT>Football is a tough game. They have played 17 straight weeks of the season, only one week off.</UTT>Yeah, it's gonna happen, I can't ever do it, well, it's nice to talk to you, have a good day.</UTT>You as well. Have a good day.</UTT>SetC-WP-01</UTT>1

Are you playing golf?</UTT>Sure did. I try to hit the link every month or so at least. Do what you do.</UTT>I do, I like being outdoors, and the different courses.</UTT>I also loved playing Mario golf as a kid back in the day.</UTT>Playing golf on a video game can solve the water consumption issue.</UTT>I bet it uses a lot of water for sprinklers to water courses.</UTT>The course uses 312,000 gallons of water a day in the US. Isn't it kind of wasteful?</UTT>That's insanely wasteful. I hope they somehow recycle their water.</UTT>I don't think they can recycle water when it's on a course, but the rich like to play golf, so Dubai has a golf course.</UTT>Sam Jackson often gets to play and makes sure his contacts with the film allow him to play twice a week.</UTT>Celebrities like Babe Ruth, the most famous golfer, like to play golf.</UTT>Back in his day, there are so many more famous players nowadays.</UTT>Would you like to watch golf, or just play Mario golf?</UTT>Snooze watching it. I'd rather play it. You?</UTT>I don't like watching golf for entertainment, as you say, because it's boring. But each prefers people. In Roman times people bred chickens for entertainment.</UTT>That sounds boring to me now.</UTT>If it bores you, you can eat your chicken.</UTT>Well, I guess that's big up for it haha. Do you know that the original NES could only show 52 colors?</UTT>I think it's 54, but what they can do is really impress me, only 54 is the color they can do. That could have caused them to still sell it in 2003.</UTT>You're right, it's 54 years old, huge success on its own day.</UTT>What games are you in favor of on the Nintendo entertainment system?</UTT>I'm a big fan of MegaMan, what about you?</UTT>I like race games but Mega Man is really good. I've always started Metal Man.</UTT>Get that metal blade as early as possible.</UTT>1

Still have a chance to listen to the radio?</UTT>Hello there, I found a really good local station I like. What would you suggest?</UTT>I do. Do you know that the storm on Jupiter was so strong it was possible to hear it on AM radio?</UTT>I thought I'd read about that before. That's really amazing.</UTT>I agree. You are aware that you can make radios with very little?</UTT>I think so because I think WW2 soldiers made them using razorblades and pencils.</UTT>They do. They call them foxhole radios.</UTT>Good call. I think any information or any form of entertainment is well welcomed.</UTT>I'm sure it is. Have you heard of the old radio dramas that were very popular before TV?</UTT>I don't think I have, but I know of a website where you can listen to tons of them for free.</UTT>There, I wonder if they still hold up.</UTT>I bet they do, but they are still dating. I think some real gems are hiding in that bunch.</UTT>You are probably right. Do you know that 40% of the Canadian music played on Canadian radio legally has to be Canadian?</UTT>I think I've heard that, it sounds pretty funny, but I bet the Canadian bands like it.</UTT>I imagine so. Are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>I don't. I think most politics just fight to stay in the position..?</UTT>I agree with you but also think it is important, so it is interesting. You know that the President became a vice-president until 1805. Now imagine that.</UTT>That's very true, isn't that wild and it's a reality show?</UTT>It's crazy. You know what to call the first Zimbabwean president on the lighter side?</UTT>I think he was called Banana the President. I think that's because his actual name is the reason for the call.</UTT>He is. I'm not sure if that is his birth name.</UTT>1

Enjoy the music?</UTT>I love music, what would you suggest?</UTT>I enjoy country music.</UTT>I like country music as well, but I don't like it, but I enjoy some of it. Is it also called western and hillbilly music?</UTT>Some say it has become popular because Ford helped finance the spread of it out of fear of jazz.</UTT>Only two African Americans are in the hall of fame of country music, so I guess it doesn't benefit everyone. Still enjoying it.</UTT>I wonder if it's a talent or a race issue.</UTT>I'm not sure, there's just some music for everyone. I can't do heavy hard core metal and I don't like rap music today.</UTT>I think some rap is OK, but I agree with heavy metal. It's just a pain to hear that music, but hey, it's a subjective topic. The original intent of the Fender stratocaster was country music.</UTT>George Strait and Jeff Beezos are cousins.</UTT>Amazing coincidence so enjoy listening to music on the radio or on an album?</UTT>Radio is probably. You suggested.</UTT>Actually, I only listen to the albums, I never really use the radio.</UTT>Do you know of storms on Jupiter that can be picked up by minute radio due to their strength?</UTT>I wonder if you can pick up a kind of sound. I wonder if foxhole radios can pick up Jupiter's storm as well.</UTT>Not sure about that. Radio and technology have come a long way.</UTT>I wonder if it still is used often in day to day life. I know there is a website where I can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free, but I'm really not sure how many people use it today.</UTT>40% of Canada's radio music is made law.</UTT>I guess that's one way to encourage the use of Canadian radio. I'm not sure how many people in Canada use it.</UTT>Do you like Lindin Park?</UTT>I think they are playing wonderful music, especially their hybrid theory of albums.</UTT>You know it is the most sold album of the 21st century. Wow.</UTT>That is indeed why I checked it out. In any case, thanks for the enjoyable chat.</UTT>1

Hey, you like baseball by the way. What do you think of the Nationals?</UTT>I'm a big baseball fan, I think they did ok, even though they lost Barry Harper. Kinda the same situation as they lost Jason Wallace a few years ago.</UTT>As for speaking about baseball, do you know that a baseball manager can actually play for a team if needed?</UTT>Interesting to see that. That's one rule I don't know.</UTT>That's why they wear uniforms, and it's also weird people know soccer baseball in Canada.</UTT>That's interesting too. The married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games until 2005.</UTT>Seems like a lot of work like that. Do you know why they stopped? A guy who found millions of baseball cards in his attic was a very lucky dude.</UTT>I don't know why they stopped working. I know I would stop working if I found a million dollar baseball card worth lol</UTT>Yep, I can think of a lot to do with a million dollars, and I would be very happy my grandfather had them in the attic.</UTT>Yes, no doubt, do you know that the Women's World Cup is rated higher on TV than the US series?</UTT>I don't know if that's crazy, baseball is also super popular in Japan, they even think it's their national pastime and not ours lol</UTT>LOL Babe Ruth, a home run nerd, was caught stealing to end the 7th game of the 1926 world series. Interesting stat, unusable.</UTT>Haha interesting stats, have you ever watched Game of Two? I know that's a topic change.</UTT>I saw it but didn't follow closely. I know Ireland is financing it because they film scenes in Ireland which boosts tourism income.</UTT>You're right, I think it will premiere for the first time in 2011, long ago it seems. I didn't wait for the new season to start in April.</UTT>Next season supposed to be like last season, right?</UTT>iii It's the last one. i forgot about Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter, but it's actually crazy that she's on the game of tony.</UTT>Wow, I never knew that, so neat. I had to binge on it and catch up before the beginning of the last season. I heard the name was rising fastest with Game of Two.</UTT>Haha, you're right about that, you should definitely check it out, they even made the Game of Lions knock off series lol.</UTT>That's funny, I saw Harry Lloyd, the great grandson of Charles Dickens, there. It's neat they have two people related to famous people long ago.</UTT>Yep, I agree with you. Even Charles Dickens' great grandson was a guy. LOL. They have everyone on the show.</UTT>1

Hi, look forward to chatting with you.</UTT>I'm too. What do you think of the new NFL rules?</UTT>What is the new rule?</UTT>As to quarterbacks being running or passing people and how to handle hitting.</UTT>I think everybody got used to it in time. You know Tom Brady's wife Gisele Bundchen made her salary more than double.</UTT>Wow, that's not what you know. You see, Tom Brady's high school team had the worst season ever, with no touchdown scorches and never trying to bring in their own back up QB.</UTT>What, that sounds silly, why did they do that?</UTT>No clue. It's crazy that Kelly Moore is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.</UTT>I heard that, but I don't believe that. More like that must happen.</UTT>You think so, but then why is that a fact? Even crazy that a No Saints cheerleader would have to leave a restaraunt if the Saints players came in.</UTT>Why is that? They don't have to hang out together.</UTT>I know right, I guess they don't want to fratinize.</UTT>I don't mind watching.</UTT>What's watching?</UTT>Fraternity. Sorry, I always see things with a sexual twist. LOL</UTT>LOL You dude, lol</UTT>We are pigs, at least honest pigs.</UTT>Let's see how they use tracking chips on pads and footballs.</UTT>I mean, I mean that's red, but how does that help the actual game?</UTT>Statistics, you know what statistics are in the game. Like only 11 minutes of gameplay.</UTT>Yeah, that's one of the reasons I don't really watch the game. It keeps being interrupted.</UTT>True, but I still watch. One day, females could play because they didn't rule.</UTT>Why should a rule like that be, and why is it interesting?</UTT>Definitely, but then you have to build a separate locker room for them. lol</UTT>Come on, gender equality in sport, it's no way they'll change with the boy lol</UTT>Yeah right, feminists have their day in the field, Tom Brady's wife makes more than she does lol.</UTT>Yeah, google her look and understand.</UTT>Not necessary, get her out of my brain, alright, have a good one.</UTT>1

I'm a huge NFL fan, mad at the Patriots winning the Superbowl this year. I love the NFL because it's the highest professional football level in the world.</UTT>I can't say I'm a huge fan. I know my local team, but not much more. I used to live in DC and now in Cleveland. I fully realize how sucky the Browns are.</UTT>Oh nice, they definitely have trouble lol. Never play football. I didn't, but I wanted to be a quarterback because the offensive leader.</UTT>I never played other soccer football. Are you aware of this player, Derrius Guard, and his injuries?</UTT>Oh nice, that's a good game as well, yeah he tore the leg cruciate ligament so badly, he was disaster to himself, terrible knee injury, he was hyperextension when tackled, ouch.</UTT>I've always heard players do the ACL and I've never really known what that means.</UTT>It is the ligament that prevents the thigh bone from moving anteriorly in the leg. It is very common and very bad that corrective surgery is necessary. He has denied that he can walk after some sadness that he didn't want his rookie season to end.</UTT>I'm sure he gets the best treatment. Watch the Super Bowl this year. Even if you want the Patriots to lose.</UTT>I do. Not a great game with very low scoring. Commercials are good though. If you watch a throne game you watch the Patriots like the Lannisters of the NFL.</UTT>My niece always had a birthday party that weekend and we felt obliged to go with her because of her family. My wife loves Game of Two so I ended up watching with her. I assume it wasn't a good thing.</UTT>Oh nice. The Lannies always held power and wanted control and power, and Bill Beckich's Patriots coach won the most in the postseason in the NFL quite respectably.</UTT>All that spy stuff with them, and the gate deflated?</UTT>That's a huge scandal. They were put on some probation for that, but about it. Do you know that there is only one left wing quarterback in the NFL?</UTT>I wonder if it makes a difference. I know left handed can have advantages in some sports. Funny Tom Brady can't make his own high school at times.</UTT>Yeah, that's a good point, it's hard to believe that now, he's considered the greatest quarterback of all time. That shows that natural ability isn't everything; the deaf quarterback appears to be creating a football huddle. Pretty interesting.</UTT>I didn't realize that Beckett was the Browns coach. Cleveland won a playoff game a long time ago.</UTT>Oh yeah, I don't know that either. They sure have tough going. Wow, their last playoff win was in 1995.</UTT>That was before they moved to Baltimore. I know there is a lot of bad blood around here for that. Is Canadian football much different?</UTT>Yeah, I'm not sure what a good question to ask. The CFL is definitely different, but I'm not sure what exactly. I know Dwayne Johnson was actually cut from the CFL before he started wrestling.</UTT>He looks like a football player. Who are your favorite NFL teams?</UTT>I'm a Seahawks fan, I'm from them. Also, the Patriots beat us a few years ago, so I don't like them.</UTT>I heard you have a noisy stadium, is that true?</UTT>I went to the game before and it was deafening. You can't even hear the talk. Great time, but I'd rather watch the game on TV, just because it's more comfortable.</UTT>Have a good day and good bye.</UTT>Bye, too!</UTT>Bye.</UTT>1

The Good Place of Kriston Bell's TV show sounds interesting. I haven't seen it, but I heard it was very funny.</UTT>I've seen the first season, great, very funny.</UTT>What do you think of the plot twist at the end of the season? That seems hilarious.</UTT>I don't expect something definitive. It's super funny when she's in heaven and heaven censors all her curses (lol).</UTT>Then I thought I'd have to watch it. That sounds hysterical. Has the second season come out yet?</UTT>It has. I just started watching it. It's kind of frustrating though. I guess I have to keep watching.</UTT>How is it frustrating? Is it a re-hashing of the first season?</UTT>No, Michael reset them at the end of the first season. They have no memory, they figure out who they are, they find out Michael, they reset them again, etc.</UTT>Get it. Does it seem to be a comment on religion or God? I heard it seemed like an analogy of heaven/hell?</UTT>They definitely touched God and it was set in heaven/hell. From what I remember, religion wasn't mentioned at all.</UTT>Cool, I'm a Christian with a well developed sense of humor, but don't like overtly disparaging comments. There's enough trash on TV without adding it.</UTT>It's made with good taste, really fun comedy Kriston Bell is amazing you watch a lot of TV you know there is only one episode of The Simpsons where Bart doesn't appear and isn't mentioned.</UTT>I really don't watch much TV to be honest. We cut the cord a few years ago. That's interesting about Simpsons. I've not seen that show for years but I don't remember any shows that didn't have Bart. I have to try and find a show that does.</UTT>Yeah, I'm too.</UTT>Do you remember the 3rd Rock from the Sun in 1997 winning the golden globe for best comedy (interesting TV trivia speaking) - I don't remember.</UTT>I don't remember that either, but that show is so fun. It's about 50 episodes a straight 16 years.</UTT>LOL There is so much TV and movie trivia out there! It's amazing to think that in just a couple of generations, television and film will really become such an integral part of our popular culture.</UTT>I know right, and there are way too many good shows for you to even keep up with.</UTT>Exactly. Sometimes when I search Netflix or Amazon for something to watch it takes 15 minutes or 1 minute to find it. So many choices and I can only see what they actually have in their library.</UTT>lol I'm right, I tried and went to my friend's recommendation (which I couldn't deal with) and it passed an hour and I still haven't found anything.</UTT>Same here, but I like the feature "watch X" It helps me find additional programs like I know I like.</UTT>Nice talk to you, have a good one. I hope you enjoy The Good Life.</UTT>1
The Good Place of Kriston Bell's TV show sounds interesting.</UTT>I've seen the first season, great, very funny.</UTT>That seems hilarious.</UTT>I don't expect something definitive. It's super funny when she's in heaven and heaven censors all her curses (lol).</UTT>Then I thought I'd have to watch it. That sounds hysterical. Has the second season come out yet?</UTT>It has. I just started watching it. It's kind of frustrating though. I guess I have to keep watching.</UTT>How is it frustrating? Is it a re-hashing of the first season?</UTT>No, Michael reset them at the end of the first season. They have no memory, they figure out who they are, they find out Michael, they reset them again, etc.</UTT>Get it. Does it seem to be a comment on religion or God? I heard it seemed like an analogy of heaven/hell?</UTT>They definitely touched God and it was set in heaven/hell.</UTT>Cool, I'm a Christian with a well developed sense of humor, but don't like overtly disparaging comments. There's enough trash on TV without adding it.</UTT>It's made with good taste really fun comedy Kriston Bell is amazing you watch a lot of TV.</UTT>I really don't watch much, to be honest I cut myself a few years ago about Simpsons. I didn't see an integral show for years but I don't remember shows that didn't have Bart. It must be good to find one.</UTT>I too.</UTT>Do you remember the 3rd Rock from the Sun in 1997 winning the golden globe for best comedy (interesting TV trivia speaking) - I don't remember.</UTT>I don't remember that either, but that show is so fun. It's about 50 episodes a straight 16 years.</UTT>LOL There is so much TV and movie trivia out there! It's amazing to think that in just a couple of generations, television and film will really become such an integral part of our popular culture.</UTT>I know right, and there are way too many good shows for you to even keep up with.</UTT>Exactly. Sometimes when I search Netflix or Amazon for something to watch it takes 15 minutes or 1 minute to find it. So many choices and I can only see what they actually have in their library.</UTT>lol I'm right, I tried and went to my friend's recommendation (which I couldn't deal with) and it passed an hour and I still haven't found anything.</UTT>Same here, but I like the feature "watch X" It helps me find additional programs like I know I like.</UTT>Nice talk to you, have a good one.

Good Morning.</UTT>Good morning, how do you feel about a safe movement in space?</UTT>I've never heard of it to be honest. What is it about?</UTT>It's where kids are free to be bullied and stuff like that. Sometimes it's blown out that kids should have it easy but that's not really the case.</UTT>I don't think so. How does not allowing bullying make kids soft?</UTT>I guess they are claiming kids need to learn to deal with adversity and stick up for themselves. I just think we all need to be nicer.</UTT>I get that I agree with you. I must tolerate bullying of my son. It stops when he stands up on his own. But it should at all. I think it is wrong.</UTT>I agree. I teach martial arts and we just teach kids to be strong and confident, but people don't pick on strong and confident people.</UTT>That's a great thing to do. I fish for kids. I get to know the county really. Do you fish?</UTT>I don't. I have a hard time touching them because they are so slimy.</UTT>They can. Kids love it, but do you know that freshwater fish drink water by osmosis and not by mouth?</UTT>That's pretty cool. I know of an immortal jellyfish breed.</UTT>That's wild, isn't it? Scientists studied it too. 87% of human genes were also found in zebra fish. I wonder if they got Common Cold?</UTT>It can also help us cure things. It can board those jellyfish and start trying to cure cancer.</UTT>That is wonderful God. I read that seahorses are only fish with necks too.</UTT>I guess I never thought that before, but it makes sense.</UTT>Just a fun little fact I heard on the radio. Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Sometimes, but more about podcasts right now. There is so much variety on radio though.</UTT>I don't listen to many podcasts. I'm looking to listen to the storm on Jupiter. Is there a website for them?</UTT>I just listen on Podcoin, you collect points for the podcasts you too listen to. I want to hear the Jupiter storm, I bet they'll be interesting.</UTT>I must have looked into that. I looked up a website where you can listen to old radio dramas. It was really funny.</UTT>That's cool, I'll have to check that out then. It sounds interesting.</UTT>I listened to the horror one, butt, laughed it off. They were like the 30's. Do you know that they had to play 40% Canadian music?</UTT>I heard that. I guess they jammed out Bieber and Drake all day.</UTT>And Celine Dion. Have a good day.</UTT>1

Hi, do you like dancing?</UTT>I did, but I wasn't great. Do you know that Pac did a ballet in high school?</UTT>I heard that. I guess he's a talented guy in many ways.</UTT>I agree. I guess a professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week.</UTT>I figure ballet has to be hard on the feet too. I don't want to do it. Then I can't do it again.</UTT>I don't either. Do you know that babies spontaneously dance when they hear dance music? We can really see a lot of entertaining videos on the internet.</UTT>quite true, much more entertainment in our lives, I wonder if it's good, but...</UTT>Well, I know that the constant novelty of clicking links on the internet may cause real brain-measured addiction.</UTT>I believe that. Anything that releases chemicals can become addictive.</UTT>I'm not sure. Hard to believe that Mount Everest is a peak with three gigabit cell service and Internet capability.</UTT>I believe it. People need to upload their own selfies. Great opportunity to show off to your followers.</UTT>I guess so. How Facebook has changed our lives is amazing. Hard to believe it was launched on April 4, 2004.</UTT>Yeah, it changed a lot of lives, it probably caused a lot of divorces too.</UTT>Hard to believe Myspace turned down an offer in early 2005 to buy Facebook for 75 million dollars.</UTT>Yeah, they missed their chance to get it for a bargain. I wonder how the facebook turned out then.</UTT>I never thought about it that way, but yeah, it's funny that Burger King has a promotion that offers Whopper to you if you're not unfriended with 10 people on facebook. Too funny a promotion.</UTT>I wonder how many people participated in that campaign. Free calories to dump your friends.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder, you know FB is primarily blue because the founders are blind to red and green?</UTT>I heard that Mark should spend some money to find a cure. Great chat anyway.</UTT>I wonder if there is a cure. I'm surprised Facebook allowed anyone who claimed 13 years to get an account.</UTT>Pretty young for social media, have a good day.</UTT>I agree, have a good day as well, bye</UTT>1

Hi, are you a fan of the Patriots American football team?</UTT>I'm not a fan, but I don't hate them either. I see that their owner, Kitch, is just getting into trouble.</UTT>I heard that. I'm also not a fan, but Brady deserves respect.</UTT>Bryan is probably the best quarterback in NFL history. I think the sport is declining. I'm a fan, but the younger generation doesn't watch it as much.</UTT>I didn't notice it. I think selfish fools like Kaepernick hurt the game by bringing their politics into the pastimes people go for to avoid such things.</UTT>I'm sure that won't help, most people can't stand politics.</UTT>It seems that everything is politics now. It's sick. I bet the Pats fans aren't sick of the fact that they're effective in the red zone.</UTT>Do you know that the only live NFC game is 11 minutes?</UTT>I can believe it. I played in high school and stood around a lot. The injury really hurts the game, like that about Ty Hilton, who was pretty banged up by the Texans.</UTT>Yeah, I wasn't aware that the NFL uses chips to track players during games, wasn't it?</UTT>I heard that. Now they put a chip in everything. Like Drew Brees? He thinks every number is for exercise.</UTT>Is this interesting for the Saints quarterback?</UTT>Yep, he's a dude, but the NFL doesn't have a rule on women playing. Sorry Drew.</UTT>Interesting, I also know that the NFL has only one left handed quarterback these days. What do you do?</UTT>Yeah, it's not like a baseball pitcher. Funny how the Bills and Pats tied to lose the Superbowl.</UTT>I can believe that, they are in a lot of Super Bowl games when I'm younger.</UTT>You know circular huddles originate because the quarterback is deaf. I think they facilitate verbal communication.</UTT>I didn't know that to hide the hand signals.</UTT>Yeah, back to your point about the NFL declining, the quarterback actually considered giving up football to go into competitive gaming, will we be heroes in the future?</UTT>Interesting, Twitch is pretty popular and I'm not surprised.</UTT>Thanks for the chat.</UTT>1

Hey there, do you know JFK is one of the wealthiest US Presidents?</UTT>I don't know, but I know George Washington is one as well. I wonder where JFK got all his money from. I mean the type of business his family is in.</UTT>I'm right, I'd like to know that too, I know Washington and Jefferson have slaves, I don't know what JFK did.</UTT>There are a lot of neat facts floating around about the president. You know that the vice president became finished until 1805. All the tensions that that created can only be imagined.</UTT>Haha, that's wild with President Trump and Hillary, talk about drama and dysfunction.</UTT>Oh they went with it like cats and dogs, they might make some fun interviews though lol. You know the Indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Wow, that impressed. I always say that Trump and Hillary should release albums to heal political wounds and then donate money to charities.</UTT>I just can't imagine that two people singing either. Heck, I can't really imagine a president who has been in office for the past few years. I've heard some funny impressions of some impersonators singing Bill Clinton though.</UTT>Hahaha, and he at least plays saxophone so he can still participate.</UTT>Now weird they say Zimbabwe's president is called banana. I'm not sure if the top banana means something else there, but I think it's interesting.</UTT>That's why I thought I'd look it up and he was actually the last banana named.</UTT>Ah, that makes sense, I still like my Top Banana theory lol, you know the Senate has the same gavel for 165 years, that thing is being built to last now.</UTT>Hahahaha, they had the same gavel until Nixon cracked it, bad omen.</UTT>Wonder if he just banged it a bit too hard or was angry at something? Nixon struck me as a lot of annoying guys. Hehe.</UTT>Haha he definitely has temporals and it's very dumb that women can't wear pants in the Senate until 1993.</UTT>Yeah, I heard they were staging protests to change that. I guess it was good because Hillary couldn't wear her favorite pantsuits.</UTT>That's funny and good for Michael and Braun, that takes courage to protest, I'm sure. lol</UTT>They say the Senate has a tradition of candy desks. Any senator sitting near a busy entrance must keep a drawer full of candy. A senator is worth it right there.</UTT>That makes me hungry. And all the candy from Pennsylvania appears. Mmmmm, hahaha.</UTT>It's weird you know that it took 4 days for the Secret Service to realize that the bullets were fired in the White House on November 11, 2011. Granted, that thing can still travel pretty far.</UTT>Wow, that's very wild. You think they're ball on that. BTW, GWB put solar panels in the White House.</UTT>1

Hello, do you like radio?</UTT>I'm a big fan of radio, what's the coolest website to stream all classical radio dramas for free?</UTT>Yeah that's cool. Have you got a chance to check it out?</UTT>I haven't yet, but I have some very old Christian radio drama on what radio hourly from 2pm.</UTT>That's cool, I heard a jupiter storm was possible on the radio.</UTT>I do too, and wonder what station you tune in to pick up the radio storm on Jupiter?</UTT>I have no clue, hope you know. LOL</UTT>I had to google it. It's pretty funny. Canadian radio has to play 40% of the songs Canadian artists sing, because of the law.</UTT>That's very patriotic about them, do you like animals?</UTT>Cool animals, over 1.5 million species live on earth are crazy.</UTT>That's crazy, over 2 billion animals, and zero in at 1 billion lol.</UTT>No clue, most of those animals are insect scared.</UTT>Ugh, you've ever watched naked and afraid. They're always eaten by millions of mosquitoes first night, it looks annoying, it's on TV, lol.</UTT>Yea, if I were German, I would exclude insects from the legal rights of animals guaranteed by the constitution.</UTT>LOL I agree, the Lochness is a protected species in Scotland, do you believe it exists?</UTT>But I wish the monster, Loch Ness, would do. Either way, I guess it would be good to protect it in just the case.</UTT>Do you know that the planet is a precipitation of glass shards?</UTT>Sounds terrifying, Venus lacks seasons.</UTT>LOL, the cold sounds.</UTT>Depends on whether Venus' face is brutally cold or incredible hot.</UTT>Oh right.</UTT>Well, I'll have to go. I'll have a nice chat with you.</UTT>1

Hey there, do you use Facebook? What do you think of Mark Kapperberg?</UTT>I think he's a dude in charge of a massively different product he's anticipated.</UTT>I can see that also. I never knew he was colorblind and that's why Facebook is blue.</UTT>That's an interesting factoid.</UTT>You know that Ireland wrote its constitution on Facebook. People can also suggest and alter it on Facebook pages.</UTT>That's an interesting way to keep a living document. Do they have age restrictions because you can legally be 13 and be on facebook?</UTT>That's a great point. We don't want people to put Fortnite or something like a video game in the constitution. Have you heard about the Burger King promotion on facebook?</UTT>The content they pay for may be out of hand. I usually ignore ads.</UTT>I do too. If you unfriend 10 people on facebook you get a free Whopper. This alerts people you are not friends with and only one tenth of Whopper is worth it haha.</UTT>That's funny, I tote people so I don't be friends with the whopper. I like people way more than I do people.</UTT>I do that too. Wish I could do that right now and get some food starving. Crazy how Facebook values over 1.4 billion. You can buy a lot of Whoppers.</UTT>I do use some of the $1 billion in pie too though, for hershey pie.</UTT>Yeah, I can see that too. Now you're watching NFC at all?</UTT>Heck yeah, I think it's crazy that Blockbuster doesn't take them seriously.</UTT>Blockbuster definitely made no big mistakes there. Very sad that they had a chance to buy them for $5 million and now Netflix is worth over $2 billion.</UTT>I think it's cool that they track illegal downloads to know what title they have.</UTT>I think that is actually a good strategy. I think it's funny that Netflix started because the guy had a copy of Apollo 13 late.</UTT>I thought I would fall asleep watching it. I'm glad they have so many good rated rotten tomatoes movies.</UTT>That makes life easy for me. It's very crazy that NFC make up about 1/3 of all the bandwidth in North America. That's an insane amount.</UTT>How much it is watched wild compared to traditional TV.</UTT>I agree with you. I don't even watch normal TV personally, but at this point only watch Netflix.</UTT>1

Also, people are alerted if you don't mistake them and yeah, one hundredth of Whopper is worth it.</UTT>That's funny, I tote people so I don't be friends with the whopper.

I think it's funny that Netflix started because the guy had an Apollo 13 copy late, hey there, preserve facebook? How do you feel about Mark Kapperberg?</UTT>I thought I would fall asleep watching it. I'm glad they have so many good rated rotten tomatoes movies.</UTT>That makes life easy for me.

Are you familiar with theater?</UTT>I actually am. Do you like Shakespeare and his playing?</UTT>Nice, as far as the words go, I like Shakespeare. I have no idea how one can accomplish so much and win so many awards in the theater. This guy in Section 3 won 8 awards for acting in theater. Amazing.</UTT>neat, managinds did that for him. Do you know that shookspeare and phontas lived at the same time?</UTT>That's an amazing fact. They only appear to have died a year apart as well. The playwright also invented the names Miranda, Jesus and Olivia.</UTT>That's so cool, do you know he intentionally erred in grammar?</UTT>Such a genius. His plays have been translated into every major living language and appear to have performed more than any other.</UTT>Overall he's just amazing. He did that to get his audience to attend.</UTT>I agree, I have no idea he was married. He also married Anne Hathaway and had three children. A man certainly lives a life.</UTT>Sure, there are 33 Shakespeare gardens in the world.</UTT>Fascinating, I'm from an area that has a Shakespeare Festival every year, it's amazing, the real human skull used for a few Hamlet performances is so crazy.</UTT>Yeah, you know who the skull belongs to.</UTT>a href="http://www.themusical.com/articles/Andre-Tchaikowsky-Poland-composing-andre-tchaikowsky-composing-andre-tchaikowsky">Poland composer André Tchaikowsky/a> He donated it so it could be used that way.</UTT>Granting him wishes is a good thing.</UTT>I find it fascinating. Shakespeare apparently coined the terms and phrases we use today: laugh stock, good riddance, brave new world. Man changed culture with words.</UTT>Sure he did. Have you ever watched an Academy Award?</UTT>Never. I've heard of them. I feel that 24 awards are a generic way of praising someone.</UTT>And they were even nominated for the 9 Emmys.</UTT>Who was nominated for the 9 Emmys?</UTT>Oscars. I don't even know what category.</UTT>It's weird, to be honest, that I have so many different ideas about the award ceremony.</UTT>I'm in. Nice chat.</UTT>1
Are you familiar with theater?</UTT>I actually am. Do you like Shakespeare and his playing?</UTT>Nice, as far as the words go, I like Shakespeare. I have no idea how one can accomplish so much and win so many awards in the theater. This guy in Section 3 won 8 awards for acting in theater. Amazing.</UTT>neat, managinds can do that for him, did you change what shakespeare and pahontas got at a time that changed?</UTT>That's an amazing fact. They only appear to have died a year apart as well. The playwright also invented the names Miranda, Jesus and Olivia.</UTT>That's so cool, do you know he intentionally erred in grammar?</UTT>Such a genius. His plays have been translated into every major living language and appear to have performed more than any other.</UTT>Overall he's just amazing. He did that to get his audience to attend.</UTT>I agree, I have no idea he was married. He also married Anne Hathaway and had three children. A man certainly lives a life.</UTT>Sure, there are 33 Shakespeare gardens in the world.</UTT>Fascinating, I'm from an area that has a Shakespeare Festival every year, it's amazing, the real human skull used for a few Hamlet performances is so crazy.</UTT>Yeah, you know who the skull belongs to.</UTT>a href="http://www.themusical.com/articles/Andre-Tchaikowsky-Poland-composing-andre-tchaikowsky-composing-andre-tchaikowsky">Poland composer André Tchaikowsky/a> He donated it so it could be used that way.</UTT>Granting him wishes is a good thing.</UTT>I find it fascinating.

Hi, have you ever watched soccer?</UTT>You mean football, I love it.</UTT>Hahaha sorry it's football, I just don't want to confuse it with the type. Do you have a team in your favor?</UTT>I really don't, I just got it for the World Cup, I guess fair weather fans. Hahaha.</UTT>You can't blame yourself. The World Cup is really exciting and I only watch it, too. Sometimes I root for a team just to hype it though.</UTT>You can't go wrong with Mexico or Brazil. You know the US was placed in the first World Cup in 1930.</UTT>I don't know about that. I heard the US women's World Cup team was pretty stellar.</UTT>Football is the most popular sport in the world played in more than 200 countries. I'm in Thailand and they have no idea what American football is.</UTT>Amazing how far sport has come. I don't think there are other single sports that have the same international audience.</UTT>That's definitely hard to beat with 25 million players.</UTT>I wonder if they count junior players among those 250 million people. If they do, I'd be one of them as a kid.</UTT>I've never played and have a nephew who plays and loves him. Have you heard of 3 team matches at one time?</UTT>I can't imagine how three teams would work. It sounds complicated and doesn't work on a standard rectangular pitch.</UTT>I'm not exactly sure, but it's fun to watch it.</UTT>I would love to see some top FIFA teams try to play that way. It would be interesting to see them adapt to new fields seeing as how they practice so much normal games.</UTT>I went to a game in the Patriots stadium last year. It was a great time.</UTT>Calling the association football team the Patriots too? I've only ever heard of American football teams and I don't think the stadium can be used for both.</UTT>New England Patriots are a football team and their stadium is also home to the Major Soccer League team New England Revolution.</UTT>I have no idea. Cool that they share a name like that. See what they're playing at?</UTT>I don't remember to be honest.</UTT>No worries, sports are sometimes so exciting and energetic that details slip into my mind too.</UTT>1

Hey, you're a fan of Brent Cobb?</UTT>I'm actually not sure he's a person, you can tell me how I should know him.</UTT>He is a country singer/writer - his shyness almost prevented him from reaching stardom.</UTT>I heard of him. He's from Georgia, right?</UTT>ELLAVILLE, GA. Because he grew up in a musical family, music is in his blood.</UTT>I wonder if he collects his family albums. Do you still have any physical albums or is everyone online now?</UTT>If I had a CD of the 90's probably lost in the attic or basement, I would have any. What about you?</UTT>I still collect vinyl records. I would love a copy of Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl. It was one of the best selling albums a few 40 years ago, but it was recorded a few years ago.</UTT>That's a good album. I don't think it's as good as Pink Fluffy, but it's kind of interesting that Linkin Park has the best sales of the 21st century.</UTT>Definitely. It's surprising how long cassettes last compared to compact discs.</UTT>I guess technology is getting more advanced around the time CDs are out. Are you a fan of the National Wall Academy?</UTT>Heck yeah, Straight Outta Compton is a classic that never got a lot of radio play.</UTT>Strange that it is considered popular. The first album reached platinum status without support from radio play or major tours.</UTT>Well, I doubt they play much in Canada, they have 40 percent of Canadian artists radio played.</UTT>They probably played Drake 95% of the time. Radio is quite interesting isn't it? Nowadays it seems pretty simple on a surface level.</UTT>Do you know that Jupiter is a storm so strong it can be heard from AM radio?</UTT>I thought I'd heard that somewhere before. I know WW2 soldiers created foxhole radios simply using razorblades and pencils as diodes.</UTT>That's nuts. I wonder if they could pick up the storm on Jupiter.</UTT>Haha, they probably didn't know about the storm from Jupiter and if they heard it back then they thought their radio was busted.</UTT>Only WW2. People knew Jupiter existed in the 1940s.</UTT>I wonder if they have the knowledge or technology to identify themselves without the radio signals from the Jupiter back then?</UTT>Oh, no, radio has been around for like 100 years.</UTT>1

Hello, who are you today?</UTT>I'm good, the sun shines here. What about you?</UTT>Same here after our big bomb cyclone in Colorado.</UTT>That's crazy, do you know the colors of the sunset on Mars?</UTT>Is it blue or something?</UTT>I heard it was blue, would like to see that.</UTT>I do too. You can believe that the sun is only a million times bigger than the biggest star in our galaxy.</UTT>That blows my mind. I wonder how scientists know or measure that information.</UTT>LOL you both, do you know much about cars?</UTT>A little bit. Ever been in a car driving you?</UTT>I have no. You haven't?</UTT>But I heard Google's car has aggressive mode.</UTT>No way. I bet that's for driving in a big city haha. They should put the flame throwers on them too.</UTT>That's crazy, do you know it's illegal to warm up your car in Ohio?</UTT>I don't know about that, I wonder why. You don't.</UTT>I guess there are too many thefts of keys that just sit in an empty car.</UTT>Well that makes sense. Have you heard why the Camaron is named in a way?</UTT>I haven't. Do you know?</UTT>It was named after the founder of Detroit, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac.</UTT>That's a good name. Do you know the arrow next to the pump symbol on your dash board?</UTT>Hahaha I know that and am so happy for me. Great chat. Have an awesome Friday.</UTT>1

How are you hi?</UTT>I did amazing today. Are you a big fan of comedy films?</UTT>I'm. Are you a fan of Demetri Martin?</UTT>He's hilarious and an awesome comedian like Bert Richter.</UTT>He actually dropped out of Harvard law to pursue comedy.</UTT>Is his comedy funny because he draws? Are you a fan of any other famous comedian?</UTT>Ryan Tiles is also pretty funny. What about you?</UTT>I love Joe Roy, Duncan Trussel and dudes like that.</UTT>Actually, the same here. Ryan Tiles also dropped out of school to pursue a career in comedy.</UTT>Are you a fan of Bill Murray's comedy?</UTT>I'm not too familiar with him. Are you?</UTT>Have you ever seen Ghostbusters or Zombieland? You probably know his face, but you don't recognize him by his name.</UTT>Definitely. Are you a drama fan?</UTT>I love big time dramas like godfather and his city.</UTT>That's good. I love that Jim Carey doesn't make any more drama with his belief system.</UTT>He is so diverse, one of our best comedians of our time, you think of all his movies, from The Mask to Bruce Almighty. Amazing.</UTT>That was a great movie. The actor, Hugh Laurie, was the highest paid TV drama. He had to be nice.</UTT>Have you ever seen Hugh Laurie in the House? He's amazing his accent is so good you can't figure out what actually Great Britain is when you see him.</UTT>I haven't. I can watch that later.</UTT>Give it a watch, go to youtube and look at the doctor's review in the house.</UTT>Okay, I did. Nice to chat to you.</UTT>Have a great day friend.</UTT>You as well.</UTT>1

Hey, how do you do and have ever used the internet for stuff other than turkin?</UTT>I look up stuff like "3 horizontal lines icon" all the time. It's called hamburger, it makes me hungry now.</UTT>It makes no sense to me too that the internet is contracting with an interconnect network.</UTT>I just learned that recently too. Do you know of the 3G cell service on top of Mt. Everest?</UTT>I don't know, because the satellites are closer?</UTT>Or order pizza delivered after the climb. When you buy something on the internet, you read the full term. Only 7% read it?</UTT>I never had that high of a number, I wonder who all of their readers are. Do it yourself.</UTT>Wow, I don't know, I don't know either, I just keep making Bezos rich, that's beyond question. I don't own IMDB, my Amazon owns it.</UTT>Bezos is so rich that he built a 10,000 year clock. I wonder how accurate it would be then if daylight hours were shifted. That's pretty crazy on IMDB.</UTT>I know. Trustbusters rescue. His poor workers walk 7-15 miles a day in one shift.</UTT>People who bust trusts like anti-monopoly people. I don't mind seeing them around for days now.</UTT>They've been lazy lately. Funny how the first customer on Amazon gets a building named after them. I'd rather have money.</UTT>I too, but getting the building name for you is a pretty good deal too. I feel bad for those warehouse workers because of the crappy pay and insurance until recently.</UTT>Even USPS had a deal with him to deliver Sunday. Sure they snubbed my little old.</UTT>Ali Baba Group sure isn't too far behind and have you ever ordered from them?</UTT>No, but I think I've seen their stuff. Do you like country music? I can take it in small doses.</UTT>It's not really a huge fan to be honest. I've never known George Strait and Bezos as cousins. That's crazy.</UTT>I like him. I think it's hilarious that Henry Ford helped bolster country music because he thought it was decadent. Something tells me he's not a fan of rape.</UTT>Haha, he's not. U2 is a huge fan of country music too. He used to open up playing country music on his own.</UTT>I don't know about that, I also don't know if the Fender Stratocaster was intended for country music. It is now a rock icon.</UTT>Haha that's pretty crazy and I wonder what that was like in the 70's country music.</UTT>Rocks can really get kicked in that. Thanks for the great chat.</UTT>I'll chat with you great too, have a great night's rest.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you?</UTT>I'm good. DC is not too great for tonight's forecast. Snow possible.</UTT>Yuck, we're dusting today and I'm pretty much done with winter, it can go away now, do you not like winter?</UTT>I'm not a big fan of snow. I'd like to see our forecast end up being somewhere between 50 and 60 years.</UTT>I'm in Chicago and would like 30C at this point. We had -30C a week or two ago.</UTT>I'm not a fan of polar vortex, Chicago should move to being close to the sun, a perfect sphere of hot plasma.</UTT>It's actually white too, I've never guessed it.</UTT>It is about 109 times larger on earth and about 330k heavier.</UTT>Yeah, but the lightning bolts are hotter than the sun's surface. That seems odd.</UTT>Wow, that's pretty crazy. Do you know the sunsets are blue on Mars? I wonder why.</UTT>I have no idea. I bet it looks pretty. Sure, it takes time for Pluto to go around the sun.</UTT>What does it take for Neptune to do? I'm not aware that the sun rotates as well.</UTT>It completed its first full orbit in 2011 since 1846.</UTT>Wow, that's pretty nuts, just as much as a radio station playing sun-made sounds.</UTT>It is the most important source of energy for life on earth. It deserves its own radio station.</UTT>It is no doubt important but Amazon seems almost as important to many of us. I bought everything from food to books to toys there.</UTT>You are their first customer?</UTT>No, but that's cool, I have the building named after me.</UTT>I drove it just to check in. I also brag about all my friends. They think it's obnoxious.</UTT>LOL I love Amazon's logo, they really have everything from a to z.</UTT>They do. Nice chat with you.</UTT>1

How did I say hi to you tonight? Are you a dog?</UTT>Yes, my dog is sleeping next to me now.</UTT>You are lucky I wish I had a dog, but I can't manage it at the moment.</UTT>Dog when you can get one from a shelter. Best dog ever. First domesticated animal.</UTT>Why shelters? People don't pick a certain breed of one with certain traits.</UTT>Save lives, although I feel my dogs saved me. Sure, they vary in size and shape.</UTT>Oh, okay, I guess you are right, did you take your dog to obedience school?</UTT>Nope, house training is already in place, great with kids, very polite, love, no issue, dogs can learn over 1000 words.</UTT>Yes, but how do they do it on the SAT? I know those dogs are pretty clever at figuring things out too.</UTT>The reward is very based.</UTT>I guess we are all to an extent. What do you think of Google then?</UTT>Google. I use it for dog, comedy, or fantasy research.</UTT>Google is a dog company they let employees bring dogs that's great, dogs in offices make for a friendly atmosphere.</UTT>Oh, I love that I bring the dog to work. They might have had a eureka moment to solve the problem for Google lol.</UTT>Yeah, they might be good to test. Is it iii and something wrong with server code? Lassie</UTT>I'm not surprised they are selectively bred to code.</UTT>That's right, Google has some special group to breed code dogs. LOL</UTT>They regard them highly in Russia. Unknown dog tomb.</UTT>I know that a dog in Moscow learned to ride the subway. I guess they know where to get food. LOL</UTT>Dogs have extra sense, which makes them useful in many other roles than companionship, even in the police and military.</UTT>Yeah, they have some color vision too, great chat anyway.</UTT>I want to end this. The other night at 2pm I went outside to put the trash out. My dog sensed something and started not growling. She never grewled, then from us a figure ran away.</UTT>Do. Good night.</UTT>Care.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you?</UTT>I'm good, just ready to watch some basketball today. Suggestions.</UTT>That's cool, I'm trying to catch some basketball games today. Who's your favorite player?</UTT>I'm in favor of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar all the time. He's so dominant he's got it banned from college basketball for over a decade.</UTT>I like him too. His use of dunks is epic and I can see why they are banned. My favorite player is Lebron James.</UTT>I like Lebron too, and I won't wait to see his Space Jam sequel.</UTT>I'm and my grandkid really likes the original Space Jam.</UTT>I really like it too. You know that physicists have proven the absolute best techniques to make NBA players throw free throws, but refuse to shoot because they look stupid to them.</UTT>I heard that and it looks stupid. If I got it, I would have done it, but if I did, I would have done it. LOL remember the first time the Air Jordans came out and the NBA banned them?</UTT>I did and he wore them anyway. Nike is willing to pay a fine for each game.</UTT>Sure, Nike has a lot of money to do that. They also gave 90 million to Lebron James after he turned down 1 million from Reebok a year ago because he said they could offer him more.</UTT>He is indeed. On Reebok, Allen Irving signed a lifetime deal in 2001 that paid him $800,000 a year until he reached 55.</UTT>Wow, he's also smart because if I wasn't mistaken, that deal would have paid him a final lump sum of $3 million.</UTT>That's right, if he's smart with his money he should be set. Tim Duncan is another smart player who has made a sacrifice of money and actually stayed in college for 4 years instead of going directly to the NBA.</UTT>That's very smart of him.</UTT>You know that the state employees are the highest of any college football or basketball coach in 39 US states. That's pretty wild.</UTT>Yes, do you know that the US Supreme Court has a top floor court known as the highest court on the land?</UTT>Wow, that's kinda neat. I wonder if they ever played any pickup game during the break?</UTT>Can you not see Ruth Baker Ginsburg in her granny style sneaker wearing shooting?</UTT>LOL, I paid to see that!</UTT>I too, she's a beast, hope she's mended after recent falls. (You know the New Zealand basketball team are nicknamed "black tall" (not to note that's the kind of racist)?</UTT>That's pretty racist. I don't think I want to wear any of their memorabilia. You know James Nismith, the basketball inventor who was the only coach in the history of the University of Kansas.</UTT>I'm not very racist either. I don't know how they'll get away with that in 2019. Anyway, I think James Naismith is a very ironic inventor because he should have rigged the basketball game to allow his team to win.</UTT>LOL, it brings new meaning to beating yourself in your game.</UTT>Haha that's so true, well, it's nice to chat to you this morning. I need to get to work and talk to you later, friend.</UTT>1

Hi Turker, you're a fan of the NFL do you think the Chief should be at the Superbowl?</UTT>The NFL or the National Football League, I didn't do a chief. Is that a team?</UTT>The Kansas City Chiefs are one of the top undefeated teams in the NFL in 2018.</UTT>Oh, and they aren't champions. I think not defeating them makes them the best?</UTT>I'm pretty sure the New England Patriots will beat them no matter which one disagrees with the referee's call.</UTT>Okay, I guess the referee made a controversial mistake that helped the Patriots. I guess it was.</UTT>Well, I just think I got your opinion, but what do you think of women in the NFL?</UTT>I don't think women are powerful enough to play in the NFL. Women usually have their own league.</UTT>That's my opinion, they should get a WNFL team and see how they work.</UTT>I don't know if there are different games and some rules can be changed, WNBA. I guess it might work.</UTT>That's true, but I think their ratings are low and not too many people talk about the Wnba.</UTT>True, I think the women's game tends to be slower and not as aggressive.</UTT>You're right, I'd like to see 3 points, a slam dump and other complicated shooting, just not regular shooting.</UTT>I expect women to want to join, but I don't think the game can be balanced for them.</UTT>If the NFL is co-ed, I don't want to see tackles.</UTT>I don't think I like it.</UTT>You are so right, do you believe average NFL game has 11 minutes of live play?</UTT>I think it's a short 11 minutes, but so many injuries. Very dangerous. That's why they get paid.</UTT>That's true, I still think it's over 11 minutes. Just having a nice meal at my table takes about 11 minutes, 11 minutes isn't any time at all.</UTT>True, I guess they're paid to stand around and wait. Great chat anyway.</UTT>Nice to chat to you and read more space.</UTT>1

Sean Hannity had an awkward moment and his quote from Braking Bad made him look really bad.</UTT>LOL Yeah right, but he doesn't think he's quoting "Break Bad"? I think they're comparing his quote to the scene in the show.</UTT>It sure is like a series, lol. He may not have done it in the intended way, but it is almost the same as the shady scene with Saul and the $10.</UTT>Yeah, of course. I wonder how Sean feels after he says it. I realize what he says.</UTT>I bet he feels pretty bad, he tried to justify himself but had already made a huge mistake, Cohen is a really shady lawyer, which we must face.</UTT>LOL, Hannety at least didn't go to lengths like whites and pinkmen did taking Saul out of the desert?</UTT>I agree, he sure does have time, but he still has.. so good series Breaking Bad.. I used to love Broadcast.</UTT>Sure many late nighters binge watching Breiten Bad. Just crazy how Sean thinks he will never retain Cohen.</UTT>LOL I think the critics are harsh on Sean but at the same time funy like the one that says dude needs to lay off the broadcast.</UTT>I think he sought advice from Cohen. Haha.</UTT>LOL, he should have changed his counsel well, all he said he would definitely do that!</UTT>Seriously, Donkey Kong is a uGH scandal.</UTT>I just heard about this scandal on the radio. Would you like to listen to the radio?</UTT>I listen to Sirius Radio. Do you listen to it?</UTT>You know, too, that Jupiter has hurricane storms that can be picked up by a minute radio on my way to work.</UTT>That's cool, I wonder how it sounds?</UTT>I guess it's interesting to listen to just about the other AM radios, but it gets boring after a while.</UTT>This is true, too funny 40% of Canadian music must be. Imagine that law in the US, people revolt.</UTT>Yeah people revolt less so I can understand it for sure, and lol, I think it is a great law to support local talent.</UTT>I totally agree, but you can never get away with it.</UTT>Yeah, I guess you're right, you should really look up this website, there are thousands of free drama episodes all on there.</UTT>1

Hello, do you know Kim Kardashian?</UTT>I realize those people, but I can tell you little else about them.</UTT>She used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant, apparently.</UTT>So she learned everything she knew about Paris. I'm a little vague about what she's doing right now.</UTT>I'm not sure as well. Her family has a show that keeps Kadashians up and she married Kyanye West. She can't really do anything.</UTT>Do you think they both went the route they did to get fame for the purpose?</UTT>Probably. I guess anything for fame. Really sickening how much family and success they have and how they don't seem to do anything. I've never seen their shows, I've never bought any of their products, and I don't want to contribute money to them.</UTT>You and I are on the same page here. The whole reality TV thing scrapes the bottom of the barrel. Have you heard of the Bad Girls Club?</UTT>I've never heard of it. Is there another reality show about rewards for bad behavior? LOL!</UTT>I really don't understand the point of the show other than showing that some women mean each other.</UTT>Sounds like I don't know why a show like that makes so much money. I understand that if the actors and fiction are like a show or movie, this producer is ridiculously encouraging these women to talk about themselves.</UTT>People just go over the top on this show to get screen time. They really don't act that way, but everyone has to outdo others and be more shocked. The better you are, the better.</UTT>I see producers like the documentary about it encouraging action on that.</UTT>I guess one of these people went too far and started committing crimes. The identity of a dead man was stolen.</UTT>Oh yes, I read about it recently.</UTT>I understand her acting as an escort, keeping guy's debit card and using it by her means after he dies.</UTT>Yeah, pretty scandalous, geez, I can't believe what some people do.</UTT>I think we should forget about these people. Here UNICEF donates clean water for a day instead. That feels better.</UTT>That is amazing, I hope to contribute to that, as I don't really use my phone that often. A positive story definitely.</UTT>I just wonder how they monitor it and suppose it must be in an honor system.</UTT>Hmmmm, not sure. Great chat though. Have a good one.</UTT>1

You like rap, I don't know much about the genre.</UTT>No, I don't like it. I think it's cool that rap originated in West Africa.</UTT>I'm not surprised that the genre has made its way from Africa to the US. And now it's moving from the US to around the world in every language.</UTT>Yes, it seems that it goes everywhere, even Tupac's music, made for the Liberal of Congress.</UTT>I heard that Pac danced ballet in high school. I expected him to be a dancer, but not that kind. The guy is really talented.</UTT>I really don't expect it either, but many singers (J Lo, for one) are multitalented and do movies. Steven Spielberg plays clarinet on jaws soundtrack. Figure.</UTT>The soundtrack to O Brother Where Art You? is multi-platinum in its speech.</UTT>Wow, I didn't know that. I saw that movie and it deserves some attention. Do you know of Bruce Lee, who also dances great?</UTT>Yeah, I heard he was good, he didn't win the contest in Hong Kong, didn't he? Good at dancing probably helped the martial arts, and vice versa.</UTT>He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958.</UTT>I wonder how old he is. I know that babies respond to music by dancing. It is instinctive and I can't dance at all.</UTT>And the baby smiles more when he hits the beat.</UTT>I guess classical music isn't so good for babies when they want to dance, have you heard of Daft Punk?</UTT>They sound vaguely familiar. What do they do with the soundtrack or movies?</UTT>They wear robot helmets. They do the Tron Legacy soundtrack.</UTT>I haven't seen Tron Legacy. Do you remember when Phil Collins did the Tarzan soundtrack?</UTT>I've never seen Tarzan. Is that an animated feature?</UTT>Yes, it was a Disney movie circa 1999, and it was very good. Do you know that soundtrack was recorded by Phil Collins in six different languages?</UTT>Wow, I guess he has a good ear for languages. Of course I should check out the English version of Tarzan.</UTT>If you are a Disney fan, it's funny. You say you see Michael Jackson doing extreme leaning in some dance moves. I wonder how he does it.</UTT>He copied it from someone else who used special shoes to lock onto the stage floor with bolt heads.</UTT>1

Hi, are you ariana GRANDDE fan?</UTT>I'm not, but I don't hate her. What about you?</UTT>I don't agree with her, but I feel somewhat negative after she accuses another singer of using bots to boost ratings.</UTT>I'm a 40 year old male and feel like I've lost all the modern music touches. I'm not proud of that, but it's reinforced every year when I watch the VMAs.</UTT>That's fair, Arianna definitely seems like a solid modern artist like you say, especially in a culture where she seems more important at the top of the chart than anything.</UTT>Who are your favorite artists?</UTT>My favorite artist is Kyanye West, ironically enough, who is also represented by Arianna's agent. What about you?</UTT>I recently got into jazz. I found a lot of religious artists that kept me happy.</UTT>That's fair. It certainly is an artistic form of music. Have you ever listened to rap?</UTT>I do it a while, I can't stop listening to Kendrick Lamar's latest when it comes out.</UTT>True, I think he is a very talented person, rap is a very historizated genre in general, do you know Tupac's music in the Liberal of Congress?</UTT>I don't know about that. I know that noclue can rape in English the fastest in the world at 14.1 a second.</UTT>That is certainly very impressive. I'm also interested in rap because of the controversy. Eminem is even being tried and judged by judges in the form of rap, for example.</UTT>Donald Glenn got his rapper name from a Wu-tang clan online generator as childish gambino. What is your name?</UTT>I'm not sure, but that's interesting. A lot of rapists are influenced by seemingly random sources. I know Eminem wanted a comic book artist before he raped.</UTT>Jason Page sings the theme of pokemon. Michael Jackson is also a rapper. That's so weird.</UTT>Amazing how many side ventures the artists have entered. Busta Rhymes also voiced the character in Rugrats, except for his rape.</UTT>I remember that. The deaf rapper "signmark" rhymes in sign language.</UTT>That's very interesting, I'm sure watching the show is fun. Do you often see movies?</UTT>I'm not really saying that to you.</UTT>I generally find myself interested in box office. I don't know Tom Hanks is the highest-rated box office star of all time.</UTT>Nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Hey there, have you ever ridden a horse in the past? I also saw Lipizzaner's show performing classical dressage.</UTT>I never had a chance to ride a horse. It looks fun. Lipizzaner?</UTT>You should try. It's a show horse performing very well. The Island horses have a fifth speed (called a fourth speed) but most have a fourth.</UTT>I don't know how fast each is. I guess each speed is for a different purpose.</UTT>Yeah exactly. Clint Eastwood rode a lot of horses in his movies but ended up allergic to them. That makes the ride tough.</UTT>I wonder how that happened. I guess the immune system is confused.</UTT>Yeah, it's odd how allergies can develop anytime. The dialect is associated with firefighters, apparently calming and protecting the horses back in the day.</UTT>I guess the noise and flames can make the horse nervous. The dog is probably calm and will help the horse become calm.</UTT>Yeah, good point. Do you use Google very often? A single search requires more compute power than sending Neil Armstrong to the moon.</UTT>I use google. I guess that power might be handy when I go to the moon next.</UTT>Hahaha I'd love to go to the moon too. At Google's headquarters they use live goats to trim their lawns.</UTT>Sign me up if the goat gets a stock option, I can eat the grass, I am not proud.</UTT>hahaha well, not sure you'll ever starve, do you have an android? Google maps calculates traffic using the speed of the mobile device's movement.</UTT>I don't like that Google tracks everything. Where I am and what I searched for.</UTT>They don't have the word "privacy" in their dictionary. They are powerful though. When border disputes arise, Google maps tailors maps to each country's claims.</UTT>I guess that would be helpful in the border dispute. I'd like them to think of the little guy and the individual.</UTT>Yeah, I too. They just seem to care about making money. Do you like dancing? Bruce Lee was apparently a great dancer and champion of the dance in 1958.</UTT>I bet he is. The body is extremely controlled and I guess he also senses rhythm. The lady is really a man.</UTT>Yeah, all ladies love him, no doubt. I always wonder how Michael Jackson could have done that lean move. He apparently has a patent for the device that allows him to do it. Michael Jackson died.</UTT>That shoe is really cool. He knows how to pull off an illusion.</UTT>That's for sure, Tupac was also a ballet dancer in high school, I never guess, he didn't rape about it.</UTT>He probably doesn't want that fact to get out. Anyway, I enjoyed the chat.</UTT>You as well, even babies can dance (lol) Have a good day!</UTT>1

A single search requires more compute power than sending Neil Armstrong to the moon.</UTT>I use google. I guess that power might be handy when I go to the moon next.</UTT>Hahaha I'd love to go to the moon too. At Google's headquarters they use live goats to trim their lawns.</UTT>If the goat gets a stock option, sign up for me.</UTT>hahaha well, not sure you'll ever starve, do you have an android? Google maps calculates traffic using the speed of the mobile device's movement.</UTT>I don't like that Google tracks everything. Where I am and what I searched for.</UTT>They don't have the word "privacy" in their dictionary. But they are powerful.</UTT>I guess horses are handy in border disputes. I'd like them to think of flames as well, and probably both.</UTT>Yeah, I too. They just seem to care about making money. Do you like dancing? Bruce Lee was apparently a great dancer and champion of the dance in 1958.</UTT>I bet he is. The body is extremely controlled and I guess he also senses rhythm. The lady is really a man.</UTT>Yeah, all ladies love him, no doubt. I always wonder how Michael Jackson could have done that lean move. He apparently has a patent for the device that allows him to do it. Michael Jackson died.</UTT>That shoe is really cool.</UTT>That's for sure. Each high school high school dancer was Pac.</UTT>He probably doesn't want that fact to get out. Anyway, I enjoyed the chat.</UTT>You as well, even babies can dance (lol) Have a good day!</UTT>0
Like horror films? I guess Stephen King considered "Bambi" a horror movie. I never guess.</UTT>Hey there really, I wonder why he ever said that!</UTT>Have you seen it? It's sad, but not for me, but for me, horror movies are sadder. Hahahaha.</UTT>I think I have, but I'm really young. Do you know how they make the majority of metallic noises in horror movies?</UTT>Haha, I didn't do it, some kind of weird instrument.</UTT>I guess it's called a waterphone, sounds like a pretty crazy instrument to me.</UTT>I need to look up what that sounds like, apparently you also have to watch more horror movies. Watching one can burn almost 200 calories, which helps me lose weight.</UTT>I guess they have to get your heart racing pretty fast. What are some of your favorite horrors?</UTT>I like The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween is a classic. What about you?</UTT>Yeah, good call, The Shining was one of the best ever, Halloween was good too, Nightmare, I really like Rosemary's Baby, did you see that one?</UTT>I haven't. I heard it, but haven't seen it yet.</UTT>It's really good because the husband set up the wife and basically gave birth to the devil.</UTT>Oh well, you like shinning, wow, good to know that Danny from the movie wasn't aware at the time that he was making a horror movie that could scare him for life.</UTT>I think that's pretty funny though, I wonder what kind of movie he thinks he got.</UTT>Haha, I wonder if they shot the scene out of the blue or told him to lie to keep it so he doesn't know what he's diong about?</UTT>I think you might be right about that. Do you use Amazon on a different note?</UTT>I like to buy stuff there, I don't have a prime anymore because I don't use it enough. What about you?</UTT>I use them quite often, especially around holidays. Do you know which is the first time Amazon has ever purchased?</UTT>I didn't. I know a guy who bought the first item got the building he named. What is it?</UTT>Yeah, good call. I guess he paid $27.95 and got the building he named.</UTT>Hahahaha I mean it's cool to get the building named after you but it's more cool to get something physical instead of that.</UTT>1

Would you like to read?</UTT>I love reading. Do you like reading?</UTT>I would do when I had a chance. Unfortunately, it wasn't until the 18th century, when there was fear that reading novels would spread. It was a moral panic.</UTT>That's scary, isn't it? I'm glad modern times are upon me. I know it's going to be hard for me to get some free time to relax and read.</UTT>Yeah, it is, but if I could read at a speed like Anne Jones who reads 4700 words per minute, I might have more time to read.</UTT>I know that isn't real, how can you understand what you're reading at that speed?</UTT>I know, I wonder how they verified she actually read. Can comprehension be a question?</UTT>There are a lot of them. Have you read the book about Enders game? I think the movie is, but I haven't seen it. It's on the military read list.</UTT>I haven't read that. Some military branches also list readings for starship troopers.</UTT>That looks like a good read. I wonder why Thomas Jefferson created his version of the Bible.</UTT>I'm not sure. I wonder how he thinks kids learn Bibles in school.</UTT>I don't know. Only President Teddie Roosevelt and John Adams that don't use the Bible for swearing ins. I think they use the Constitution instead.</UTT>Interesting. I wonder about Jefferson because it wasn't uncommon for students to be required to read the Bible as part of their elementary education before 1963.</UTT>That's interesting. The apple is called malus in Latin.</UTT>I guess it means both apples and evil.</UTT>I don't know about that. Good to know there are 3 gigabit cell services on the top of Mt Everest.</UTT>Ha, I guess it's difficult to escape technology. If the internet burns, there's also a copy of it.</UTT>That's a good idea. I believe it's true that only 7% of people read full terms when they buy products.</UTT>Wow, I think they are ii.</UTT>I'm too, they make it so long to read. Who knows what's there. It's scary to know that the menu buttons are also called hamburger buttons?</UTT>I've never heard that called it.</UTT>1

Hi,</UTT>Hello.</UTT>How is it day?</UTT>I'm annoyed that UPS has been waiting to deliver my box and keeping rescheduling so far. What box are you in?</UTT>Fine.</UTT>We're talking about any subject?</UTT>Talk to the telephone.</UTT>I didn't get it. Dial 212 fastest (111)?</UTT>It's possible and easiest to dial.</UTT>So the cable that carried phones and internet data across the ocean was only 2.7 meters in diameter and was just lying on the ocean floor. If some big ass fish bit through them, what happened?</UTT>Nothing like they use protection measures to prevent fish from harming the cable.</UTT>And they keep agents on the ocean floor as well?</UTT>That as well.</UTT>Do you know that the iphone has more compute power than the entire United States nuclear ICBM deterrent?</UTT>iii) It's new technology added to the advantages of the iphone.</UTT>Do you own an iphone?</UTT>I own an iPhone.</UTT>Personally I prefer Android. I like Huawei phones.</UTT>That's a popular choice, using Android instead of the iPhone.</UTT>Why don't you have an Android phone?</UTT>After this Christmas Eve I'll have to own an Android phone.</UTT>Great talk, ii.</UTT>1

I always enjoy reading people's ideas about dream days, sometimes it gives me ideas of what to do.</UTT>That's an interesting article and there are so many things to do in the D.C. area.</UTT>Yeah, most of it doesn't sound fun to me, but the idea of a menu sounds amazing.</UTT>I agree you were in the D.C. area before. I would like to go to the Natural History Museum because it seems like a great place.</UTT>I've never been. I've never been east of the Mississippi. Are you in DC?</UTT>I'm in D.C. I think it's a great place, what would you like to do there?</UTT>Check out all the standard tourist stuff probably just. I'd like to see the Library of Congress but I'd wind up living on the street there to have continued access. What do you do?</UTT>LOL, that doesn't sound like a fun activity. I'd like to try one of those sweet and caffeinated drinks.</UTT>I'm not sure what she's talking about, I've never tried Storbo tea, it sounds like two drinks were ordered and mixed together. Seafood also sounds amazing, especially calamari.</UTT>That dish sounds great, I'd like to try it out as well. The cuisine in the area must be one of the best in the whole country.</UTT>They probably said DC used to be a backwater compared to New York, but it's probably a lot better because it expanded so much after WWII.</UTT>So it's a lot better by now, so do you like fantasy?</UTT>Not really, I like the usual child fantasy lit (popular with adult stoners like Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Graham) but I like some, but sci-fi the most.</UTT>I do. I like fantasy movies and games also. A Chicago janitor wrote a 15000-page fantasy manuscript.</UTT>I wonder if it's any good.</UTT>I bet a few pages is too bad it was discovered after he died.</UTT>I should google it to find out more about it. Nice to have it published.</UTT>It might be. Who knows if his masterpiece could inspire a movie. A lot of pages.</UTT>Yeah, that's not a novel, it's a series as a whole.</UTT>I agree with the whole series, he must have invested a lot of time into it.</UTT>His secret life must be away from work. Nice chat.</UTT>1

Hello.</UTT>Hi there!</UTT>You know the BBC decided on January 18, 1930 that their report was not worth the news so they broadcast piano music instead.</UTT>Wow, really. I wonder how many people then have TV.</UTT>Good question. Freddie Mercury used the same piano as Paul McCartney used to record hey jude as he recorded bohemian rhapsody.</UTT>Cool, have you ever heard of Eurovision?</UTT>What is that?</UTT>The Song Contest takes place in England.</UTT>Oh, okay, in 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano.</UTT>neat, appears to be away from competitors usually relying on over the top spectacle.</UTT>The handenburg lounge was built with an aluminum grand piano. It weighs only 356 pounds.</UTT>Wow, I don't know that. Portugal's RTP stripe the Eurovision stage of the wall of the LED screen that has become an ubiquitous backdrop in recent years.</UTT>Eddie van Halen literally set studio speakers on fire while recording a guitar solo for beat-it music.</UTT>My gosh, do you like jazz?</UTT>No really, you?</UTT>Some are, but jazz is a musical genre that originated in the African-American community of New Orleans.</UTT>Program language where programs are written in music composition and function programs have jazz harmonies.</UTT>I have no idea. Jazz is rooted in the expression of culture and music in West Africa.</UTT>A woman in Harlem holds a free jazz concert in her apartment every Sunday for 20 years. Top performers stop by occasionally.</UTT>That's neat. In the early 1910s, New Orleans jazz began by combining brass bands marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime, and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.</UTT>Pakistan has a jazz orchestra currently at the top of the chart.</UTT>Clint Eastwood has been a jazz enthusiast all his life, a pianist, and a scorer for several films, including the $1 million baby.</UTT>The Clint Eastwood movie was awesome.</UTT>They are, I especially like Torino, what's your favorite?</UTT>That's great, no forgiveness is awesome.</UTT>I have to look up that one. Jazz trumpeters grow goatees because they provide comfort when playing.</UTT>I didn't realize that. That was very interesting. Thanks for the chat.</UTT>You too. Have a good day.</UTT>Thanks and have a great day as well.</UTT>Matthew Bellamy of the Muse holds the world Guinness record for most guitars smashed on tour.</UTT>1

Do you like Jon Hamm?</UTT>He's so funny, he used to teach drama in high school once.</UTT>And Ellie Keper was one of his students.</UTT>Yeah, small world, do you use YouTube?</UTT>Yes all the time. It's the second largest search engine anyway.</UTT>Yeah, do you know which videos there are the most disliked?</UTT>It's crazy with the baby from Justin Bieber.</UTT>I know.

What do you think of the tweets posted by the Russian Embassy?</UTT>It's kinda fun. Space ship emojis and some photos. Not serious at all. Twitter isn't meant to be serious.</UTT>Yeah, I guess Twitter is informal, but there are still serious repercussions.</UTT>There are a lot of reasons why the helicopter is around DC. DC police have them for possible robberies. I guess it's possible that the real event is taken the wrong way. It's serious.</UTT>It seems to me that it is a bit too unrealistic, like Tom Clancy's novel.</UTT>Like a novel. You know the Russian Foreign Ministry put a fools joke in April into the answering machine. Press 3 to request interference in elections. That's a good one.</UTT>It doesn't sound like the Russian Foreign Ministry is full of surprises.</UTT>Oh, the Russians have always had fun. Not like the US where Hank's cat ran for the Virginia Senate election. He got a third.</UTT>I'm too bad for Hank to cheer for, and he's probably doing a better job than most politicians.</UTT>Cool cat. Odd how we pick elected officials. The faster blinkers have apparently lost the election of a president every since 1980.</UTT>I bet that's a subconcious signal we'll pick up. You know the Iphone has more compute power than all the nuclear deterrents combined.</UTT>I wonder how that could happen. A missile hit a moving target is not a small feat let alone a few hundred targets. I believe in phones. There is little correlation between the quality of cellphone calls and the service bar.</UTT>I know I think it requires something a lot more powerful than the iphone, and I wonder why.</UTT>I don't know, that rule can say that compute power doubles and costs are half the cost very year. I have a fun piece of trivia about the phone, dialing is created because businesses think operators are routing calls to them in a competitive manner.</UTT>What an interesting one, I have one for you too. You know why New York's 212 area code is.</UTT>I guess the numbers 313 and 414) were early ideas. NY was the first state to have the number 212. The actress helped invent cell phone wifi and GPS in the 1930s. The way that Howard Lamarr went.</UTT>No, it's the fastest dial back number on a rotary phone, so the answer is correct.</UTT>Well that sounds reasonable. No idea why or how such a thing would happen. Kinda like a hedy bit of trivia.</UTT>Yeah, I guess it's because of life's coincidences, like the guest houses of the current president might kind of be bigger than the White House.</UTT>The White House has some thick walls ha ha - First President Lincoln took a photo for the inauguration - do you want to know the freaky part?</UTT>Please tell me ii.</UTT>John Wilkes Boot in Lincoln photo.

Do you enjoy watching films or TV?</UTT>I love to watch films, but not so much TV.</UTT>What genre do you enjoy? I like horror films.</UTT>I don't like horror films, I actually watched live on Saturday. I love the skit, but miss the old school cast.</UTT>Horror films are usually hit or miss for me, unlike most genres. I feel horror is very subjective.</UTT>I understand what you mean by horror films. I feel intellectually that Momento was intended for horror, but turned out not so much. I agree that they were hit or missed.</UTT>In some films do you know that actors don't know how to perform in horror movies?</UTT>I read that, but I didn't know before I read that. I also read that some movies are scary but end up being horror. It seems crazy.</UTT>I mean, if you don't gloss over that it is a Disney film, I can see why Stephen King terrifies Babies, it is quite dark.</UTT>A lot of Disney movies are scary and dark. A wicked stepmother who locked Cinderella up in the tower.</UTT>Well, a lot of them are toned down versions of their German counterparts.</UTT>Interesting, I don't know that. Where did you learn that information?</UTT>I learned it in high school. For example, one girl cut her heel and other girls' toes to fit because her stepister's feet were too big to fit a glass slipper.</UTT>Wow, that feels like a horror movie to me. Dark and depressing, thank you for telling me that, I think I'll stick with my romcom.</UTT>Well, it's a bit dark, but I think it's interesting to learn about all the Disney classics' origins.</UTT>I agree, I just have no idea what would come of that. I feel that could be categorised as a horror movie that wasn't originally supposed to be considered.</UTT>True, as I said, most of what we consider to be horror movies is highly subjective.</UTT>As of late, you have seen any other horror movie. I feel like there are some crazy horror movies, some of which include kidnappings or murders. Recently I saw an ad for a nice woman who then tortured people. I think it's gonna be named Greta.</UTT>I saw the elevator. The old horror movies were so bad they were known as better and more hilarious.</UTT>I tried to steer clear of horror movies altogether. I remember watching Halloween in high school and practically throwing up, and that movie was so ridiculous. So, I watch fluffy or dramatic movies, it's nice to talk to you.</UTT>Same for you.</UTT>1
Do you enjoy watching films or TV?</UTT>I love to watch films, but not so much TV.</UTT>What genre do you enjoy? I like horror films.</UTT>I don't like horror films, I actually watched live on Saturday. I love the skit, but miss the old school cast.</UTT>Horror films are usually hit or miss for me, unlike most genres. I feel horror is very subjective.</UTT>I understand what you mean by horror films. I feel intellectually that Momento was intended for horror, but turned out not so much. I agree that they were hit or missed.</UTT>In some films do you know that actors don't know how to perform in horror movies?</UTT>I read that, but I didn't know before I read that.

Hey, do you think Kobe Bryant will play in the Big 3 next year?</UTT>I heard I could imagine that, but I can't.</UTT>He's got pretty old, honestly I think he should just give it all up. What do you think? You've also ever watched the NBA.</UTT>You are probably right. I watch occasionally.</UTT>I'm interested in only one Canadian NBA team so I wonder what happened.</UTT>I don't realize that there is one. I guess I don't think it's the National Basketball Association. If it's north of Canada, the games travel a lot.</UTT>That's true, but if they demand a team they should put the team up somewhere, which is interesting about the NBA being located in New York, I've never known them.</UTT>I don't either. Are you familiar with Reggie Miller?</UTT>I heard them. His sister isn't really good at basketball too, she constantly beats his set records?</UTT>She overshadowed him in high school. She broke the nation's 8-records.</UTT>Amazing, what do you think of Allen Irving, who makes almost $800,000 a year for Reebok alone?</UTT>I heard that. He only ages 55 and then gets a lump sum of $32 billion.</UTT>Yep, he's not a money problem, btw, what do you think of shooting granny style? lol, if you want to pay me $32 million, I'd definitely shoot it all night.</UTT>I actually hear the most effective way to score points on the line. No matter how effective the method looks, I use the most effective method.</UTT>Yep, too, did you ever wear Air Jordans before? The NBA apparently initially banned them.</UTT>I have no. I know Jordan is wearing them anyway and Nike is paying a fine for it. It seems to work out for them.</UTT>Yeah, I think that was the right move. I don't think Tim Duncan was the right move to delay his NBA play because he stayed in college to get his degree which cost him money.</UTT>But thankfully he still gets to play later so he gets his education and NBA career.</UTT>That's one way to look at it, by the way, how many times do you use the internet? You don't know what the hamburger button is.</UTT>I use the internet constantly but never hear of a hamburger button. What is it?</UTT>It's a button that looks like three horizontal lines. It's normally used in menus. I think Reddit actually uses it.</UTT>1

Hello, do you know much about cinematography?</UTT>Not really, I'm an avid movie watcher, I've heard of Roger Deakins constantly being nominated for the award.</UTT>Ok, I haven't heard of him, that's great because he was nominated at the time.</UTT>Would you like to visit D.C. They have over 250 restaurants and a summer restaurant week?</UTT>I've never been there. I read that recently. Do you know that women aren't being nominated for the Oscars for best cinematography when they are?</UTT>That's probably going to change soon. I don't know if Stanley Kubrick is involved in Spartacus.</UTT>I'm either. Do you like comedy?</UTT>Yes, I can't believe the Green Lantern with Jack Black was a comedy.</UTT>That's weird, I'm not sure it makes it better lol</UTT>Can't hurt much. I'm surprised to know that Python is in part named for Monty Python.</UTT>Yeah, that might be a coincidence. I guess Comedian Central didn't do great because they canceled the show over.</UTT>That or they are picky. Bill Murray isn't so picky. He thinks Kung-Fu Hustle is super great.</UTT>It was a great movie.</UTT>I'm an amatuer astonomer and I'm fascinated by Jupiter's Ganymede moon, it's big enough to be a planet.</UTT>That's really big.</UTT>Uranus is another actual rotational planet on its side. Many people think Uranus is involved in a major collision.</UTT>Oh, that's interesting, and it was thrown off axis by accident. Does it rotate to its side, in an area that doesn't get the sun?</UTT>Yeah, sunlight is a weird time pattern at the poles. I guess life-building blocks like RNA are detected in planet systems 455 light years away.</UTT>Do you know that the planet was where glass shards sideways rained in 2000?</UTT>I guess Pluto is probably one of the outer ice planets. Venus doesn't have a season or that kind of wind.</UTT>Interesting, thank you.</UTT>Thanks, you're a great chat partner.</UTT>1

Play any model of the Playstation?</UTT>I used to play on the original playstation. What about you?</UTT>I play with them all, enjoy them all. I currently use the PS3 to research black holes, wonder how it works.</UTT>I'm not sure. Do you play often?</UTT>I do between my PS2 and XBox, do you play PS2 at all?</UTT>I think I have that one. I didn't play much, I didn't even play a lot in college. I played a ton when I got my first job and moved with my gaming friends, we were all at the time leaving the bar early for them.</UTT>It was very fun. The last game for PS2 was Football 14. It became the first game of the three console generations.</UTT>Wow, I have no idea. That seems like a good game to do. FA is crazy popular.</UTT>It's definitely, the Department of Defense also used 1760 playstations to build supercomputers. They found all kinds of console use.</UTT>That's crazy PS2 is the most sold game to date that just seems right.</UTT>I believe that because it has a digital player that it has a regular dc player. The first dvd player I know of is because the price isn't much different at the time from what a regular dvd plays.</UTT>One of my roommates bought a PS4 because he also played blue ray and wanted it new. He also played that all the time.</UTT>Makes sense, we use our media a lot, also watch a lot of TV, I watch way too much of it.</UTT>I'm trying to cut out unnecessary TV from my life. I still watch it, but I choose what's more valuable. What show do you watch?</UTT>A lot. Current binge on The Punisher. You know that there was only one episode of The Simpsons where Bart didn't appear and was not mentioned.</UTT>I do. Good episode 4 women and a manicure. I heard they were canceling The Punisher on Netflix.</UTT>I haven't heard that yet but it's positive that they've been slow to cancel all Marvel shows since Disney's merger. Another Simpsons fact is that when their Family Guy episode airs on their Family Guy facility they send flowers to the South Park crew.</UTT>Wow, have you watched a family guy or South Park? Enjoy the cartoons?</UTT>I watched both. But they were spot on in their criticism of Family Guy.</UTT>I didn't watch that one. Who's being criticized?</UTT>The How Family Guy's joke is basically a flashback series and he ripped off The Simpsons for its format.</UTT>Oh nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Hello, how do you do it? Soccer makes more money than combined football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey.</UTT>Hello, I do great, have you ever watched a variation where there are 3 teams instead of 2?</UTT>Nope, you know Jon Stewart, a skilled soccer player in college, and he represented the United States in the 1983 pan-American maccabi game in Brazil.</UTT>I don't follow soccer, and I remember reading about German players who donated their bonuses so that 23 kids could have surgery.</UTT>Wow, how generous. That's amazing. Americans call it soccer because it's slang for association football.</UTT>I find it fascinating that they used to dry tennis couts by helicopter at the US Open, 69 ft. I would love to see them.</UTT>LOL, seems like a huge expense.</UTT>I don't know about Canadian rapist Drake, do I?</UTT>Yes, on a tour in the UK in 2011, Drake spent an obscenity amount of money on the first edition of Charlotte's Web, a children's classic book, such as Winnie the Poh.</UTT>That's sweet and interesting that he chose to graduate at the age of 25 instead of his education diploma.</UTT>Yeah, he might really like his friends in high school still.</UTT>Kyanye is so sensitive that after hearing Eminiem's verse, I can't believe she actually cancelled her appointment to rewrite parts of her song with Drake.</UTT>Yeah, he is definitely sensitive.</UTT>Have you watched Degrassi? He was an actor there and I have never heard of it.</UTT>I heard it, never watched it, is that Disney?</UTT>I'm not sure, I've never watched it, but it's been on for 7 years.</UTT>Rapist Drake visited Drake University in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get a visit when the tour stopped.</UTT>That's funny, I bet he'll make their night. I'm surprised to hear he signed the Lil Wayne label instead of the Dead Row of Drew.</UTT>That's very interesting, but either way he still makes a lot of money.</UTT>And I think he's also in favor of one dance, one of the most popular.</UTT>I too. That song is great. Good talk to you.</UTT>1

Good Morning. Do you follow the president's history?</UTT>I don't know much, but I find myself very interested, especially with the crazy way elections used to work. Did you know that the US president was appointed as a vice president until the early 1800s?</UTT>Now imagine that. JFK, Washington and Jefferson were the top three richest Americans before Trump.</UTT>I wonder what the specific numbers are on that or how they compare to inflation (the US president back in the day was usually a business man, meanwhile Indonesian president released a pop album haha).</UTT>I think you're pretty correct, most of the businessmen or ex-military generals. Makes you wonder what he would do in office if the president of Indonesia had that much free time at hand. I like Zimbabwe's first president's name.</UTT>I wonder how President Banana got his nickname. Do you think his name sounds banana or he really loves eating them?</UTT>I think it probably sounds like it. Do you know that the guest house of the US president is larger than the white house?</UTT>I'm so shocked by that. I expected all the extra security of the White House and bigger staff. Smaller buildings could be more secure?</UTT>That may be right, I wonder if it might just be for the comfort of more comfortable guest visiting the White House.</UTT>Do you think white house guests could use a more luxurious stay in a palace or something enormous?</UTT>I'm sure they'll probably be treated top notch. They won't stay at the motel 6 lol.</UTT>I wonder if they have any special fun stuff to accommodate guests like a recording studio for an Indonesian President?</UTT>That's funny, isn't it? Candy desks have been a tradition of the US Senate since 1968. PA-made candy currently supplies them.</UTT>I've never even heard of this. A lifesize desk made of candy or a desk covered with candy?</UTT>It was a candy desk where drawers were full of candy. I don't think they were as relevant as they used to be. My elementary school secretary had one when I was a kid.</UTT>Is that interesting for children's visits or staff visits? I don't quite imagine the children's tours going through the White House these days, as the current president doesn't live there.</UTT>I think they have it there for a show and more historical purposes. I seem to remember in the early 1980s when candy desks were going away at school, when the generation that liked them started to retire.</UTT>Seems the whole world has changed drastically since the late 1980s. Did you know women were not allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993?</UTT>Yes, it doesn't seem much has changed except the job economy has slid downhill since then. I don't know that. What an odd law.</UTT>Another weird Senate law where an arms sergeant can arrest an absent senator and make him come to the chamber for a vote. The guy tried to escape and they dragged him off the foot. I hope it's worth running for.</UTT>LOL, that's definitely a strange law. I wonder how they came up with that.</UTT>Hahaha I guess low productivity runs and somebody gets a bright and aggressive idea.</UTT>That's funny, I'm having fun chatting with you, hope you have an enjoyable day.</UTT>1

Hi, do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Hello, I actually did. Do you know Bill Murray is the voice of the human torch on 4 fantastic radio shows?</UTT>Cool doesn't know you can catch the Jupiter storm if you turn on the radio.</UTT>Nice, would like to hear that. Radio stations can translate the sun's activity into sound.</UTT>Wow cool, do you know what a foxhole is?</UTT>Hmmmm, I'm not sure Foxhole radio is something of the past, is it?</UTT>They were. They were radios made by soldiers using razorblades and pencils during WW2.</UTT>I wonder how that actually works. The Jackson song once became the most popular because the DJ didn't reveal the band.</UTT>They are very creative with that. Have you ever listened to Canadian radio?</UTT>Not a lot, sometimes. You suggest.</UTT>I only do what happens. Do you know that they require 40% of Canadian music to be played?</UTT>Wow, they really have to want to support their local singers. They'd be good to have some nice up and coming singers too.</UTT>That's true, have you ever listened to radio drama?</UTT>I can't say I did actually. Did you know that one of the most popular radio acts of the 1970s was a ventriloquist?</UTT>Wow, I don't know that. If you ever wanted a free channel to broadcast them, you would have a channel that broadcasts them.</UTT>That's nice, added to that, that's free. Do you know much about the President?</UTT>Hmmmm, I know some stuff like not allowing close family members to run in Guatemala too.</UTT>That's interesting. Wilson is the only US president with a doctorate.</UTT>Yeah, I guess you don't need one after all. Do you know that the President is the wealthiest person in our history?</UTT>I don't think I actually know that. I know Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inaugural.</UTT>That's neat. Jefferson, JFK and Washington are the wealthiest of the three.</UTT>1

Do you know much about the President?</UTT>Hmmmm, I know some stuff like not allowing close family members to run in Guatemala too.</UTT>That's interesting.</UTT>Yeah, I guess you don't need one after all. Do you know that the President is the wealthiest person in our history?</UTT>I don't think I actually know that. I know Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inaugural.</UTT>That's neat, Jefferson, JFK and Washington are the wealthiest of the three, yeah I don't guess you need one after all. Do you know the president is the wealthiest person in our history?</UTT>0
Have you watched baseball?</UTT>Hi, I love baseball, in fact, I also love soccer and baseball (they call it "Iii" in Canada) - who are you? Ha!</UTT>LOL I never knew that. I like watching baseball. Do you have a favorite team?</UTT>I really like them all. You know baseball managers only wear uniforms because they can play on their teams if needed. I would love to see old managers get out there and play. Ha!</UTT>That's awesome, I've seen it before on the semi pro team I played on. The coach is 50 and we have too many hurt people lol.</UTT>I bet that's the sight to see, isn't it? It's almost fascinating to find a $300k baseball card in your grandfather's attic, like that one guy did. So it's nice.</UTT>Right, talk about early retirement, collect a card?</UTT>I should start or at least check some attic, you can believe it's a baseball surprise for a Japanese fan to learn baseball is America's national pastime. I'm surprised by the fact that it does. Ha!</UTT>LOL Right, I used to collect and have some good ones worth PS300m. I'm too surprised they've started the game since America invented it.</UTT>I know, don't you think they know that? I didn't know that married couples had all the games played for 24 years until 2005 again until recently, so that's a cool job.</UTT>I wonder how they got that job and why they shy away from it. That's so fun.</UTT>Yes it does. You can imagine the schedule of teams like the Cubs. That's so cool. It's shocking they haven't won a World Series since they became the first team to win back to back in baseball.</UTT>They won it a few years ago but it took more than 100 years to do it. Have you watched a world series this year?</UTT>I can't, sad, I guess, which is part of the reason why the women's World Cup has a higher TV rating in the US than the world series.</UTT>LOL I too have been following it mostly online. Have you heard that Ruth lost the world series in 1926?</UTT>I actually did. I heard he was caught stealing at the end of game 7 and his team was down only one run. It must have been so disappointing.</UTT>I'm sure that's after they've already won a bunch of world series, so they're probably going to show it off (lol).</UTT>Ha, maybe so. But you can believe that the Marine Corps carried the Canadian flag upside down into the stadium during the 1992 World Series. That's embarrassing.</UTT>LOL, that's so embarrassing. Canada is too nice to chat with.</UTT>Yes Canada is very nice, personally I think if over 80 percent of the natural forests were not destroyed, that would be so heartbreaking, well, it would be nice to chat as well, friend, I hope you have a great day.</UTT>You too. Enjoy your weekend.</UTT>1

But back to back, until 2005, I didn't know that the marriage shy away would also surprise 2430 enjoyable games (so that must be a series that gets).</UTT>I wonder how they got that job and why they shy away from it.</UTT>Yes it does.

Hello there, have you watched much TV?</UTT>Television is the biggest entertainment medium for news, advertising and fun. It is famous for transporting moving images.</UTT>That's true, I've watched quite a bit, have you ever seen pokemon?</UTT>Yes, TV has improved well after the second world war to black and white. It is the primary medium to influence public opinion.</UTT>Have you ever watched TV in black and white only?</UTT>The early bulky heavy cathrode ray tubes were replaced by flat compacts.</UTT>Sure it is. I still can remember the first color television in my friend's house as well.</UTT>It is very interesting. Television uses high-power radio frequency transmitters to broadcast individual television signals as antenna receivers.</UTT>That is very interesting to learn about the origins of television.</UTT>Today, with technological advances, we use LED televisions all the time.</UTT>That's true, they just get bigger and bigger every year as well.</UTT>Yes, would you like a live concert?</UTT>As you suggest, I enjoy going to live concerts, but not as often as I would like.</UTT>I like jazz concerts that originate in African American communities in New Orleans. Jazz has spread around the world to classical American music.</UTT>Jazz listening can be really fun, I don't know that is very interesting.</UTT>Cool Jazz developed at the end of the 1940s, making pleasant smooth sounds for pleasant people, the next step of jazz music.</UTT>That's true. Do you know why jazz trumpeters start growing goatees?</UTT>It is very interesting that it was originally from before the 18th century.</UTT>Wow, that's very interesting. I know Clint Eastwood has been a jazz fan for a lifetime.</UTT>It is classical American music. It is the very similar one most of the time. It is very much for teenagers.</UTT>That's also true, well, nice to talk to you today and I hope you have a good day.</UTT>1

Hi, have you watched association football?</UTT>I watch it sometimes. Do you know why it's called soccer here?</UTT>It's actually just slang that sticks around.</UTT>Yeah, it's a sport that makes more than some others combined.</UTT>Yeah there's a lot of money in there. Do you know that Mesut Ozil donated one victory year from the World Cup?</UTT>And he helped 23 children with all that money. What a real guy.</UTT>Exactly Jon Stewart also plays soccer and represents the US in the pan American game in Brazil.</UTT>He's pretty much everywhere. Do you know three-team soccer?</UTT>I've heard of such variations, but haven't seen them yet, so they must be interesting.</UTT>I think so too. Do you know what Wikileaks is?</UTT>That's a website that displays all the government secrets.</UTT>And they have once published documents showing how the government plans to destroy them.</UTT>Wow, amazing. You know that 86 percent of the land in Nevada is owned by the government.</UTT>I wonder what they would do with all that land, but it's all desert.</UTT>True, good point. The French men twice managed to sell the Eiffel tower.</UTT>So he's really good at impersonating government officials.</UTT>That seems to be the way. The Norwegian government has donated 1 billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest.</UTT>That's impressive, do you use Google or another search engine?</UTT>I actually use google. Do you know how they calculate traffic?</UTT>Yeah, they take the average of Android devices as they move through traffic.</UTT>Yeah, pretty neat.</UTT>1

The French men twice managed to sell the Eiffel tower.</UTT>So it's really good monetary quantity to infer that all government officials are good officials.</UTT>That seems to be the way.

Do you like Republicans?</UTT>I have a few friends who say I'm a Republican. I'm an independent.</UTT>Cool, and I'm independent too!</UTT>The Republican Party used to be very different.</UTT>The GOP and the Grand Old Party.</UTT>Lincoln is a Republican.</UTT>Do you know every Republican president with a beard?</UTT>I read that. They all have to be hipsters lol.</UTT>Also, only in 2000 did the red and blue start to be used consistently.</UTT>I know, it seems like that for a long time.</UTT>Right. Do you know that the guest house is bigger than the white house?</UTT>I heard that. I was in the White House when Clinton was in office. Never a guest house.</UTT>Cool to see him once at a conference. A personable guy. Do you know that Zimbabwe's president is called banana?</UTT>I read that, I wondered why.</UTT>I too. Do you know that the Indonesian President is a pop artist?</UTT>I do, but I have never heard of the song.</UTT>I think he released 3 full albums while in office.</UTT>He's been busy as president.</UTT>Sure, talk nice to you and take care.</UTT>Nice to chat with you too.</UTT>Care.</UTT>1

Hello, do you know that 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests are already destroyed?</UTT>I heard it, but it was skeptical. That sounds far too high and what is the definition of "natural"?</UTT>Not sure this is the case. The day was only 5.5 hours when the earth was formed.</UTT>That's 5.5 hours of sun-lit hell in magma and lava. They say we'll be out of helium by the end of the century, bummer.</UTT>That's crazy. If humans represent the history of the earth 24 hours, only 1 minute 17 seconds, then we're so small in the universe sometimes.</UTT>I felt that through sheer distance, actually the UN has an ETS official ambassador.</UTT>I read that and it just convicts me that we are not alone.</UTT>I don't remember Google downing for 5 minutes in 2013. It took down 40% of web traffic. I'd probably blame my Internet provider.</UTT>That's crazy, lol I bet people are so confused, I don't remember it as well.</UTT>Wow, a single Google search requires more compute power than it takes to send Neil Armstrong and 11 others to the moon.</UTT>Wow, that's surprising. I could send someone to the moon instead of google every time I searched.</UTT>Ha! I guess Google once used goats to mow the lawn instead of people. I can't imagine the hassle of managing all the goats. They are mischievous creatures that eat everything.</UTT>I'm true, goats are new to CA now hired to eat your lawn, I see them everywhere, I think they'll be great as long as someone manages them lol</UTT>Recent reading confirms my suspicion that women are always more likely to own an iPhone. Now I'm a dude and I own an Android.</UTT>lol I had an iphone 4 long ago and an android long ago.</UTT>Too many strings seem to be attached to force you to use apple stuff.</UTT>I rightfully know that all their stuff has to go together, like you're being hooked to buy everything they own. It's really annoying.</UTT>I guess that's why we went with Android. Funny Job switched to an iPhone at the presentation because it ran out of power and RAM.</UTT>lol I'm right, I love Android so simple, that's a failure, the presentation can't even last without running out of rams!</UTT>I think the inoperable batteries in the iPhones hurt their market. Funny how Microsoft had a funeral for the iPhone's death when they launched their line.</UTT>LOL!</UTT>I have a MS phone and it's really good, but the lack of available SW products kind of ruin it.</UTT>Sorry to hear. Great to talk to you.</UTT>1

You used to go to a lot of concerts. Do you enjoy the concerts?</UTT>I used to like going, but I don't like it so much anymore. I saw Linkin Park one time back in 2001, it supports hybrid theory. I heard they played over 300 concerts that year.</UTT>That's an insane amount of concerts. I can't imagine how exhausted you are.</UTT>The Ramones can't play over 2000 concerts either. It's a lot of concerts.</UTT>I would love to see that. I assume there is a lot of that in the CBGB.</UTT>I love that too. Back in the day I always wanted to go see the CBGBs show.</UTT>It was a great experience. Do you know of the ancient Roman amphitheater that is still used for concerts in Croatia?</UTT>I would love to see a concert there, it was amazing.</UTT>It's a sure experience. Pink Fluffy recorded a concert in an ancient theater in Powellii, but did it without an audience.</UTT>I would love to fly on a wall for that one.</UTT>I'm too. Do you know that Creed filed a lawsuit over the concert?</UTT>I heard that, guess that's horrible.</UTT>It was so bad that 4 of the attendees sued them, that must have been really horrible to make you want to go through that.</UTT>It must be. I wonder if they won the suit.</UTT>That's a good question, but off topic, I really enjoy clothes and feel your shirt stands out the most in your wardrobe. Do you agree?</UTT>I agree that I have to wear a polo shirt to work all the time. Do you know that polo was originally invented for tennis?</UTT>I don't. I associate them with polo.</UTT>Yep, they were invented by Rene The Crocodile Lacoste and only later adopted by polo players.</UTT>That's very interesting. Do you know the difference between the up and down buttons?</UTT>I don't. What's the difference?</UTT>Down button where the collar tip button is on the shirt, no up button on this. Nice chat.</UTT>1

Hi, are you a football fan?</UTT>I'm a big fan. Age and other concerns make me and you stop. I read Adrian Peterson.</UTT>I'm a Victoria fan too, a bit of a conflict with AP.</UTT>Hahahaha why?</UTT>Before I learned his story of child abuse, it was really fun watching him.</UTT>Wow, was he abused? I'm so sorry for that.</UTT>No he abused his son he played well last season though.</UTT>Wow, what terrible news. He may have been abused too. You know that cycle. I love quaterback and you have it in your favor?</UTT>Maybe the best watcher is Aaron Rodgers. What suggestion do you make?</UTT>Hahaha, you've been around a long time and Stabler knows?</UTT>Stables are more cowboys?</UTT>No, you may be too young from the evil Oakland Raiders. I think most important are the game players, receivers etc.</UTT>Definitely. It's crazy to think that Alex Smith worked to get a master's degree just 2 years after getting a bachelor's.</UTT>He really works hard and began working on a master's degree.</UTT>Something has to be done after football and he broke his leg badly this year so he can do it.</UTT>But he sure has a lot of money left. I never knew circular huddles were invented for deaft quaterbacks so other teams couldn't read his hand signals. Cool!</UTT>They are now using both heads and hand signals.</UTT>You know the New Zealand basketball team is highly black nicknamed "New Zealand Basketball Team". I should google why later.</UTT>They can refer to coffee.</UTT>You're right, I don't know, I'd like to investigate things and will do it later, I read that James Naismith, the basketball inventor, was the only losing coach in Kansas history. Poor guy.</UTT>Interesting.</UTT>1

Hey, do you know that Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph founded Netflix in 1997?</UTT>I heard something like that. The late fee is right on the service for Blockbuster.</UTT>Sure they show Blockbuster. A $40 late fee turns into billions for Reed Hastings and the business.</UTT>I wonder if NFC will disappear like Blockbuster. What's the replacement for streaming?</UTT>I don't know but NFC and YouTube also account for half of the internet traffic in North America at the moment.</UTT>People love their videos, who needs TV when you have a phone?</UTT>True, over 750 pokemon episodes spoken of on TV.</UTT>I've never watched it, was it for kids, they still make that show, it's gone for a year?</UTT>It's an anime. Most of the kids age groups are used to it, but older groups are followed as well. I like Simpsons a little. Only one episode of it where Bart was never mentioned or made any kind of appearance.</UTT>I always thought Bart was annoying. I want to see more about Lisa. She's great, but overall I'd rather be in South Park.</UTT>I think South Park is more interesting. You know the producers received flowers from the Simsons crew after their final episode of "family guy".</UTT>I wonder about that why did they send flowers?</UTT>They seem to send a letter congratulating themselves on reaching 200 episodes and doing it already twice. They are very friendly to the crew. Too bad there is a lot of advertising and TV makes it irritating to sit on the program at times.</UTT>That's why NFC is great. Less advertising = more time watching what I want. I wish I had bought the company's stock. NFC is worth billions.</UTT>I too. Blockbuster declined several different offers to buy Netflix for $5 million.</UTT>I guess Blockbuster is down to their last store now. The NFL should buy it as a trophy.</UTT>Haha, what genre do you watch in movies? I sometimes like drama.</UTT>I like thrillers and drama, I go to the GoT for fun, I watch every episode like 5 times.</UTT>That's really popular. Do you know that drama comes from Greek words for act?</UTT>I don't know about that. I heard the TV drama actors are the "Huge Lorry" guys who get the highest pay.</UTT>Yeah, he's on the house and he's a doctor. He makes $70,000 on the house.</UTT>He's 700, isn't he? I've never seen a show and I'd rather be in comedy than in drama.</UTT>The show has some comedy as well. Jim Carrey stopped doing drama because he didn't want to play in a really negative movie.</UTT>1

Too bad there is a lot of advertising and TV makes it irritating to sit on the program at times.</UTT>That's why NFC is great, less advertising = more time watching what I want, I wish I had bought the stock of the company, NFC is worth billions, people don't love people's videos, who needs TV when you have a phone?</UTT>I too. Blockbuster declined several different offers to buy Netflix for $5 million.</UTT>I guess Blockbuster is down to their last store now. The NFL should buy it as a trophy.</UTT>Haha, what genre do you watch in movies? I sometimes like drama.</UTT>I like thrillers and drama, I go to the GoT for fun, I watch every episode like 5 times.</UTT>That's really popular. Do you know that drama comes from Greek words for act?</UTT>I don't know about that. I heard the TV drama actors are the "Huge Lorry" guys who get the highest pay.</UTT>Yeah, he's on the house and he's a doctor. He makes $70,000 on the house.</UTT>He's 700, isn't he? I've never seen a show and I'd rather be in comedy than in drama.</UTT>The show has some comedy as well. Jim Carrey stopped doing drama because he didn't want to play in a really negative movie.</UTT>0
You know that putting a dry tea bag in a smelly shoe may help absorb the odor. I have some running shoes that no doubt need tea treatment.</UTT>I bet the first person to create a smell-removal product for shoes will make fortunes like a movie hole.</UTT>That is a lucrative innovation. Bright ideas like that can sometimes make someone more money than a lifetime career, not many people get rich teaching.</UTT>I mean, especially if you make shoes for ballet dancers, pro's go through 4 pairs a week.</UTT>That adds up over time. Pro athletes' shoes are generally as well pricey (except for the pair of $15 shoes promoted by Stephen Marbury). Almost everyone can afford that.</UTT>Like the Jordan. Nike was more than willing to pay a fine for continuing to wear the Jordan when the NBA initially banned it.</UTT>It's no surprise they still make tons of money off his name. He seems to be on TV during his prime like all the time. Nike definitely knows how to appeal to the masses with their commercials.</UTT>Ironically then, shoes from 5000 years ago were better in performance than modern shoes today.</UTT>Ironic and somewhat sad. I bet early shoes wouldn't cost thousands for an ancient pair. They probably cost more than fashion.</UTT>I wonder how they are better, such as being healthy or energy.</UTT>That's a good question. They may perform better in durability. I'm not sure, but I'm curious now.</UTT>On a side note, if not, how do you spend your time?</UTT>I like to watch TV when I get the time. South Park is a guilty pleasure and I loved The Simpsons back in the day. Any show you hate admitting you like or watch?</UTT>I must concur. I also enjoy the 1970's show and office.</UTT>Outstanding program, such awesome satire. Some really like Family Guy as well, but I can understand why the South Park creators shot it sometime. It's got stale over the years.</UTT>Was there a show you watched in your youth like pokemon or Thomas the Engine?</UTT>I'm more of a Looney Toons child, but as an adult I think it's cool that George Carlin narrated so many episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine. Who thinks the guy behind Seven Words You Can Never Speak on TV is part of the show about children?</UTT>What are the 7 words you can never say?</UTT>It's a routine that George Carlin did long ago. There are 7 words that can get you in trouble with the big trouble of saying it on TV. It's a hilarious routine, but my mom would tan her hide if she knew no doubt she would listen to it.</UTT>That sounds really interesting. I never knew. Thanks for the enjoyable chat anyway.</UTT>Thanks as well, it's been fun talking to you.</UTT>I hope you have a wonderful day.</UTT>1

Hi, who are you? Do you like comic books? And I very much like one of my favorite Marvel comics.</UTT>Thanks, I've been doing well, I've never really read a comic book before, but recently learned that Marvel has been around since 1939 under the name Atlas Comics. I'm a better NFL person haha.</UTT>Marvel has been around for a long time, I was surprised to find out that Walmart Disney Company had acquired Marvel in 2009, and also enjoyed Netflix very much.</UTT>It's good to know that there is 1/three of the bandwidth in North America. I wonder if that will impact the quality of users. I'm not very knowledgeable in that area.</UTT>That must mean most people watch Netflix after dark. I think it's really cool how Netflix is created because of late VHS fees lol.</UTT>Yeah, I think so. I wonder if I watched at 2pm, or if the movie was a bit glitchy (I seem to have that issue sometimes, but I can connect to the internet). Cool, and totally relateable. I don't remember being able to return things when I was younger.</UTT>Comics: NFC seems to have many shows about superheroes or popular superhero stories, which makes them even more popular, in my opinion. That entertains us a lot considering there are over 300 registered superheroes in the USA alone.</UTT>I find a lot of documentary watching, but I'm looking for new movies to watch. I have to check out some of Stan Lee's Batman/Superman superhero movies. You should, too, sound kinda funny as Normanman.</UTT>I like Disney's more teeny or family descendents, but as an adult I still enjoy them. It's about the kids of the Villians, you might like that too. So much for the choices I don't see the normalman. Sound good.</UTT>That sounds good and family friendly as well. I love Garfield. I wonder if Netflix has an old episode that reminds me of my childhood. I also think female superheroes are awesome so I can check out some of those superheroes too.</UTT>I answered your question before: I like Superman more than Batman. Superman reminds me of my childhood and I love Christopher Reeves, and female heroes are often called super heroes. I like women of wonder. That movie is in the movie "Batman".</UTT>Wonder Woman is a new woman. Thanks for the info youtube. I was surprised at the same time that Netflix and YouTube made up half of North America's Internet traffic. People would guess they loved watching stuff.</UTT>I think people like the ability to stream movies and videos anywhere and even on a cell phone. Technology has become so advanced that it is a modern day way to watch TV, Netflix and YouTube. I am surprised at the size of other countries, but Netflix has Netflix.</UTT>Wow, that's pretty impressive, and I wonder if those statistics apply across the world. I can't see why Nineline started offering everything online because they spent 20 times as much bandwidth on posts.</UTT>I know it's a huge company. Other companies like Hulu, Sling etc have total subscriber worldwide (they're starting to pop up too, too) but Netflix is so much better than renting videos I think so far.</UTT>Yeah, I have an Amazon Prime account so I'm watching there too. Crazy to think the world has changed in just 10 years. I think it was when I first got my smartphone.</UTT>Like Netflix? Amazon Prime? I think it's just for shopping.</UTT>Yes, there are a lot of different benefits you get from your Prime account.</UTT>I certainly checked out Amazon Prime. Thanks for the tip. Really nice and informative chat today.</UTT>I didn't mean to send that message so quickly, so the little clicks were happy. Unfortunately I also subscribe to Amazon Music, but there is an extra monthly fee. Same, nice talk, have a nice rest of the day.</UTT>Thanks, have a good day, enjoy your superman movie.</UTT>1

Hey there, would my friend like to dance?</UTT>I saw a public dance. A complaint was filed and a restraint order issued.</UTT>Haha I never hope. I never knew Bruce Lee was a great dancer. Back in the 1950s he won the championship.</UTT>Bruce Lee is known to have inflicted lethal damage in the early rounds of the dance challenge. Competitors are hobbled and unable to complete the later rounds.</UTT>Haha, they should make a movie about that. If he wasn't taken from us so soon, then only. You know ballet dancers can go through about four pairs of shoes a week.</UTT>Personally, my feet cause me to go through more. I think ballet dancers must have the hardest working feet.</UTT>They do. I actually date one person on the toe and they always super mess up.</UTT>You look at the sun, I mean really look at it. Actually the sun is white, but only because of the so called "atmospheric scattering" it looks yellow. I think there is something fishy going on.</UTT>Wow, I don't know that why did they not teach that in school? Haha, that's actually useful, lightning bolts are also crazy hotter than the sun's surface.</UTT>Lightning may be a source of energy for us in the future. Harnessing lightning to save our planet.</UTT>I hope so, or maybe it'll help us travel back in time with a flux capacitor haha. Do you know Michael Jackson has a patent?</UTT>Michael Jackson put his coolant patent. He had other patents for hyperbaric oxygen chambers.</UTT>Haha, that's insane. He has a patent for the extremely lean movie he made. Like the device he created.</UTT>Lean movie. I don't know if he made the movie.</UTT>Ohhaha I mean lean moves, do you know that babies actually dance to music and dance to their beat?</UTT>Even with special shoes, a baby can lean like Michael. Probably not. Jackie Chan just won like Michael.</UTT>I wish they could be. He should patent a baby leaning device haha. Also, Pac did ballet in high school. I wonder if anyone has a tape of that.</UTT>Tupac probably bought and burned the tape. Pac didn't play that.</UTT>Hahaha I like that. It's crazy that the sun produces enough energy to meet our energy needs for the next 500k years. I hope we can harvest that someday.</UTT>Keep trucking, brother, patent a way to harness lightning, leave the sun to the next generation.</UTT>Hahaha good idea. Do you do anything fantasy at all like fantasy football?</UTT>1

Hi, who are you tonight? You don't like American footbals or other kinds of footbals.</UTT>I actually like American football, but I don't like soccer. What about you?</UTT>Why do you dislike soccer? It's too slow and there's not enough blood. Hahaha.</UTT>Haha, yes, you can say that. I just think it's really boring, haha. But each knows that the top bowler of the 60's made more than the top football player then.</UTT>The bowlers are lucky that the NFL hasn't really appeared yet. TV can focus on the bowling. No way now. Blood and violence aren't enough to bowl.</UTT>I agree that watching the bowling was even worse than watching the stalker. Have you ever heard of a football game that scored the highest?</UTT>I'd probably be like a bowler scoring. That's college ball too. Lloping team?</UTT>Haha I think the team is definitely lopsided. Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland. That day, their fans were annoying.</UTT>I guess someone with a schedule screwed up there really. Why play such a good team? Silly.</UTT>Yep, it doesn't seem fair. You've never watched football on TV, though. You know the yellow line in the TV broadcasts that marks the first down. That's what the ESPN created.</UTT>I see that line and other things like field goal distance, red zone, stuff. I think it's obvious that this thing was added with a computer.</UTT>You think so. It seems very obvious, so I don't know why they won the Emmy, but oh well, haha.</UTT>EPN must be too proud of that award. What do they do for follow up? You don't get a chance to do much reading.</UTT>I read some from time to time. I saw Starship Troops, but never read the book. Apparently the US military should have read.</UTT>Heinlein is the author. He is in the Navy so he has written a lot of books on military themes.</UTT>Add that to the sense. Never read Ender's Game. I hear it's a good book, but I personally don't like the movie.</UTT>Great book, I haven't seen the movie, I just think some of the books just don't translate very well to the screen (tolkien's is pretty good though).</UTT>Very few books end up well transferred to the screen. You are right, reading at a speed, by the way?</UTT>Not really fast reading. I think it might benefit some situations, but I wonder how much you retain.</UTT>I remember trying it, and I can't retain anything, so I don't believe in the world record. You can't retain anything at 4700 words per minute.</UTT>I guess you get the gist and some things are enough. But you're trying to learn complex material?</UTT>I think you got your point there. You heard of the moral panic of the 18th century. Too many people read so I guess that's not a big deal anymore.</UTT>1

Hey, what do you think of Trump?</UTT>I have mixed feelings, I think he could have done some aspects better. What do you suggest?</UTT>I believe he is disgraceful and looks back on history as poor. I can't believe people bought anything he said. Like macro, he puts words in people's mouths on the European military.</UTT>Good, I agree with you, I don't want to say I hate him and end up liking him. In my opinion he sucks.</UTT>He is completely unjoking, terrible and a moron to support. Seriously, the dumbest people have to be. I hope he doesn't win in 2020. If I didn't move to New Zealand, I'd be moving to New Zealand.</UTT>LOL you sound like my brother Matt. He said the same and also moved to New Zealand.</UTT>See EU members and multinational brigades?</UTT>Do you know that Zimbabwe's President is nicknamed Banan?</UTT>That's crazy, you know Angela Merkel and like Germany?</UTT>I just know we kicked Germany's butt during WW1 and WW2.</UTT>I wonder if Dee fought in WW2.</UTT>Famous soldier Dee.Trump.</UTT>Not sure what his name is, I'm also not sure what branch he is in though.</UTT>I've never heard of those people. I'd have to research them. Do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Radio? Is there any technology that uses those crazy radio waves to carry information like sound and stuff?</UTT>Crazy stuff. What mode of radio can potentially pick up a radio storm from Jupiter?</UTT>Wow, I wonder what they say about government. The organized community, often called the state, is governed by a system or group of people. I wonder if they have a government on Jupiter.</UTT>I think Trump's new space force could bring democracy to Jupiter and even Mars.</UTT>If Wikileaks didn't publish their plans to go there and colonise there, the only thing the US would do is bring democracy to the oil, so I'm sure a ton of it would be there.</UTT>Sure preach it, you know the govt owns 86 percent of Nevada, they have to experiment in some places.</UTT>Call the area Area 69?</UTT>Cooler area 51. Nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Good Morning, how did you do today?</UTT>Fine. Reading is a complex cognitive process of decoding symbols to derive meaning.</UTT>I really like reading. Do you know the list of members of the US Military Branch that reads?</UTT>It's amazing. Reading is much reduced in the day now. People are engaged in social media.</UTT>Technology makes me read more. It's more convenient to use my phone and read.</UTT>The teenagers are mainly focused on social media. They don't read books, novels or newspapers.</UTT>That's true. Do you know that Cs Lewis and Tolkien held a competition to laugh at you lost while reading terrible poetry?</UTT>Mental panic over the spread of reading novels.</UTT>It seems that people are always afraid to gain knowledge.</UTT>Many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps, have been suggested to read Enders game.</UTT>I really like that book. You know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature for US censure. That's crazy.</UTT>Sir Winston Churchill won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1953.</UTT>That's pretty cool. I heard that architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were Olympic events from 1912-1952.</UTT>The development of printing technology will allow for ever growing distribution and proliferation of written works culminating in electronic liteatures.</UTT>That's kinda neat. A year-long literary contest challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel.</UTT>Literature is any body of written work. It is used for a very interesting depth of knowledge, culture and people.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>Thanks.</UTT>Have a good day.</UTT>There are more libraries in the United States than McDonald's.</UTT>That's neat.</UTT>1

I heard that architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were Olympic events from 1912-1952.</UTT>The development of printing technology will allow for ever growing distribution and proliferation of written works culminating in electronic liteatures.</UTT>That's kinda neat. A year-long literary contest challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel.</UTT>Literature is a mental body of written work. It is used for a very interesting deepening of knowledge and the novel and a thankless morning.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>Thanks.</UTT>Have.</UTT>There are more libraries in the United States than McDonald's.</UTT>That's neat.</UTT>0
Who are your favorite animals?</UTT>Hello, I love dogs, dragons, orcas, sharks and octopuses, suggest.</UTT>Haha I do love dogs, chimps and dolphins, yes I wish dragons existed, I do too. You know there are 2 billion animals on earth right now.</UTT>That's a lot. I don't even know what a billion is. I wish there were miniature dragons other than the Komodo dragons, too. That's scary.</UTT>Yeah, you're right, I don't actually know zero, it's crazy that animals can be up to 30 meters long. I wish I knew more about animals. I then started becoming a zoologist.</UTT>Haha I wish I knew the meters. I heard of an animal representation lawyer in Switzerland. How can he do that and talk to them?</UTT>Great question, Germany also gave animals the Constitutional right, I wonder what that was. That was done in 2002.</UTT>I don't know if an animal has a dominant hand or paw, I have to see one my dog uses more lol</UTT>Well, I don't know that. You don't know the story behind the hiccup as well?</UTT>Hiccup story? Do you know that lobsters and jellyfish are immortal?</UTT>That's pretty awesome, although I'd like to eat lobster right now, and when the animal appears to have gills and lunges, the hiccup is a holdover.</UTT>Oh right, I don't mind having gills if I mean I can swim longer and deeper.</UTT>Wow, that sounds awesome. We can both have you all together and swim together, but you've never seen Waterworld. They definitely can hunt down those people. You may believe the Loch Ness monster is a special protection against them. The Scottish Government has done what it has done.</UTT>Oh, that's a cool movie, throw some web feet too, that sounds good lol I'd rather have a gill and a web foot in my tail.</UTT>LOL, that sure sounds awesome. Do you use facebook at all? We need to make a Waterworld page of only Gill.</UTT>Yeah, I use facebook, we should see if one exists already, it seems easier, lol.</UTT>It appears that Ireland re-wrote its constitution on facebook. I think we should only write a constitution for Gill.</UTT>That probably saved them a lot of paper. You know there are more people on facebook than there were 200 years ago.</UTT>Wow, that's crazy. What do you know about their promotion of the Burger King Whopper on facebook?</UTT>I think they offered a whopper because they weren't friends with people. Was their friendship worth a whopper?</UTT>Yep, haha, but you have to unfriend 10 people. I can definitely find 10 people I haven't unfriended.</UTT>Great talk, have a good one. lol</UTT>1

Right now you know there are 2 billion animals on earth. Who are you sabotaging?</UTT>That's a lot, I'm not good at $1 billion lobsters haha I'm sure there are miniature dragons other than the Kimodo dragons, that's scary.</UTT>Yeah, you're right, I don't actually know zero, it's crazy that animals can be up to 30 meters long.

Do you have someone put a lighter near your ears to heal the earaches?</UTT>No way, how does that even work?</UTT>The article said the author's father rolled up a newspaper in a cone and lit it thinking it would heal earaches.</UTT>Wow, I'm thankful my parents didn't follow the tradition to cure earaches, I wonder if he's exhibited in Baltimore at Parenting: :op?</UTT>Hahaha I'm serious, you think there are some of the things on display.</UTT>You remember Simpson, Homer, or Margaret. I can picture a lot of the displays of some of the years' antics. I'm sure it's filled with well-intentioned, loving mistakes or crazy fears of the parents.</UTT>I've seen the exhibits now, they're heartbreaking and hilarious, they have to span all sorts of parent debacles.</UTT>Absolutely, anyone can be a typical parent, even Charles Manson had a son, I can't imagine growing up under his shadow.</UTT>Whoa, I don't know if he has children, does the child even know him?</UTT>I don't know, but the exhibition uses art to portray families like him and other dysfunctional families. I hear it is an exhibit of emotion.</UTT>It sounds like it. That exhibit, especially, portrays his mother who committed suicide and his abusive father.</UTT>Very sad indeed. I like the piano analogy that expresses the childlikeness of the piano. Just having one doesn't mean you can play with your parents (it reminds me of the Hundenburg tragedy when they brought in a 356 pound grand piano on the flight).</UTT>What happened during the tragedy?</UTT>The Handenburg crashed and caught fire. In 2006 some climbers found the piano on the top of Britain's highest mountain. I know the Handenburg caught fire, but it makes you wonder how they made it to the top of the mountain.</UTT>Sure the piano did, you think it was the reason the plane crashed, or just an odd coincidence that the piano was aboard?</UTT>Not because the piano caused the crash, or fame like the piano used to record Bohemian Rapsody and Hey Jude. I wonder what song was broadcast on the BBC in 1930 instead of news reports.</UTT>I know you think it's classical music, there must be something to appeal to the masses.</UTT>I'm not sure, but the news must be really dull to end up playing piano music. Too bad we didn't do that today. We should also be allowed to equip our cars with flame throwers to prevent carjacking in South Africa. Now that's newsworthy.</UTT>Haha that's newsworthy and dangerous.</UTT>Yes, our trunks aren't made of wood anymore, that could be a serious fire situation.</UTT>Great to chat with you.</UTT>1

Do you like the NFL?</UTT>I'm a big fan of sports and sports trivia in general.</UTT>Sounds great we're getting along, I'm a sports fan as well, do you have a team in your favor?</UTT>Definitely not the Saints. I'm not a fan of them having pretty sexist policies on cheerleaders and players.</UTT>That rule is so unfair, makes me angry, and really humiliating.</UTT>Yeah, you can't believe they can't even eat in the same restaurant. Not only that, but if the player comes in mid meal, he has to leave.</UTT>It's a terrible rule, and one that really humiliates and humiliates me when I have to leave with my special friends and family, and I'm so angry and feeling so bad.</UTT>Oddly enough, do you know that the league doesn't have written rules saying women can't play?</UTT>I don't think that will ever happen, watching women play in the NFL.</UTT>They could play as long as they meet the league requirements for qualification, apparently.</UTT>I bet women can be as capable of the game as men if they have the same strength.</UTT>Anyhow, it sounds like increasing female engineers is worth a football career as engineers earn higher lifetime earnings than football players.</UTT>Oh, I see, I agree that sexism can be another issue, and the money engineers make is amazing.</UTT>Although considering that it's an average game with only 11 minutes of actual gameplay, what football players make is pretty crazy.</UTT>Only 11 minutes. How scammy. The game lasted 60 minutes and less than 25 were accounted for.</UTT>Even televised games last longer than an hour, from what I've experienced. I suppose we could use tracking chips on players' pads and balls to find out how they really spend most of their time.</UTT>That's a great idea, we can tell how much distance they actually run, calories, many different stats about the game, cool facts and stats.</UTT>They use tracking devices more specifically to track velocity, rotation, ball speed and location.</UTT>Do you like basketball as well?</UTT>I like it less than football, but I think it's funny that the US Supreme Court has a basketball court on top of it called the highest court on the land.</UTT>That's a great name for the court. It must be really nice to play or watch a game in the court. Judges must play tournamet all the time.</UTT>1

How did it go with ii. Watch a horror film. ii. Edgar Allen Poe and Mary Shelley inspired the first one.</UTT>I love horror movies and I'm a Stephen King fan.</UTT>Kind of strange that Stephen King considered "Bambi" a horror movie.</UTT>Right, it had to make him so scared as a kid. Sometimes I think good, shining movies. The boys in the movies didn't know horror movies until years later.</UTT>I was surprised that the boy from the Shining show couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scene of the bloody elevator and the creepy twins.</UTT>Right, or the guy broke through the door. I wonder how the movie was in the box office.</UTT>Pretty scary probably, and apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie.</UTT>Dang, I need to watch 10 a night for my diet, because I don't do anything else.</UTT>Watching a horror movie too makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable.</UTT>I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?</UTT>I have no clue, there is probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie.</UTT>I bet. You know it's only scary that Disney's Treasure Island will make $309 on a budget of $115 million.</UTT>That's pretty horrible. Disney's Treaty Planet also was a huge flop in the box office.</UTT>Sorry, I mean Treaty Planet. On Valentine's Day, the silence of the lamb comes out. Can you imagine that date?</UTT>Well, it can't be that bad, because Silence of the Lambs made 27.5 billion dollars at the box office.</UTT>I'm sure it means bringing your date to it. It's almost as crazy that Disney shut down their studios because of a sleepy beauty failure.</UTT>That's crazy, like Tom Hanks because he grosses over 85 million at the box office?</UTT>He should be in every movie with that much money man. I think you guarantee to make money at that rate.</UTT>Yea Tom Hanks is the highest-drawer of box offices all time.</UTT>That amazes the great actors. I had a good chat with you.</UTT>Have a good one.</UTT>1

Hello there, enjoy a comedy movie or TV show?</UTT>I enjoyed both of them. What about you? I love Comedy Central, but hate that it has canceled over 100 shows since it began in 1989.</UTT>I really love comedy in movies and TV. That's a crazy amount of cancelled shows.</UTT>I agree, you can also believe that the Green Lantern movie with Jack Black was an initial comedy. I'd like to see that.</UTT>That's pretty funny, I saw that.</UTT>Have you ever watched Rock From the Sun's 3rd episode? I was so happy to win the best comedy series Golden Globe in 1997. It had some stiff competition but still won the awards and they deserve them.</UTT>I used to watch that show years ago when it still aired. I think a lot of friends fans are upset. I don't care about my friends.</UTT>I honestly don't. What about Kung Fu Hustle? I kind of agree with Bill Murray's basic statement that modern age comedy has achieved supreme achievement.</UTT>I think I read about that back when he said that and thought he was super sarcastic.</UTT>Maybe so. You are also a fan of the British comedy group Monty Python. The people who created the Python Programming Language basically named it to honor it. I think it's cool.</UTT>I used to love to watch that movie as a kid. I think that's a really cool tribute too.</UTT>What a true story, do you like Incredibles 2 in terms of comedy? I enjoyed it, although the present day events were set in the way of the 1960s.</UTT>I think it's pretty good and I think it's cool to set it back then.</UTT>I think it's only funny that director Brad Bird uses artists who are likely to be fired or quit Pixar because they believe they can create what they need. That's smart of him.</UTT>That's pretty wild, I guess he also did one of the voices in the movie, and probably saved a dollar.</UTT>Yeah, he probably did. You know, 13 years before the video game, Incredibles 2 and River of the Underminer came out.</UTT>I never knew that. That's kinda crazy though, some conspiracy theorists out there probably talk (lol).</UTT>You may be right about that. Have you ever played a Nintendo Entertainment System in a video game? Hard to believe it can only display 54 colors.</UTT>I used to love playing that when I was a kid. We played Tecmo Super Bowl the whole season with all my friends..</UTT>I love it as well, in fact I can't believe it was not discontinued in Japan until 2003. I figure it was long before that.</UTT>That's one hell of a video game system, I'll talk to you nice today and have a good one.</UTT>1

You use facebook?</UTT>All the time as business and personal accounts.</UTT>Nice to have a personal account. You can imagine how Facebook bought Myspace back in the day for 75 million.</UTT>They are definitely a lot more relevant today. I haven't been in my space since 2006 anyway.</UTT>LOL I too think MySpace is ruining this. Facebook is worth 1.4 billion now.</UTT>So Mark Zimmerburg is nice.</UTT>Sure, he's been in the press too much lately, and I can't do it.</UTT>Facebook is blue because he is actually color blind.</UTT>Wow, I don't know that. I always thought there was too much blue. Have you ever participated in the Burner King promotion?</UTT>No, I can eat well for free, I can get rid of some of my friends on the list whopper.</UTT>I sure do have tons of friends, to which I can add, lol.</UTT>Sure it is used a lot, even Iceland uses it for constitution rewriting input.</UTT>That's hilarious. I wonder if they got some crazy idea. At least they allowed a similar button and some German state made it illegal.</UTT>I've heard that before. I wonder how that works if some sort of geofence disables it for all while they're in that region.</UTT>I just thought the same, sounds more illegal than anything lol.</UTT>It really does kind of like censorship.</UTT>sure it isn't here at least, like fish, lol.</UTT>I like looting them and not so much eating them. I would like them to be like those immortal jellyfishes, that's cool.</UTT>LOL, that thing can't die. That must have happened in a way. How nice to chat with you.</UTT>Great chat, have a great day.</UTT>You too, great weekend.</UTT>1

I find space fascinating, what about you?</UTT>I do too. Can you believe the sunset on Mars is blue?</UTT>I have no idea. I bet that is beautiful. You know the sound on Mars may have a higher pitch than the Earth.</UTT>I believe it. Mars is so cool I'm glad we got to do more research up there.</UTT>I agree, if you could only fly to Mars at a constant acclimation of 1 kilogram, that would be something we could accomplish someday.</UTT>I'm sure we are. I think it's cool when a curious robot sings happy birthday on Mars.</UTT>Wow, that's adorable, lichens and cyanobacteria may apparently live on Mars. Do you think we found microscopic life on Mars?</UTT>I hope we do. Do you know why we call it mars?</UTT>I don't. Why do we call it Mars?</UTT>It is named after the Roman war god. Interesting, isn't it?</UTT>Very interesting. I should guess that because so many celestial bodies are named after god. Do you know that satellites have been lost on Mars?</UTT>I haven't heard that. What happened?</UTT>Because Loché Martin used the imperial system, but the Nasa uses it metrically. Whoops.</UTT>Maybe they should have planned that a little better. I think it's epic that the sun makes up 99.86 percent of our solar system's mass.</UTT>I don't know that either. That's mind boggling.</UTT>I agree. There are even radio stations that translate the sun's activity into sound for you.</UTT>Interesting to listen to that. Do you know that the sun is actually white?</UTT>I don't know about that, and wonder why we see it as yellow.</UTT>It is caused by the scattering of the atmosphere.</UTT>That's so interesting, the earth and everything is so exciting, I've had a great chat with you well.</UTT>Nice to chat with you as well, have a lovely evening.</UTT>1

I think it's epic that the sun makes up 99.86 percent of our solar system's mass.</UTT>I don't know that either. That's mind boggling.</UTT>I agree. There are even radio stations that translate the sun's activity into sound for you.</UTT>Interesting to listen to that. Do you know that the sun is actually white?</UTT>I don't know about that, and wonder why we see it in yellow. I don't believe it. Mars is so cool, I'm glad we got more research done up there.</UTT>It is believed that the atmosphere is fascinating.</UTT>That's so interesting, the earth and everything is so exciting, I've had a great chat with you well.</UTT>Nice to chat with you as well.</UTT>0
Hi, have you watched Brooklyn 9?</UTT>Hi, I didn't, but I heard it was canceled. Are you a big fan?</UTT>I'm a big fan. Fox cancelled it, but NBC picked it up. It has such a good writing about it. Do you watch a lot of TV?</UTT>Oh, that's good, Fox lost, seems to have cancelled a lot of shows people really like. I watch a lot of TV.</UTT>I watch a little TV but always have live sports on the back ground. I'm not sure why.</UTT>I'm just glad Fox didn't cancel The Simpsons. After all these years, I still find it funny.</UTT>I too. They did have some infighting at one point though. Fox News wants to sue Simpson.</UTT>Yes, Simpsons often makes fun of Fox, when you think about it, the show doesn't really fit into their other programs, but they know they make so much money from it, it's weird at the final end of it, Homer had so many different jobs for years.</UTT>How many jobs does he have?</UTT>Well over 200 now. He has 188 episodes in over 400 firsts and has a lot more new jobs.</UTT>Wow, if I changed jobs that often my wife would kill me. And Mr. Burns had to always be a good guy to take him back to the plant.</UTT>Haha, true, Mr. Burns isn't as evil as some of your beliefs. The only reason I'm still looking forward to Halloween is the new Treehouse horror episode.</UTT>That's good, the only time we really see aliens is when we see them.</UTT>Kang and Kodos, so a few weeks ago i went to buy a new TV and they had to go to the warehouse to get one for me. It took forever for the guy to come back. Turns out when he looks at the old black and white television he finds an old one.</UTT>Really, that's nuts, how big is it ii?</UTT>Just a little, maybe 15 inches, so it probably went unnoticed for so long. Amazing how much television technology has changed. Way better led than the plasma I replaced.</UTT>Yeah, I remember we had small TVs we took on camping trips and they never worked.</UTT>Interesting that even simsons cartoon televisions have been replaced with moderner televisions than the old ones they have. 3d televisions have never taken off.</UTT>My friend has one and it's so uncomfortable to watch it in glasses. I think that would be better if they did the sport 3d.</UTT>Maybe, but if you just go watch events live you can go that far. I agree they are too uncomfortable.</UTT>Great to chat with you, have a great day.</UTT>1

Hi, have you ever played on a nintendo?</UTT>I love my Nintendo, but I haven't played it in years.</UTT>Do you know that it only has 54 colors?</UTT>I actually did. I seem to remember it stopped being made around 2003?</UTT>It's a great console and so much fun to play.</UTT>You're a football fan. This season will be a great end to the Super Bowl.</UTT>I'm sure. Do you know that women can play in the NFL too?</UTT>Yes, I'd have heard that, but it's never happened. I'd like to work with the actual rocket scientist, Matthew Patricia.</UTT>Wow, that's pretty cool, and career must change.</UTT>His school's RPI has the best fighting song. iii includes the sin cosine, tangent and the 6th digit of the 6th digit.</UTT>Haha that's so awesome, only 11 minutes of live gameplay in the game.</UTT>That's not very much. That's why engineers have to make more than NFL players.</UTT>Yup, that makes sense. They also have longer careers, so they might help a bit there too.</UTT>Do you know of the first NFL playoff game in 1932 on an 80-yard-long dirt field?</UTT>Cool, not knowing that. Have you heard of those rules that New Orleans cheerleaders must abide by?</UTT>They have to leave the restaurant if the players walk in. That's awful.</UTT>Sure that is, I really think it's outdated and needs to go.</UTT>I can't see the Saints allowing female players, but it is definitely allowed.</UTT>I guess. Do you dislike Brady?</UTT>Tom Brady is an amazing quarterback who won 6 Super Bowls.</UTT>He's sure. The guy didn't stop. Nice chat.</UTT>1

What form of entertainment do you enjoy?</UTT>I breed chickens, I'm just kidding. I enjoy movies, radio and music. A good movie soundtrack really hits the spot. What about you?</UTT>lol Nice intro.</UTT>Thanks, I could get a job with Steven Spielberg. He could play clarinet like he did on the Jaws soundtrack, and I could pretend to be a talent. What do you think?</UTT>I always like it when the director or producer plays a part like Stan Lee.</UTT>Or M. Night Shamalan spelled? I also like celebrities mocking themselves like Kyanye West on SNL. Taylor Swift may not enjoy mocking though.</UTT>True, I agree.</UTT>You have to sense humor about this thing. For instance, Taylor Swift automatically released 8 seconds of white noise that ended up top of the Canadian charts. Tat made a great comment about Canadians enjoying his music.</UTT>I guess it's all about the brand.</UTT>Maybe. Do you think her tendency to walk backwards to avoid taking photos builds a brand?</UTT>No, I genuinely think the paparazzi are jerks.</UTT>I agree, it would still be nice if she had a 40 million dollar jet and a personal airport hanger in Nashville..?</UTT>True.</UTT>Let's change the subject to something more profound and significant. Ever read Starship Troops because it's on the list of 3 of the 5 military branches, so that must be a good read?</UTT>I've read it and Enders game. Great books both.</UTT>Have you experienced mental panic from that novel, like so many did in the 18th century when reading the novel?</UTT>LOL, of course not.</UTT>I would love to attend one of the famous laugh and lose contests of CS Lewis and Tolkien. I might end up being the biggest loser.</UTT>Indeed, it's really fun to watch. Kinda like a Harmon quest.</UTT>And it's really lovely that they read their horrible poetry at speed out loud. I don't know a record of achieving 4700 words per minute, but it's fun to watch them try.</UTT>Indeed. Thanks for the chat anyway.</UTT>1

Good Morning, who are you today?</UTT>Hi, who are you? Good for me.</UTT>I do well, you're a football fan at all?</UTT>I watch sometimes. I try to watch the Super Bowl.</UTT>It was so boring this year. Even more boring was knowing that it was only 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>I think the game is better than previous years. Big comeback in the end. Yeah it seems too short, but people love it. So much violence but people love it.</UTT>Oh, I agree. I bet the game was better in 1916 when Cumberland lost to Georgia Tech (lol).</UTT>I wonder what the coaches think there. I think it's a shame that a game like that happens. What's the point?</UTT>I feel like the team just gave up from the beginning. They could have a pink locker room like the Iowa Huckeye visitors.</UTT>That pink locker room stunt, did that work at all? I doubt you Iowans won a lot at home?</UTT>I don't think it's going to work, I'm a Hawkeye fan and they seem to be winning more on the road haha.</UTT>If it works, other teams will do the same. If it does, it's still a fun fact.</UTT>Well said. Can you believe the Green Bay Packers have been around since 1919?</UTT>I can. That's a strange name though. What exactly do they pack?</UTT>I'm not sure. I know they started based on the name Indian Packing Company.</UTT>Oh, that makes sense. They are meat packing companies and they own the teams, and I think the city owns them now.</UTT>I know they will pay for the Packers first uniform if they name it after them, they made a good move because they have sold out every game since 1960.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder how much it costs someone to buy a tix, so the secondary market is expensive.</UTT>I agree, I wish I was in the first game they lost to the Beloit Fairies, that's a unique football name for them.</UTT>So what name would you like to play for that team? Hello, I'm a fairy, I'm not serious, great chat anyway.</UTT>Hahahahaha too funny. Have a great day.</UTT>1
Good Morning, who are you today?</UTT>Hi.</UTT>I do well, you're a football fan at all?</UTT>I watch sometimes. I try to watch the Super Bowl.</UTT>It thinks so every year, even more so when there is a doubt that it was so in only 11 minutes haha.</UTT>I think the game is better than previous years. Big comeback in the end. Yeah it seems too short, but people love it. So much violence but people love it.</UTT>Oh, I agree.</UTT>I wonder what the coaches think there.

Do you like horror films?</UTT>Not really, do you like them? I heard watching them could burn calories.</UTT>I don't really like them either, but if I can burn 180 calories then I can give them a try lol</UTT>LOL, I heard that. It's weird, but for some reason watching horror movies can make you like abstract art more.</UTT>I saw that. That was interesting. I liked the Shining movie. Have you seen that one?</UTT>I saw that one a long time ago. I guess if you can call it horror, Bram Stoker will catalyze my favorite movie. I deeply fear his Salem lot.</UTT>I do too. Danny doesn't even know he's in a horror film and is tricked into laughing out loud.</UTT>I guess they did that so they didn't scare him (read any of Edgar Allen Poe's books) Some horror movies today were inspired by his work.</UTT>I have, he has a great poem, I think his contribution is important, and authors like Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley certainly have transformed things.</UTT>They really have. I wonder what makes them write what they do. It was so long ago. I mean, the horror has been around for over 100 years.</UTT>I guess their stories are so dark that they bore the genre of horror. They may not have that in mind to influence literature such a way.</UTT>Literature can't have an effect on TV too. You can't sometimes tell, but I mean over 750 episodes of pokemon, but I really have no idea what that inspires in the old literature.</UTT>Well, I loved pokemon, one of my favorite shows, and I've been a fan of the original pokemon for over 16 years.</UTT>I just mean I like it too, I just don't see where it can get inspiration, it could just come from animal general studies. The creator of pokemon might be a zoologist.</UTT>That's an interesting question. I think they are. After all, there are 2 billion animals on the planet, so there are plenty of places to look for inspiration.</UTT>That is definitely true, you can even look back at the early life when some animals had gills and lunges.</UTT>I think that's why we have a hiccup, as some kind of holdover from the previous year.</UTT>You're probably right about that. Thinking of old dinosaurs and such makes me think of the Loch Ness Monster. Do you know what species are protected in Scotland?</UTT>I don't know about that, guess it would be good if the hunter decided to get it as a trophy, it would be amazing to see the Lochness Monster live.</UTT>It does it truly, I'd like to think it's real and somewhere in the deep, unexplored depths of the ocean. I mean over 1 million animals know and estimate over 700,000 so maybe it is.</UTT>I think we just have to look harder, we can find it, and I hope to live by then.</UTT>1

Hello, are you interested in the President?</UTT>I love the republican leader, what about you?</UTT>I find the history of the President fascinating. Do you know the 3 richest presidents?</UTT>JFK was one of them. I'm less sure of the others.</UTT>iii) Jfk, Washington, Jefferson.</UTT>But Washington has wood teeth, don't you think he can afford ivory? Pres Banana of Zimbabwe has the original tooth?</UTT>I'm not sure, but I wonder why they called him banana.</UTT>He can go soft on crime or his stage can be named to prepare for the release of his new disc. He must catch up on the standard Indonesian president set release albums.</UTT>I think it's funny that he's released 3 pop albums.</UTT>That's funny. Another funny fact is that people who used to finish out the presidential election automatically earned the spot of President. Imagine what would have been created if that rule was in place.</UTT>That's probably crazy against the views.</UTT>The governor is a crazy entity. Do you know that the Fed owns 86 percent of Nevada?</UTT>That's crazy, I wonder what they're doing with all that property.</UTT>They just needed some of it to store the Eiffel Tower, which they bought from some impersonators of the French government.</UTT>I heard he sold the tower twice!</UTT>Incredible. At least the Norwegian governor didn't bite. They tied up their money with a dollar pledge to help save rain forests on Amazon.</UTT>I wish more people could pledge that much money.</UTT>I wonder what the French dude would accept to pay for the tower. All in confidence states like Nevada have shown slots for none of these candidates on the presidential ballot.</UTT>I'm not sure, I need to do more research.</UTT>Find out which President is the tallest in your research. Taller candidates have won over 70 percent since 1900.</UTT>I'll look into it. Have a nice day.</UTT>1

Good evening. Do you have a chance to travel much?</UTT>Hi.</UTT>I don't travel a lot. And certainly not the first King of Hawaii, Kalakaua, who actually traveled around the world.</UTT>I hit entry too soon sorry, I visited Italy in 2018 and we visited Iceland in 2017 I am surprised tourism in the US is down. Do you think it is a political environment?</UTT>It can be. When you're on the island, do you take a flight to go city to city, there aren't really any rail providers?</UTT>We rented a car because we had 2 weeks and could get all the way in the car. Good drive and we went in October so we didn't have to contend with the snow.</UTT>I went to Hawaii and Germany, but it was usually just the US. I didn't mind going to Japan, but I heard the toll was very expensive.</UTT>In Italy, the travel across the country costs $300. When we finally exit the road we take a toll road and have to hunt for the 28 euro. We are on the Malfi Coast in October and I am really surprised how crowded it is. I can understand what the article says.</UTT>Countries usually have to really plan and prepare for tourism, but if they don't plan appropriately they definitely have trouble dealing with the influx of travelers.</UTT>We saw that in California. Places like Big Sur have so many tourists taking selfies in iconic places and they either leave the trash or do something dangerous just to get a perfect picture.</UTT>Maybe it's time to go to a simpler place, like Michigan Island, where they still use horse drawn carriages and cars banned.</UTT>People eventually find all the great spots. The article mentions Emilia Romagna or Extramadura. I have never heard of either of those places.</UTT>Well, you can go there sometime soon. I think I'll take that on a trip to any of the theme parks at Walmart Disney though.</UTT>How many times have you never been a fan? I went with my daughter's family about 2 years ago. Zoo and 3rd month was unfavorably the most popular.</UTT>I think Disney in general is just an issue with it (I can't deny their success though) I find it interesting that they chose celebrities like Bill Nye to work with for the Blubber movie.</UTT>They are suggesting a business model of reinventing something. Then there is the animated film Beauty and Beast and the Broadway musical and then there is the live action movie.</UTT>I find it lazy to make a hit from an already hit. I guess they have some original content like Big Hero 6 where they use a big supercomputer to render the whole thing.</UTT>Right, but not sure how successful Big Hero 6 is. Interesting fact about telephones. Sounds like fake news that UNICEF donates clean water to children in need every minute you don't use your cell phone. How do they know?</UTT>Why don't they just get clean water anyway? You think we can male an iphone that has more compute capability than the US's ICBM capabilities.</UTT>Good point, well looking forward to hearing more about the 160 mph bus (I'm not sure I want to ride it though).</UTT>As long as it is safe and efficient, I doubt I will see anything like that near me anytime soon.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>Same for you.</UTT>1

The article mentions Emilia Romagna or Extramadura. I have never heard of either of those places.</UTT>Well, you might go there sometime soon.</UTT>How many times have you never been a fan? I went with my daughter's family about 2 years ago. Zoo and 3rd month was unfavorably the most popular.</UTT>I think Disney in general is just an issue with it (I can't deny their success though) I find it interesting that they chose celebrities like Bill Nye to work with for the Blubber movie.</UTT>They are suggesting a business model of reinventing something. Then there is the animated film Beauty and Beast and the Broadway musical and then there is the live action movie.</UTT>I find it lazy to make a hit on an already hit. I've pointed out that the phone has a cell phone with business people like Big Hero 6 where they use a big supercomputer to do the whole thing but it's not.</UTT>Right, but not sure how successful Big Hero 6 is. Interesting fact about telephones. Sounds like fake news that UNICEF donates clean water to children in need every minute you don't use your cell phone. How do they know?</UTT>Why don't they just get clean water anyway?</UTT>Good point, well looking forward to hearing more about the 160 mph bus (I'm not sure I want to ride it though).</UTT>As long as it is safe and efficient, I doubt I will see anything like that near me anytime soon.</UTT>Nice to chat to you.</UTT>See:</UTT>0
Merry Christmas. I was just about to watch something on NFC.</UTT>Merry Christmas! What do you watch?</UTT>I thought I'd watched "Stranger Things" - have you watched that series yet?</UTT>I do. They did a great job showing the music, clothing etc. of the 80's.</UTT>I look forward to it. The NFL has really come a long way in just a few years.</UTT>They absolutely did a great job, going to dozens of movies in 2016 like 2 and in 2018 they will go to dozens.</UTT>I agree. They haven't completely eclipsed HBO, but they definitely put themselves in front of the nomination.</UTT>But the GoT didn't get most awards. I don't remember.</UTT>I know it's a banner program for HBO, I bet the GoT is expensive to make but still does really well.</UTT>Yes, but sometimes having so many TV shows from NFC doesn't mean high quality as well.</UTT>I guess if you put a lot out there something is bound to be good. You can believe that nonebrowse accounts for 1/3 of all bandwidth in North America between 9am and 2pm.</UTT>Sorry, I don't understand that. Netflix accounts for 1 percent of all of North America.</UTT>The bandwidth they measure things like using the internet/wifi. A lot of people really mean to watch Netflix every night.</UTT>I wonder how they measure that.</UTT>I believe it is measured by the network you use. It's crazy to think someone who racks up late fees for movie rentals will start Netflix, regardless.</UTT>Rent movies, did that founded NFC?</UTT>His name iseed hassises.</UTT>He probably sat on the beach drinking whiskey, so he doesn't have to work anymore.</UTT>I know. His company is worth $2 billion and another declines its chance to buy it for $5 billion.</UTT>Do you know that is a company?</UTT>That's Blockbuster, which used to rent movies but is now bankrupt I believe.</UTT>And they want to buy out Netflix?</UTT>I don't know who initiated, I know they think 50 million is too much. Have a Merry Christmas.</UTT>1

Do you like Shakespeare?</UTT>I do. Do you know he popularized many words and phrases?</UTT>Like good riddance in my heart and many more.</UTT>Yes, he lived the same as Pocahontas too.</UTT>I wonder what it might be like they met somehow.</UTT>Yeah, do you know that Tchaikovsky was obsessed with Shakespeare?</UTT>He donated his skull to be used eventually in playing.</UTT>And it was used on Yorick's skull in the hamlet.</UTT>Yea, do you know he also invented some names?</UTT>Names like Jessica, Olympia, Miranda.</UTT>Yeah, and some of his plays have to be played in old English because the meaning has changed.</UTT>Yes puns don't work in modern day language if not.</UTT>Yeah, you don't like drama?</UTT>I do. Have you ever seen a House MD?</UTT>Laurie makes $70,000 an episode on that show.</UTT>That's a lot. Do you like Jim Carrey?</UTT>He's so funny, do you know he doesn't do drama anymore?</UTT>Because they don't project positivity.</UTT>I guess that makes quite a bit of sense.</UTT>Yeah, nice to chat with you.</UTT>Same here.</UTT>1

Do you like dogs?</UTT>I sure am, I love dogs, by the way, who are you?</UTT>Good, thanks. Dogs are so smart, the only animals that can naturally understand the point, except the elephants.</UTT>I think dogs understand quite a few words too. They are smarter in quite a way than chimps.</UTT>And they are not color blind like I was once taught.</UTT>I think they are colorblind too. I guess they see some colours with sense. They have great ears and noses too.</UTT>Apparently they can see as much color as we can. Do you think that is true?</UTT>That sounds funny. It thinks that the visual cortex of humans is far more developed. Can we resolve?</UTT>That may be right. In Istanbul you can get food for strays by recycling bottles at vending machines. Pretty interesting.</UTT>I think that's a clever idea. It's good to involve dogs in keeping the city clean. And they get fed.</UTT>Haha, true, dogs can also donate blood at blood drives, I'm not sure how I feel about that, they don't seem to really be capable of consenting.</UTT>True, but dogs will probably like to help if they can. Dogs are usually pack animals, they look out for each other.</UTT>That may be why we love them so much. Google even prefers dogs over cats and says so about their conduct code.</UTT>I think dogs are pretty good in the office. People pet dogs and their mood improves. I love working in the office with dogs.</UTT>Commute to work?</UTT>Sometimes. I do a lot of telecommuting.</UTT>I guess we had the Model T in 1908 thanks to the easy commute. Karl Benz invented the modern car, however.</UTT>Every car maker owes Benz debts Ford makes cars available to the common man.</UTT>Cars are really fast adopting in the US, although it takes awhile to accept them in other parts of the world. Glad we don't have to travel on horses and carriages anymore.</UTT>There is a tremendous problem with city manure, it is ii pretty stinky, great chat anyway.</UTT>Nice chat, I guess it was time to drive.</UTT>1

Hi, do you use Facebook much?</UTT>I do. Have you ever used MySpace?</UTT>They had a chance to buy Facebook for 75 million dollars and they didn't.</UTT>Too bad they could make billions by now.</UTT>Yeah, true. Do you know that similar buttons are illegal in parts of Germany?</UTT>I wonder what happened there to make it illegal.</UTT>Yeah, you know why it's blue?</UTT>Mark is colorblind in green and red.</UTT>Yeah, they used it to rewrite the constitution in Ireland!</UTT>I wonder how that works, it's pretty public.</UTT>I know, have you watched much TV?</UTT>I do. Do you watch Simpsons at all?</UTT>I did. There was an episode where Bart didn't appear at all.</UTT>And he didn't even mention himself in it.</UTT>Yeah, have you ever watched That 70s Show?</UTT>It doesn't do well in the UK but it does good.</UTT>It failed after just 10 episodes because they verbatim remade it.</UTT>Yeah, have you ever watched Thomas the Tank?</UTT>Do you know that Alec Baldwin did the voice for 52 episodes?</UTT>And Ringo Starr and George Carlin did too. What a cast of actors.</UTT>I sure know the cast is star studdy, I'll chat to you nice today.</UTT>1

Hello, who are you today?</UTT>I'm great, who are you?</UTT>Well done too, would you like to use Amazon?</UTT>I like to use Amazon sometimes. It can be quite convenient. Are you?</UTT>It really is, I did too, I'm getting just about everything there now haha. Even on Sunday.</UTT>I am amazed that the USPS delivered on Sunday. I think that guy never worked on Sunday. They have to get triple overtime.</UTT>My day is postman, but he never had to go out on Sunday. It's usually $16 an hour for a part timer. Kind of sad you asked me.</UTT>Okay so post offices aren't expensive to deliver. I guess part time workers need them. It's probably better than an Amazon warehouse.</UTT>Haha, I agree if you don't want to walk 7-15 miles a day for work.</UTT>I guess it keeps your shape or it kills you. I don't think pay is good either.</UTT>I heard terrible work was done there. Wish I had the first person to purchase an Amazon back in the day.</UTT>You can have a building named after you. I'd rather have Amazon Prime for life.</UTT>But hahaha, you can at least brag about the building because everybody has a Prime.</UTT>That's true, I wonder if people know his name, he might stick to a warehouse job too, lol.</UTT>They probably told him the best job in the world (he was a joke though) I like using google a lot as well.</UTT>I use google a lot. Google is a dog company. I approve.</UTT>I approve with two thumbs up. They also like goats too and let their landscapers in haha.</UTT>Goats get stock options? If so, sign up for me.</UTT>LOL, they probably are better than us. Well, it would be nice to chat with you.</UTT>Enjoy the chat with you, have a good day.</UTT>Thanks as well.</UTT>1

Have you ever seen Keeping up with the Kim?</UTT>I know a bit. I know Kim was born on October 21, 1980.</UTT>She and her family basically just do everyday things. Do you know she named her baby Chicago?</UTT>I know, it nods to Kyanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K, so the name is perfect, Chicago is hard to conceive, so it's extra special as well.</UTT>That's pretty sweet, do you know who used to be a personal assistant to Paris Hilton?</UTT>I know. She gained first attention from the media that way, but after the 2003 sex tapes leaked in 2007 she became really popular.</UTT>That.</UTT>I know one of my kids used to play with Kim Kinda's app on his phone. I think it will come out in 2014.</UTT>I'm sorry for that, I accidentally pressed enter. I didn't use the app but I heard it. She was also in the fallout boy music video. I wonder what song?</UTT>I don't know if she was in the music video. I know she and her family began appearing on reality TV show Keeping up with the Kim Kardashians after a sexual tape leaked in 2007.</UTT>That's really lucky that the sexual tapes were released, I'm pretty sure her mom released them on purpose.</UTT>Maybe. I know Kim is on the 100 most influential people list in 2015's Time Magazine.</UTT>She definitely has a lot of influence. She recently met with Trump to discuss prison reform.</UTT>I don't know about that but it's good for her. I also know she has a book about being a trailblazer in the selfie movement.</UTT>She's definitely a busy, hard working person. As for celebrities, do you know that Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode?</UTT>Holy cow, that's a lot of money. I wonder how she rates Hollywood's likability quality score. I know Tom Hanks is 48, Kim 71, hilarious.</UTT>I've never heard of a quality score, but it sounds really interesting. I think most of Kim's probably not good at being likable.</UTT>I must agree. I know critics and admirers describe her as an example of the notion of her being famous for that reason.</UTT>Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of actual talent. She's just wealth and fame now. They always come up with new ways to stay in the spotlight.</UTT>I agree, but it is reported that she is the highest paid reality personality in 2015. Her total earnings exceed $5 million.</UTT>I guess if I made that much money from it, I would do some silly stuff like that. Nice to chat to you.</UTT>1

Hey, what did you do today?</UTT>I'm great, you're concerned about me.</UTT>I do pretty well, just trying to get rid of some hiccups. Do you know that the holdovers were from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lunges?</UTT>I don't know about that, so interesting.</UTT>I know, it's pretty neat how our anatomy correlates with animals. Do you know that animal studies are called zoology?</UTT>I remember taking zoology in school. Do you know there are over 7 million animal species?</UTT>That's pretty wild. I recently learned about about 2 billion individual animals on earth. That's amazing.</UTT>That's amazing. I'm shocked to learn recently that some animals can theoretically live forever because they are biological immortals.</UTT>Wow, that's really interesting. You know, in 2002 Germany became the first country in the world to give universal legal rights to animals guaranteed by the Constitution.</UTT>I heard that, and I also read somewhere that there are animal court representatives in Switzerland. How wild is that?</UTT>That's pretty wild. I heard the Loch Ness was a protected species under a provision of the 1912 Scotland Protection of Animals Act.</UTT>That's wild now. I'm so interested in animals. I learned to be like humans and have dominant paws or sides in college.</UTT>They are definitely interesting. Do you know that when they are domesticated they develop white patches on the forehead?</UTT>Cool, I also learned that animals from geographically distant areas often speak different languages or dialects just like people.</UTT>That's interesting. I wonder if my dog speaks south dialect?</UTT>My things definitely do, I'm so glad the world appreciates and respects animals more. I've read that the Netherlands are constructing a special bridge for wildlife.</UTT>I wish they would do that here. It's heartbreaking to see dead animals on the side of the road.</UTT>I too. The bridge connects habitat and keeps animals from hitting them by cars. Such a good thing that it is necessary to construct it here.</UTT>That helps so much here that I don't see why they didn't do it.</UTT>I agree. I'm 50, and I just found out what E. stands for at Chuck E. Cheese, different note.</UTT>I have no idea how it stands for things, I always thought it was Eugene or something like that.</UTT>Nope, you're wrong. It's entertainment. Charles Entertainment cheese. Well, it would be nice to chat to you. I'd have to get it to work. Talk later.</UTT>1

This whole topic is really tough. Moonves was just fired for it and lost millions.</UTT>Sexual misconduct charges are very serious and must really affect the entertainment industry considering his role.</UTT>I'm just so sad that all the victims are. It puts them in such a bad spot.</UTT>Victims have a lot of power to stand up for someone in such a position, it has to be hard to stand up for someone. Harry Weinstein's story about women sets the bar high.</UTT>The producer received flowers from Simsons crews as South Park aired its final episode of its family guy series, which was of a lighter note.</UTT>Sweet gesture that is. There are actually 750 episodes of pokemon. Have you seen any?</UTT>I have ii in pass. I have a 7 year old. What about you? I'm a pokemon fan.</UTT>Kids used to like it, but I guess they've outgrown it. Only one episode of Simpsons without Bart.</UTT>I don't know about that. The 1970s show was verbatim remade in the UK. A day like this was cancelled after 10 episodes.</UTT>The woman was never nominated for the best Academy Award for Cinematographer.</UTT>It really has to be strange that women aren't nominated. I feel they should at least be nominated.</UTT>Think about it, but the best cinematographer is nominated 13 times for the Oscar, not for the best cinematographer.</UTT>During his visit to Britain around 50 years ago, Cezar noted that British people breed chickens for food and entertainment.</UTT>I wonder how they entertain. Bill Nye seems to be entertaining and he broke the entertainment by winning a similar contest with Steve Martin.</UTT>Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because the entertainment executives didn't think he had that presidential look.</UTT>That's funny. The Nintendo entertainment system was discontinued in Japan in 2003.</UTT>What is the real switch? It seems weird.</UTT>That may have been the original meaning. It's talking about the entertainment system only displaying 54 colors.</UTT>I don't know that, only 54?</UTT>Entertainment such as stories, music, drama, dance and other performances exist in all cultures.</UTT>Nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Bill Nye seems to be entertaining and he broke the entertainment by winning a similar contest with Steve Martin.</UTT>Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because the entertainment executives didn't think he had that presidential look.</UTT>That's funny. The Nintendo entertainment system was discontinued in Japan in 2003.</UTT>What is the real switch? It seems weird.</UTT>That may have been the original meaning. It's talking about the entertainment system only displaying 54 colors.</UTT>I don't know that, only 54?</UTT>Entertainment such as stories, music, drama, dance and other performances exist in all cultures.</UTT>Nice to chat with you.</UTT>0
Do you like cars?</UTT>I do. Do you know when the drive thru was invented?</UTT>That was back in 1975 for McDonald's.</UTT>And you know why they invented it?</UTT>Yes, because the fatigued soldiers were not allowed out of the car.</UTT>Yeah, do you know why the car trunk is called such?</UTT>Because old cars used to have wood trunks.</UTT>Yes, do you know how Cadillac gets it?</UTT>After the founder of Detroit, de la Mothe Cameron.</UTT>Yeah, do you know Jonn Marshallborough?</UTT>He became a professional driver by beating people with great turismo.</UTT>He beat 9,000 staggering people though.</UTT>Yeah, in South Africa, you can put the flame throwers in a car to protect it.</UTT>Wow, cool, do you like the NBA?</UTT>Sure I do. Do you know Kareem Jabbar?</UTT>He's a guy who uses dunk shooting so much that it's banned.</UTT>That's crazy, and in a good decade.</UTT>Yeah, do you know who invented the game?</UTT>Coach at U of Kansas James Naismith</UTT>And the only coaches in their history who have lost are losers as well.</UTT>Yeah, pretty ironic, I'll chat with you nice.</UTT>1

What did you do today? I watched TV.</UTT>I watch TV as well. I watch The Simpsons. Funny how Homer keeps switching jobs.</UTT>I actually watched The Simpsons as well. Only you know that Bart was not mentioned or even advised?</UTT>I don't know about that, I must watch that episode. Do you want cool facts about The Simpsons?</UTT>Of course I do. You seem to know a lot of cool facts about Simpsons.</UTT>I really love the show, so Homer had about 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes of the series, which means he had different jobs every 2 episodes.</UTT>That's nuts, you also like pokemon?</UTT>It's just one of my favorite shows.Charizard and Pikachu are the best. Do you like the show?</UTT>I absolutely loved it, I watched over 750 episodes.</UTT>They are a lot. Crazy fact about the TV deal, but most of them show the word "shark tank". They seem kind of random.</UTT>Yeah, they kind of seem random. I really like another Family Guy show. I think it's hilarious.</UTT>It's really funny, I like it a lot and you seem to enjoy comedy a lot.</UTT>Oh yeah, I do. I enjoy watching Comedian Central a lot.</UTT>I thought that was a great channel, watching a movie with Drew Carey the other day, which was really funny.</UTT>Interesting fact, Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since it was created.</UTT>That sucks. I bet this upsets many fans. Kinda reminds me of the NFL canceling many of my favorite shows.</UTT>Oh yeah sure, I bet if the NFC also showed some sport, it would be a lot more popular.</UTT>You can be like baseball, are you a baseball fan?</UTT>Yes, I am indeed. Baseball is so popular all over the world. It's even popular in Japan.</UTT>It's iii. I don't think Japan is a baseball fan, and you know that a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from favoritism after striking out Babe Ruth and Lou Giral.</UTT>It's iii. I guess it's so popular in Japan that many people are surprised to discover it's also popular in America.</UTT>Yeah, nice chat and keep in mind the opposing team will receive 3 bases next time you watch the game if the player catches the ball in his hat.</UTT>1

Hello.</UTT>Hello, do you know that government is shut down because of Trump?</UTT>I realize that this President is very crazy at the time.</UTT>I agree, Zimbabwe's first president is dubbed Zimbabwe's president. He must like bananas.</UTT>Haha that's an odd name for a president. It's as funny as an Indonesian president who made 3 pop albums while in office. He has to have a lot of time on his hands.</UTT>I know, the president in Indonesia is like the Asian version of Nye West. Doesn't he want to run for president?</UTT>I heard on TV that Kyanye wanted to run for President. I don't know how well she is, but it's more crazy. It's almost funny how Congress has a Fantasy Congress so they draft their own members. Much comedy.</UTT>Has he talked to Trump recently? He wants to make a political difference? A member is drafted? That's what I think of a basketball player being drafted from one team to the next?</UTT>Nye was in the White House for a visit to the President too long ago. It's very crazy. Nye had to shut down his social media accounts because of the backlash.</UTT>I'm curious why Kyanye did that. Now I know why he stopped his social media.</UTT>Yep, public speaking isn't really good for Kyanye, but I'm sure he's blown over. Did you see President Trump address The Union tonight on TV?</UTT>Oh, I thought so.</UTT>I'm just curious, I missed it, but I'm sure there will be replays later on TV.</UTT>I didn't plan to watch it, I only waited on the news for the result.</UTT>Social media already talked about it. I'm probably not going to watch TV tonight anyway. I have a couple of TV shows to watch. Do you watch TV?</UTT>I watch TV, not politics, I find a lot of pokemon episodes crazy beyond what I expected.</UTT>Over 750 episodes over 16 years. I don't know if it's still on TV.</UTT>It's on TV, they also have it on NFC, I loved the first season of the pokemon show, Ash is still 10 years old these days.</UTT>Oh really, I don't know if it's still anywhere or if it's rerun on TV. I watched the Simpson rerun.</UTT>They should be on TV reruns, Simpson's reruns are only online anyways, I prefer.</UTT>Oh, I watched them, it was also fun to watch That 70s show, one of my favorite TV shows. It was a great chat.</UTT>It was a great conversation.</UTT>1

Are you interested in TV shows, I said?</UTT>Actually, I said hi, what about you? I love The Simpsons and there are episodes where Bart never appears and isn't even mentioned that I still want to see. I bet it's weird that I don't see Bart at all.</UTT>That's a different story. I've never seen that episode. When Simpsons aired the Family Guy finale, the producers received flowers from the Simpsons crew.</UTT>Wow, that's very nice of them, are you a fan of the 70s show? I want to see the UK remake, but it only lasts 10 episodes, sad.</UTT>I'm a fan and have heard of that UK show. It's called a day like this and I haven't seen it either.</UTT>I get that even though the 70s show remake only lasts 10 episodes, pokemon has over 750 episodes, like 50 episodes in 16 consecutive years.</UTT>That's an insane amount of shows. You've ever watched Thomas the Tank and you know the three narrators. They all did it for at least 52 episodes each.</UTT>I correctly heard it was George Carlin, Alec Baldwin and Ringo Starr. I think that's pretty cool and would just like to watch it to see if I recognize their voices.</UTT>Nice, you get them. I remember George and Ringo, but I don't remember Alec.</UTT>I still think it's cool they did that, they make a lot of kids' days, but I also enjoy watching the Earth show (in fact, I saw the Earth being freed from helium pretty much at the end of the century recently, I'm not sure if that's good or not).</UTT>I agree. My kids watched it. I'm not sure about helium either. I know people who like to suck it into balloons and talk about high pitches don't like it.</UTT>Ha, that's a good point, they certainly didn't. But on earth it's sad that over 80 percent of our natural forests have been destroyed.</UTT>Indeed that is sad. I'm always surprised to hear that when 71% of the Earth's surface is covered in water, I'm always hearing about water shortages.</UTT>Tell me about it how that can happen? Today, do you know that the Earth was only 5 hours long when it formed? I imagine it would be the case. We haven't accomplished anything.</UTT>LOL, we don't. If the Earth's history is viewed for 24 hours, the human represents 1 minute in 17 seconds.</UTT>And at a short time, we have already destroyed so much, sadly. Did you hear that the UN would appoint an extraterrestrial ambassador if they ever contact us in 2010. I think that's pretty neat?</UTT>That's neat, I wonder who it is. Do you know when McDonalds added the first drive thru?</UTT>I heard it was added to soldiers who weren't allowed to exit their cars fatigued back in 1957. It's weird, initially I thought the car was always around. We've come a long way since cars became widely available in the early 20th century, haven't we?</UTT>I always think like that too, I kinda just take them for granted, always. It's fun to chat with you.</UTT>I think that it's crazy what else is related to cars that your vehicle is actually legal to equip with flamethrowers in South Africa to prevent cars (I'm glad I don't live there) Well, it's fun to chat with you friends as well.</UTT>I'm too. I didn't catch myself there. Thanks.</UTT>1

Glad the episode didn't live there. It's just been a consecutive chat with you friends.</UTT>I'm too. I didn't catch myself there. Thanks.</UTT>0
Have you heard of the brouhaha in Panama City?</UTT>I don't, it sounds quite crazy though.</UTT>I'm not sure I understand all the stories, but it sounds like conflict has international repercussions. Do you play instruments?</UTT>I own a piano, but I don't.</UTT>The piano has an interesting history. It was invented by the Italians.</UTT>And I think how it makes sounds is so complex, hammer-stricken strings, but it is so simple.</UTT>I guess a keyboard instrument plucks strings before a piano. Why would someone put a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain? Britain's eccentricity doesn't know bounds.</UTT>Or what about the 356 pound grand piano in the airship lounge?</UTT>One made of aluminum. I wonder if it sounds tiny.</UTT>Probably. Piano music can be quite entertaining. In April 1930 the BBC broadcast piano music instead of reporting news because they decided not to.</UTT>That's a pretty bold decision, I wonder if any news station can get by reporting a little less. They need to fill the time to keep the advertisers.</UTT>That's true, but back then it's probably quite different. Do you just know a song to test stress on an auto piano?</UTT>I guess the song is needed because humans cannot impose enough stress on machines. I've never heard a tune, I wonder who wrote it.</UTT>Good question. Have you ever tried to play?</UTT>I don't have any music bones in my body I do better video games.</UTT>I can find the note and about it. Are you a car connoisseur?</UTT>I enjoy driving but don't have the money to make it a serious hobby.</UTT>My husband desperately wants to own a Chevrolet. They are named after French explorators.</UTT>If you were a uniformed soldier, would you take a Chevy to a McDonald's drive thru? I guess you would.</UTT>Ha, true, now everyone does it, whether soldiers or not, of course.</UTT>Great chat!</UTT>1

Hello there, enjoy watching a comedy show or movie?</UTT>I like comedy, what do you think? Do you think Bill Murray achieved the supreme comedy achievement of Kung Fu Hustle in the modern age?</UTT>Comedy is one of the genres I'm sure I'll watch, I think Bill is just sarcastic, but that's me.</UTT>I can't say I agree with Bill on that one. I haven't seen the film. What about Jack Black? Don't you like him?</UTT>I've been seeing for about 5 minutes and that's enough for me yeah I think he's pretty funny what do you suggest?</UTT>Jack is a natural comedian. The original Green Lantern film staring Jack Black was a comedy. I'd like to see that version. Wonder what Bill Murray would have said.</UTT>That would be very interesting if he got that part.</UTT>Hard to guess what the executive thinks about comedy. Awards show too. In 1997, the third Golden Globe for best comedy series was won by Rock from the Sun, beating Seinfeld, Friends and Frasier.</UTT>That show is pretty good, but I've always been a fan, aren't you?</UTT>I like Seinfeld quite a bit. Good thing he wasn't on Comic Central since it was created in 1989. Comic Central has canceled over 100 shows.</UTT>Wow, that sounds very hard to cut from that network.</UTT>Why didn't South Park get cancelled lol I like that show, I figure they'll be around for a while more.</UTT>That show was really something when it first came out. LOL I remember my mom not letting me go to the movies.</UTT>It's pretty vulgar, what about Monty Python, did you not see that?</UTT>I used to watch all those old movies growing up. Have you seen the tributes they do to them?</UTT>I didn't see that. When was that?</UTT>I guess the person who created the Python programming language named it in honor of them.</UTT>Nobody is going to put Python on a comedy channel or cancel it.</UTT>That is probably true, and a good call.</UTT>Comedy Central, they should call it Comedy Morgue. Anyway, enjoy the chat. Have a good day.</UTT>Yeah, here's a good one.</UTT>1

Hey, do you believe in aliens? Perhaps there was a sighting of an UFO on the February 24th flight.</UTT>I find it interesting that pilots apparently saw UFO objects over the Arizona desert.</UTT>There seems to be a lot of sightings of UFOs over Arizona. But it is not all clear with a pilot saw.</UTT>Kind of creepy that the control center in Albuquerque doesn't record anyone passing a plane.</UTT>Yeah, I agree, who knows what he's seen, there are also a lot of sightings in Nevada, the US government owns almost 86% of the land, they can experiment.</UTT>The US government may investigate some of the UFO reports.</UTT>Yeah, I think they'll find anything, I wonder if they'll find anything. Sometimes I have a hard time, like when they plan to destroy WikiLeaks.</UTT>I don't know, but the pilot described hovering UFO objects above his plane pretty well.</UTT>That's kind of interesting. He said there were aircraft on the front and he was reporting something was passed over, but he didn't get much more specific than that. Balloons could and could not be said.</UTT>The pilot said the object was a big reflection and doubted it was a balloon.</UTT>Oh, interesting, and they are troubled by it several thousand feet above them in the opposite direction. Very interesting.</UTT>Interesting that the air control asked for a google ballon. I don't know what google is doing with that type of stuff, but I just think they'll stick with online ads and search engines.</UTT>It seems Google is doing a lot more than just working on their search engine. They also calculate traffic by tracking how fast Android phones are moving on the road.</UTT>That doesn't sound like Google is getting accurate traffic results because a lot of people don't use Android phones.</UTT>That's a good point. A lot of people rely on Google. In 2013, it went down for about 5 minutes and took 40% of web traffic.</UTT>That's a shame. Crazy how Google tailors their maps to each country's claims at disputed borders.</UTT>That's quite interesting what they do. They also hire a lot of goats to trim their lawns instead of hiring people to mow them. That's kind of funny.</UTT>It's pretty funny what companies do with search engines that require more computing power than sending men to the moon.</UTT>That's a very good point. I'd like to learn more about that. I wonder what Neil Armstrong and the other 11 astronauts think about that.</UTT>idk, it's pretty crazy, like a man who can sell the Eiffel twice.</UTT>I'm just happy that Google was founded back in 1998, I'd be nice to chat to you and see you later. I'll use Google so much though.</UTT>1

A lot of people are good at Google instead.</UTT>That's a shame. Crazy how Google tailors their maps to each country's claims at disputed borders.</UTT>That's quite interesting what they do. They also hire a lot of goats to trim their lawns instead of hiring people to mow them. That's kind of funny.</UTT>It's pretty funny what companies do with search engines that require more computing power than sending men to the moon.</UTT>That's a very good point. I'd like to learn more about that. I wonder what Neil Armstrong and the other 11 astronauts think about that.</UTT>idk, it's pretty crazy, like a man who can sell the Eiffel twice.</UTT>I'm just happy that Google was founded back in 1998, I'd be nice to chat to you and see you later. I'll use Google so much though.</UTT>0
Would you like to read?</UTT>I did. You do what you do.</UTT>I enjoyed it, it was so relaxing.</UTT>Ditto, do you have a favorite genre?</UTT>I like fiction, self development, mindset, business are usually similar books.</UTT>Same, I'm reading the first 90 days now. I switched jobs and needed some help.</UTT>That sounds like a good one. My favorite subtle art is not giving a fuck. If you don't mind profanity.</UTT>I didn't. Who wrote that?</UTT>Mark Manson. A great book on living your best life, no matter what others think.</UTT>I must check it out. Fiction or not.</UTT>No fiction. I'm surprised it's not on the military reading list. It's far better than the Ends game.</UTT>Moral panic in the 18th century, be thankful we didn't have it.</UTT>Sure, reading is so valuable regardless of genre.</UTT>I agree. The world record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute.</UTT>I don't know my rate, but I'm sure it's not anywhere near fast. That could be anywhere from 5-10 minutes, I guess.</UTT>I'm a brain too. Tell me to start being smart about working out so I don't push my brain too hard.</UTT>But I think if you laugh you lose a lot of fun reading poetry.</UTT>If you aren't a laughing one, some schmoes just won't laugh, but Lewis and Tolkien.</UTT>I would love to be a witness to that.</UTT>Yeah, I always wanted to party with a few authors. Sure, Hemmingway.</UTT>He's probably having the same fun as Dr Suess.</UTT>Yeah, nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Have you ever eaten popcorn with a chopstick?</UTT>No. You are suggesting. Did you eat it in any non-conventional way?</UTT>I'm not. However, if you do, you'll apparently find popcorn much more enjoyable. They'll enjoy it when you pay more attention to something entertaining.</UTT>That's what the article says. I'm throwing popcorn in the air and trying to catch it in the air. It makes eating fun, but I can't think of an unconventional way to consume water can I?</UTT>There are a lot of ways to ship envelopes and pringles cans (although I prefer to win that) and even martini glasses. Use your creativity.</UTT>I think I'd like to try a non-conventional way of eating pizza instead. I don't think I'd be very successful eating with chopsticks, but I can have fun with blindfolding. Does that sound fun to you?</UTT>It might be. A pitch black restaurant might be interesting too. I have no idea how those waiters find a table, though.</UTT>What a true story, I think it's interesting why they call your car's trunk a trunk, it seems so funny now.</UTT>It makes sense. I want to become a professional race car driver because it is pretty good for video games.</UTT>You really? I find driving in a video game harder than driving on the road in a car. I can see how it could help your driving skills.</UTT>There are certainly a lot more obstacles to be avoided in video games. I rarely have boulders coming down the road. The hardest part for teenagers is though to drive through.</UTT>Thank goodness we don't have all those obstacles on the road coming from you. It's bad enough to stick in rush hour traffic.</UTT>Yes, 10 mph is surely easier to deal with than 100 mph. However, in South Africa where having a flame thrower in your car is illegal.</UTT>Whoa, don't mess with the cars in South Africa. I think I might like to try out that Dutch commuter bus that travels 160 mph.</UTT>That sounds crazy. I want to travel to Europe, but Ireland doesn't have any trains, just planes to get town to town.</UTT>Europe is fun, I just don't think I'd like to go to Ireland, whether by train or not, it sounds very cold.</UTT>Greenland is colder than Ireland. Japan is expensive though. All of Japan's highways are tolled.</UTT>Yeah, rolling highways are pain in the neck, it greatly increases your travel expenses. I think it's cool to try out Michigan Island and travel in horse drawn carriages the old way. That's cool.</UTT>Sure life is paced at a slow pace, I bet the King of Hawaii who traveled the world first had a slow pace as well.</UTT>Funny but until recently the world worked at a slow pace of life. We are now very impatient and want quick travel, instant access and all that.</UTT>And everything is online. Without my Reddit for social media, I couldn't live without it.</UTT>1

Do you like jazz music?</UTT>Sure I do. Do you know why trumpeters have goatees?</UTT>That's because it makes playing mush more comfortable.</UTT>Yeah, women host jazz concerts in their places every day.</UTT>Yeah, an impressive lady in Harlem for 20 years.</UTT>I know right, you know the best jazz orchestra in the world?</UTT>That's a strange but cool one, it's a Pakistani one.</UTT>I know right, Clint Eastwood seems to be a huge fan of jazz also.</UTT>Yes, you like guitars as well?</UTT>I do. Van Halen once set a speaker on fire by playing his music.</UTT>I guess he's that good. Do you know Brian May?</UTT>The lead guitarist of Queen, and also a scientist.</UTT>And he never used the pick, just a coin.</UTT>What a cool thing Pink floyd has an actual boat recording studio.</UTT>Why not right? Never heard of Hybrid Theory.</UTT>After all, it was the most sold album of this century.</UTT>Yes it is. Have you heard of the band reel big fish?</UTT>That's a band that has lost its right to its music and later re-recorded its hist.</UTT>Yes, the twins in Japan released a rap album at the age of 100.</UTT>Wow, I'd like to hear about it, but I wonder if it's any good.</UTT>Actually, I too, and a nice chat.</UTT>1

Hello, are you watching TV?</UTT>Hi, I've watched some TV, do you use NFC?</UTT>I watch some TV. I used to have NFC when it was based on mail. lol.</UTT>Do you know that they pay people to watch Netflix and tag content?</UTT>I'm not surprised there are the same stores on Amazon for reviews. I understand they now have 137 million subscribers.</UTT>That's a lot of subscribers, I don't watch TV enough to need to subscribe, if I want to watch something, I get a digital disc.</UTT>In a DVD, Blockbuster turned down the NFC purchase.</UTT>I don't know about that. I guess they feel they are doing well the way they are.</UTT>NFC started because of late rent fees.</UTT>I probably helped with that. It's terrible to remember I returned the digital discs and books. You know Netflix has an hour long video on the fireplace.</UTT>Haha I actually have that. The NFL entered the content production in 2012.</UTT>I bet that's cool. I used to run a fish aquarium screen saver on my computer. Things like that sometimes beat other movie content.</UTT>You can get aquariums and fireplaces on YouTube now. They account for 33 percent of North American traffic between them and Netflix.</UTT>Thanks for the info, I must get that. utilities is my favorite place to go on video. I especially like the documentary.</UTT>I mean crazy, I mean 33 percent at 12:00pm and half of peak internet traffic in North America.</UTT>Oh, it's a lot either way, like Justin Bieber?</UTT>I'm not Bielivber.</UTT>Good punt, either i or. Some guys with the same name banned from facebook. Poor guys double lost.</UTT>Actually having his name makes him a celebrity and I'm sure he gets a view. Anyone who gets a view is paid.</UTT>I think that is probably why he was banned. It doesn't seem fair, but Facebook isn't always fair.</UTT>Oh right, lol I guess he can try Instagram and twitter, nice talk.</UTT>Same here, have a good evening.</UTT>SetC-WP-01</UTT>1

Do you like baseball?</UTT>I love baseball. Opening day is only 2 weeks later.</UTT>Wow, I really exited only 2 weeks away. I've watched most of the World Series though.</UTT>Some pretty remember world series over the years. It was first held in 1903.</UTT>Wow, you like Babe Ruth?</UTT>I mean, I've never seen him play live, but I think he's the best player ever. He helped make the Yankees a powerhouse.</UTT>Back in 1926, he cost his team the title because the best people made the mistake.</UTT>Babe tried to steal the second base and it didn't work out well.</UTT>It didn't work well at all. I guess the Cubs won the WS back to back didn't work for them either.</UTT>And their win was last until 2016 and it was quite a long layoff.</UTT>The team seems to be really cursed at the top of their game, and the Women's World Cup is higher rated than the World Series.</UTT>The World Cup just comes around every 4 years so I can see how popular it is on TV.</UTT>I guess that makes sense, given that the World Series is really popular in states and women's soccer teams aren't as popular.</UTT>Baseball is not as popular as it was back in the day. Too many things compete with the viewing time.</UTT>I guess it isn't. There's a lot of sport out there. I like the Yankees and the history they have.</UTT>They have the most wins in history by a large margin.</UTT>Have you heard of Bill O'Reilly and his invention of a fake press organization to get season tickets?</UTT>He's a well-known Yankee fan. I didn't put it past him.</UTT>He may find another way to get a ticket by now, and what is interesting about Don Mattingly is how he is suspended.</UTT>They have strict dress and appearance codes for the Yankees. He should get a haircut.</UTT>I'm not fighting the team, I'm just getting them already. Great chat with you today anyway.</UTT>You too. Have a good one.</UTT>1

Hi, you, I guess Rafaele Nadal was forced out of the U.S. Open semis by a knee injury.</UTT>That's really sad. He's such a talented player.</UTT>I know right, Del Port said it was not the best way to win the match, he loved playing against Rafa, he was the biggest fighter in the sport.</UTT>It's never great to have something handed to you at that level. Earning it is more fun so I see his point.</UTT>Yep, I agree. I guess he doesn't like to be taped up typically, his coaches tape it off a few times and tear it off each time. He eventually limps, his speed affects and his knee declines.</UTT>At least he believes he knows what happened to it so he can rehab it faster.</UTT>That's true and a good point. I guess he suffered from tinnitus for a while and is 33.</UTT>He is projected to have a short career too.</UTT>Oh, I really don't know that. He proves people wrong with his work ethic and raw talent. Do you like any other entertainment type?</UTT>I love old school video games, aren't you?</UTT>I love playing nintendo. The system was discontinued in 2003.</UTT>It's sad, that's a classic, that's the best, only 54 colors.</UTT>Things have come so far. It is almost unrecognisable. The entertainment has evolved and can now be adaptable to suit any scale.</UTT>It really has. You know, someone once told you that Reagan didn't look good enough as president.</UTT>What way is that crazy lol? The President isn't crazy enough to wonder who called that? It's bad.</UTT>They certainly don't know what they're talking about.</UTT>I recently watched an old Roger Federer match. He is an amazing tennis player. He was born in 1981 and is the world's number 3 professional tennis player.</UTT>He, Nadal and Djokovic account for 56 percent of the Grand Slam titles.</UTT>That's something else, man. Wait for talent. In 2016 Federal suffered his biggest injury of his career. He stretched too far as he drew a bath for his children and tore his meniscus.</UTT>That's kind of crazy for athletes.</UTT>You just never know when you might have stepped wrong. It's very shocking though. I think it's neat that they used to use helicopters to dry grass at tennis matches.</UTT>I heard kinda nuts about that, good chat anyway.</UTT>1

Hello, do you like basketball?</UTT>Hi, I do. I enjoy watching the Bulls. Do you have a team in your favor?</UTT>I like supersonics in Seattle, but to be honest I'm not too into basketball. I find it interesting though. * Science about it.</UTT>I agree, I would only watch it if it was on TV and it couldn't change channels. I think it was a lot of money that paid better than football. Allen Irving got an op-ed of $800K a year until he was 55.</UTT>Oh wow, I want that kind of money in my life haha 39 of 50 states have the highest paid college football or basketball coaches. Maybe it's time to go into sports for my job.</UTT>I too agree, and when I learn that I think the same thing. Because you like science, physicists prove the best techniques for shooting and scoring.</UTT>Oh really, what's that?</UTT>Hahaha, it's called "grandmotherly style", but NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid.</UTT>Wow, I did it, no shame in it haha, bring it on, you know the Air Jordans were banned when the NBA introduced them.</UTT>Haha, I know right, they wouldn't pay me if it were millions or its potential haha, and I don't know of any short sale offers from Nike to Lebron after Reebok rejected a million dollars. Oh Lordy.</UTT>Wow, his rejection was good, he earned $8 million, I guess Jordan wore Jordan anyway because NIKE was willing to pay a fine each time. I think that worked well for them.</UTT>I know. It's almost like he expected it, but I guess when you're that good it's a good business. If it's not coached, I probably won't reject it. But it makes sense.</UTT>I definitely did not reject the first offer haha I did it ok, not like Tim Duncan who sacrificed money to stay in college instead of going straight to the NBA.</UTT>I know right, that makes this person like Tim Duncan so amazing. A mistake, but then a great choice. I'm glad Lebron is humble and you know he's raised 60 million dollars for charity.</UTT>I don't. I admire people's charitable qualities. Only wish I had the resources to be charitablely able. Wooh, apparently the New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed the tall black team. Pretty crazy. I don't think it's very nice.</UTT>I too. Have you ever watched Space Jam? I was a baby in the 90's so it was a sham.</UTT>I loved that movie as a kid. I heard there might be a sequel, but I'm not sure if it's really happening. Did Lebron do it?</UTT>Apparently Lebron and Warner Bros signed a sequel deal. It would be interesting to see it for sure.</UTT>I absolutely saw it. It reminded me of my childhood. I see why Lebron is often called the best basketball player in the world. He's pretty great.</UTT>agree, well, when i watch a stranger who is too beautiful, well, take care, i send a hug, love, and good vibes, peace</UTT>1

Would you like to watch TV?</UTT>Oh yeah, it's my favorite pastime, I like South Park, you know, I also like Simpsons.</UTT>I like South Park and Simpsons a good place.</UTT>Only one episode of Simpsons mentions or has Bart. They run that show great though.</UTT>Interesting, I don't know why that happened, are actors sick?</UTT>Good question. I don't know. I watched a lot of pokemon episodes with the kids and they have over 750. They have so many that it can run for 16 straight years.</UTT>Wow, that's a lot of episodes, right? Did you watch the 1970's show?</UTT>Hmmmm, I don't watch it very much but I think they have it remade in the UK.</UTT>I heard it failed and it was canceled for 10 episodes. Hmm...</UTT>Oh, crazy, I'd like to visit the UK, the prime minister lives on Downing Street, he has a cat with the official mouse chief title in the cabinet office.</UTT>Interesting, it seems like something they do in the UK.</UTT>The cat has daily duty to look for mice and occupy the house to hunt them, I like Harry Potter books and films, right?</UTT>Interesting. Do you know that if you turn 100 in Japan, you'll get a silver cup to celebrate?</UTT>Cool, I don't know that. I've heard they do a lot of pranks there too. For example, a radio station pranks Queen.</UTT>Did they actually get through?</UTT>They do. They pretend to be Canadian Prime Minister. This happened in 1995 so things could be a lot different now.</UTT>This is so funny, I wonder if they got into trouble?</UTT>I bet somebody knocked on their door at some point. After all, the prime minister heads the cabinet and leads the executive branch of the government. Other cabinet members are elected and can dismiss, and allocate posts to the PM.</UTT>Did you know that the Indonesian President released 3 albums while in office?</UTT>What weird thing does the president do that I wonder how he has time for that I like our system and the job of the president because it doesn't make music.</UTT>He might have been a musician before he got into office. Nice chat with you.</UTT>1

Do you watch football very often?</UTT>I watch pro football. Are you familiar with Kelan Moore?</UTT>No, what am I? Is he a quarterback for the team?</UTT>He's the only left-wing quarterback in the NFL, and he is.</UTT>Oh that's neat, I wonder if that makes for a better quarterback like he's given you as a lefty in baseball?</UTT>Good question. Have you ever heard of Brad Johnson?</UTT>Nope, I don't know many individual players by name, but I probably recognize their pictures. Who is his team to play for?</UTT>He played for the Vikings. He has only thrown a touchdown pass in history.</UTT>How in the world would you throw a touchdown pass to yourself?</UTT>I don't remember how it happened, but I do remember how it happened. I guess it was bobbled and he just happened to be in the right place at the right time.</UTT>Probably. There seems to be a lot of pressure on the British even at high school level.</UTT>Yes definitely, the only two Super Bowl quarterbacks to win were African Americans. That would be surprising if so many players were black.</UTT>They seem to stick white men in the British position. I wonder how much racism is in the team structure, as our society today is in charge of race.</UTT>I also noticed most quarterbacks are white so that's a good question. Do you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's team?</UTT>That's so cool, you think the players are even more evenly distributed wealth, all this popularity, but the owners seem to just line their pockets only to make a pittance, that's how many people endorse the product.</UTT>It seems that endorsements make a lot of money for players. I am very disturbed that the 3 highest paid football coaches for the service branch football team are being paid.</UTT>Hmm, that seems odd. I wonder why.</UTT>I also don't know, but I know the highest paid college coaches who are government employees in many states, so I think we place way too much emphasis on sports.</UTT>What a true story. I would love to see more emphasis on the arts. You can imagine what would happen in the music world if someone like Michael Jackson was only pushed into the sport rather than allowed to sing.</UTT>I feel his father is pushing him whatever he can have. I just recently discovered he didn't invent moonwalks. That's so surprising to me.</UTT>That's surprising, it's so iconic for him, he's a wonderful unique person who has changed the face of music forever.</UTT>1

Have you heard the Sydney Loofe case?</UTT>Unfortunately, Tinder butchers? I guess they got him.</UTT>Odd case. It's terrible how she just wanted to connect with someone and ended up being murdered.</UTT>You can't care to reach out to strangers too. We're good friends of such old. One wrong worm fodder is telephone calls, chats with Snapchat or Facebook frinds.</UTT>It is true, you just can't be sure who is good on the other side of the phone. I wonder if murder is premeditated or just what happened.</UTT>I don't know. I'm creeped out by the death phone call. You know, the dial-up telephone inventors. I heard creepy music playing as I typed that.</UTT>I have no idea. I rarely use my phone for phone calls anymore. The sheer amount of compute power on the iphone kind of blows my mind.</UTT>I blame something on the 1930s actress, Hedy Lamarr, who supposedly had something to do with the cellphone invention.</UTT>She is an amazing genius. I think it's stunning to see how far we are in technology. Can you believe the cable that crosses the oceans just 2.7 inches around for Internet and phone?</UTT>You never dialed the wrong number that turned out to be a dolphin. They apparently could communicate via phone.</UTT>I'm sure they have a lot to say. I think that's what I like. I know the phone is optimized for human voice, but I'm happy to talk to dolphins.</UTT>A fax machine sounds a lot, but those cables have to cross underwater. Sounds like fantasy.</UTT>Indeed, I love fantasy. People do fantasy drafting for everything from national spelling bees to congress and football.</UTT>Fantasy drafts sound like a cold breeze, so your neck hair stands up while watching Lord of the Rings. You know that only Return of the King won the Academy Award.</UTT>I have no idea. That's an excellent movie. Tolkien is sometimes a great writer, but I prefer Terry Pratchett. He's knighted.</UTT>But you can major in Pratchett in college ahh...university where you can major in fantasy by concentrating on Tolkien studies.</UTT>Wow, I can do that really well. It's amazing how fantasy is embraced in so many different media types. It goes from written and spoken words to TV, movies and video games.</UTT>Puppets too. Have you ever watched Jim Henderson's "Dark Crystal"?</UTT>I love it. It has such a vivid universe.</UTT>I was reminded of Hans Christian Anderson's dark tale of spooking your children.</UTT>I wonder if children have a difficult time figuring out what is fantasy or reality. It appears that it all is predicated on one fold in the brain.</UTT>And too many, you are a Tinder butcher, I'll chat with you nicely.</UTT>1

What entertainment do you enjoy?</UTT>A lot. You'd love to go to the museums, movies and name it ii. Have you ever been to DC by chance or visited it, would you like to?</UTT>I only lived in DC once, I don't remember much about it anymore though.</UTT>I got it. I don't remember much of the class trip there. I'll go back with my kids in a year. We all love the Museum of Natural History where they say there are a life-size pack of wolves (stuffed wolves), coyotes, bison, moose, and wolves.</UTT>I agree and remember being impressed. I went there in my youth for a school trip.</UTT>We're talking now. I also went to the Kennedy Center on DC Dream Day because I haven't built my class trip year yet. Do you go to any other special places?</UTT>What is a dream day?</UTT>Just express what you would really like to do on a special day in DC. Any sight or entertainment venue you like can happen. Makes more sense?</UTT>Well, if you have never been to any of the famous government buildings, it's worth going there at least once.</UTT>I agree, I like the free admission, no admission fees, and the place, you can't afford to see the play for say 120 dollars, who suggested you?</UTT>I heard a winter tale played worth watching.</UTT>Shakespeare's comedy has some not so funny bits too, sad I don't budget for a live play ticket anymore, new movies like Incredibles II are more like it, have you seen it?</UTT>I have, and by the way, great movies.</UTT>I haven't seen it yet but I want it. I really like Samuel L. Jackson's job as the voice of the character in the 2004 original movie.</UTT>See the original?</UTT>Yes, also seen kids playing the follow up video game Incredibles.</UTT>Really, remember its name?</UTT>Rise of the Underminers. I sometimes like comedy movies, but not animated films. Do you have a favorite film that makes you laugh?</UTT>I like kung fu hustle or what we do in the shadows.</UTT>You know Bill Murray is in favor of KF Hustle, my favorite comedy is Groundhog Day. Admit it, I watch February 2nd or thereabouts every February and I'm still laughing.</UTT>I like the kungfu hustle, the short history, everything near, Austin's power, and what we're doing in the shadows. I hope you check out some of these and enjoy them. Thanks for the chat.</UTT>1

I believe that handicapped people need such a service dog.</UTT>It helps the veterans and handicapped individuals more depend on each other.</UTT>I agree, Disney Land recently had a field trip for a service dog. Canine companies organized an outing, even giving a dog that Mickey Mouse ate.</UTT>And poor Pluto gets jealous that dogs are allowed to roam freely in Disneyland.</UTT>Ha ha, I believe Disney Land made a very nice gesture about it, I would love to see that. It sounds adorable.</UTT>Sure did. Ever been to the Walden Disney Studios?</UTT>I haven't. It sounds like a good time though. Do you haven't?</UTT>No, but one day I'd like to be in Burbank, California.</UTT>I'm much, much more far away so it's difficult to make it happen. Have you ever watched American Choppers?</UTT>I heard it, but I never watched it because I didn't get Discovery Channel.</UTT>I see. It appears to be returning to popular culture and even a meme featuring shouting between the stars.</UTT>That's interesting, I'd rather have a Disney film than one.</UTT>I do too, but it is difficult to see which memes are most popular if you are in social media. Users use argument scenes to form their own memes, including ridiculous arguments, philosophical debates and more.</UTT>Do you like animation films like the ones produced by Pixar?</UTT>I do. It's not my favorite genre, but I enjoy them from time to time. I like Wall-E.</UTT>My first animated movie was "Bambi". Disney uses special cameras to make it look realistic.</UTT>I really don't realize that. Do you know anything about how it is different? I can't remember my first animated movie.</UTT>Well, the camera is supposed to change the speed and distance of the moving piece, but it's been so long since I watched it to specifically remember it.</UTT>That's very interesting. I recently found out that Wreck-It-Ralph started developing in the late 1980s. I was so shocked by that. I wonder how much rewriting is needed based on the character in it so long after.</UTT>That's interesting. I understand why Walmart Disney Pix is called one of the Big Six of Hollywood.</UTT>Especially recently all they have done is acquire property.</UTT>1

Hi, are you traveling?</UTT>I do for work and business. I usually go always. Wish I had a Dutch-created commuter bus that went 160 mph.</UTT>That sounds pretty interesting. I'd like to try that one.</UTT>They said all Japan's highways had a toll. Traveling across the country would cost more than $300.</UTT>That's pretty expensive but their road is really good so go there.</UTT>They probably put all that money back into the road infrastructure.</UTT>Yeah, there is no rail service in Ireland.</UTT>I wonder how far it is between major cities. Most people fly, but I bet there are plenty who never leave their towns.</UTT>And it is a small country, so flights are probably too short.</UTT>So probably I would love to visit there.</UTT>Yeah, I'm too. Do you know that the King is the first one to travel the world?</UTT>Isn't it King Kalakaua of Hawaii?</UTT>That's him. I suppose it's on a ship.</UTT>So probably. They say most people from Michigan Island travel in horse drawn carriages or on bikes. They have banned motorized vehicles from Michigan for over 100 years.</UTT>That must be a very quiet place for you to enjoy nature.</UTT>I bet it was peaceful and clean. They're probably really healthy there.</UTT>Yeah, have you watched much soccer?</UTT>I don't usually dislike, but I like watching the World Cup.</UTT>Nice. Do you have a favorite team or just watch the game?</UTT>I just watched the game mostly, if it was possible I would like to see USA win.</UTT>Yeah, that's not great, you never know, nice chat.</UTT>1

Do you like the NFL?</UTT>I sure do. Do you know that women can play it as well?</UTT>There is no written rule saying they can't play.</UTT>If they qualify, they'd be good to play like the rest.</UTT>Yeah, after all, it was an average game, only 11 minutes.</UTT>Yeah but we've been glued to TV forever for games.</UTT>Yeah, engineers make more for a lifetime than football players.</UTT>They also have longer careers so that could help them there.</UTT>Good true point. Did you hear that rule for Saints cheerleaders?</UTT>They are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players.</UTT>And if they walk somewhere they have to leave mid meal.</UTT>It's sexist and needs to go really.</UTT>I agree, do you like Brady at all?</UTT>I do. Do you know he was a back up quarterback in high school?</UTT>And despite the team's really poor performance, he never started.</UTT>I guess they lost. Do you know that Alex Smith finished college 2 years later?</UTT>He took a lot of aptitude tests in high school and really planned them.</UTT>And he started his masters before he even got picked for the draft.</UTT>Yeah, you know who invented the circular huddle?</UTT>Paul Hubbard is deaf and doesn't want to be understood by other teams.</UTT>That's very smart of him.

Are you interested in FIFA World Cup soccer?</UTT>Hi there, I'm watching the World Cup, do you know where it will be in 2022?</UTT>I heard the finals in Qatar but FIFA has not yet existed in Qatar.</UTT>It's interesting that they don't even have a city for the Cup, they can build an entire city for the Cup.</UTT>Indeed, it is strange. Build it and they will come. I don't know if the U.S. was placed third in the first FIFA World Cup game in 1930. I can't believe it went back that far.</UTT>It sure goes back to time. The US women's team seem to be doing better because they never placed under third place.</UTT>Yep. Do you know soccer is varied with 3 teams playing at the same time?</UTT>I'd actually like to see how those games are played. I'm curious.</UTT>That was entertaining. I heard that the NES could only display 54 colors.</UTT>I love Nignendo, too bad it was discontinued in Japan in 2003.</UTT>Life is a part of disappointment, as Ronald Reagan was rejected for a movie role because he didn't have the look of a president.</UTT>hahahahahahahaha he proved them wrong by becoming a real president, figure out what he is good at though.</UTT>Funny how Bill Nye got started on the entertainment by winning a similar contest with Steve Martin.</UTT>Hahaha that's actually very funny, the guy is now a legend.</UTT>Caesar is a legend too. He once visited Britain and was surprised that people breed chickens for entertainment and not for food.</UTT>Figure out what he thinks of them. Back, have you heard of all the German soccer players who donated to win the World Cup?</UTT>Mesut Ozil made it possible for 23 Brazilian kids to get the surgery they need.</UTT>How heartwarming. He's a good guy even Jon Steward plays soccer and represents the US.</UTT>Yeah, I was surprised to learn that the term soccer is slang, which means Association Football.</UTT>Yeah, that's not what you're thinking, either.

Build it and they will come. I don't know if the U.S. was placed third in the first FIFA World Cup game in 1930. I can't believe it went back that far.</UTT>It sure goes back to time. The US women's team seem to be doing better, never placing themselves under third place. It's odd that they don't owe a city for the Cup, and they can destroy entire cities for it.</UTT>Yep. Do you know soccer is varied with 3 teams playing at the same time?</UTT>I'd actually like to see how those games are played. I'm curious.</UTT>That was entertaining. I heard that the NES could only display 54 colors.</UTT>I love Nignendo, too bad it was discontinued in Japan in 2003.</UTT>Life is a part of disappointment, as Ronald Reagan was rejected for a movie role because he didn't have the look of a president.</UTT>hahahahahahahaha he proved them wrong by becoming a real president, figure out what he is good at though.</UTT>Funny how Bill Nye got started on the entertainment by winning a similar contest with Steve Martin.</UTT>They are actually very funny, woman, now that the guy is a legend.</UTT>Caesar is a legend too. He once visited Britain and was surprised that people breed chickens for entertainment and not for food.</UTT>Figure too. I know what he rejected of the country. Back, have you heard of even German breeders who donated all their winnings to the World Cup?</UTT>Mesut Ozil made it possible for 23 Brazilian kids to get the surgery they need.</UTT>How heartwarming. He's a good guy even Jon Steward plays soccer and represents the US.</UTT>Yeah, I was surprised to learn that the term soccer is slang, which means Association Football.</UTT>Yeah, that's not what you're thinking, either. They're the richest players in the world though.</UTT>Yep, you are an excellent chat partner. Thanks, I'm.</UTT>0
Hi, do you know much about the President?</UTT>I think I learn more every day. I respect the presidency's office. I visited the White House and noticed how large the guest house seemed. I looked far away, though.</UTT>That's strange, they could just get a lot of guests.</UTT>Hmm, that's a sure observation. I'm fascinated by JFK, Washington and Jefferson, the wealthiest presidents. Do you know anything about the presidency?</UTT>I know Indonesian President is a pop artist.</UTT>Oh really, sure how stange, the first Zimbabwean president had the nickname Banana, what a hoot, I don't know how the president takes him seriously, it reminds me of a kid song.</UTT>The guys from them are going on and on about releasing 3 albums.</UTT>The album release was weird. The U.S. used to have some interesting procedure for electing Presidents. Until 1805, when it changed and became the way it is today, the vice president was automatically elected.</UTT>Yeah, I'm glad it changed if I can't see Trump and Clinton working for each other.</UTT>That isn't a good match in fact, I totally agree with you on that.</UTT>Do you use your computer much?</UTT>I use it all the time, and I use programs all the time too. I use my microwave every day because the computer controls it. I look at the computer in my house every day. Robots and their design aids are in most electronic.</UTT>That is very true. Do you know that Apple will void the warranty if you smoke near their computers?</UTT>Hmm, I've never heard that. That must be in a small print. Smoking has to be a sort of biohazard.</UTT>Yeah, I think that's the reason too, but I've not heard that before either.</UTT>Pretty interesting, sure. I truly learned that someone built a working computer with 16 bits using nothing but basic minecraft building blocks. Also, the Russians built a water-running computer long ago, 1936. Computer building is a race.</UTT>And it still seems to be. Do you listen to his radio much?</UTT>I often listen to websites that have thousands of free episodes of classic radio dramas. I appreciate the website offering it for free.</UTT>Yeah, that's really nice of me too. You can also catch the Jupiter storm on the radio.</UTT>I have enjoyed that recently. Wish I could understand the latin channel. Since 1989 Finnish radio stations have broadcast nuntii latini music.</UTT>That's amazing how many listeners they have. Nice chat.</UTT>1

Hello there, have you attended many music concerts?</UTT>I do, and prefer live concerts over not live.</UTT>Yeah, same here. I used to go quite a bit, but not so much these days. Who is your favorite concert ever?</UTT>I like Pink floyd. It appears they recorded live concerts in a Roman amphitheater in Powellii without an audience.</UTT>I'm a fan too, but mostly of their first albums. I've seen some footage. It looks so cool.</UTT>Interesting, the creed appears well so terrible that it is sueabled against people who attended their concert.</UTT>I read that as well, I think that's pretty sad. If you don't like it next time, don't buy a ticket.</UTT>Well, in Croatia, there is a Roman amphitheater still used today.</UTT>I think that's so cool and would love to see someone play in that venue.</UTT>Yeah, it's cool to see it. Do you know that 1886 was regarded as the year that modern cars were born?</UTT>I thought I'd read that before. Is it a German inventor as well?</UTT>I honestly believe it was Karl Benz. Pretty cool.</UTT>Good call, yeah, very cool. And then, with Mr. Ford, the car became mass produced and widely available years later.</UTT>It is apparently legal in South Africa to put a flamethrower in your car.</UTT>That sounds like a better version of Grand theft auto or Twister Metal than real life.</UTT>Yeah, pretty crazy. Do you like U2?</UTT>They're pretty good, and I'd say their stuff is probably the best early.. what?</UTT>Yeah, I like a few of the first albums, but I admit I haven't listened to them in a long time.</UTT>Oh yeah, I've not heard that album forever, and I know my older brother likes it as well.</UTT>They apparently played country music in Texas once, wearing wigs.</UTT>Probably the best thing I've ever heard of them. Nice chat and hope you have a good day.</UTT>1

They appeared without an audience at a Roman amphitheater in Powellii to have eight live concerts.</UTT>I thought I'd read that before.

Hello, my friend knows who are our richest presidents?</UTT>Hello, I don't know, maybe Tump, Obama, Clinton.</UTT>Well JFK Jefferson and Washington appear and have to take into account inflation.</UTT>Or they may just have a lot of land. Trump may also hide certain aspects of his actual wealth.</UTT>That's true. I think he has to like the Indonesian president and make some pop albums. Haha.</UTT>LOL, that could help him reach third place, he could get to first place if he liked 12 of them while in office.</UTT>Haha good point. He can record with Kyanye and do it in a bigger guest house than a white one.</UTT>He sure could have hit. I bet it would have hit. Everybody watches it no matter how bad it is. I know it could have hit in the century.</UTT>Haha, it can be amazing. Have you heard Zimbabwe's president literally called Banana?</UTT>Really bananas, that's an interesting name.</UTT>It sounds like it. Did you hear they changed the president's rule back in 1805?</UTT>I didn't. Back in 1805 things were different.</UTT>The finished person has become President. Right now imagine Hillary as President and the drama that comes with that.</UTT>We have civil wars in the White House every day, sure fact lol, combined with a bad war.</UTT>Nope at all. I can only see us coming together as a country if they both work together and do pop albums like Indonesia Pres.</UTT>Sure they could work on a hit country album, are you considered a republican?</UTT>I really don't fit into any political party, do I?</UTT>I'm not a democrat more, but I don't really care much either. You know in interest that every bearded US president is a republican.</UTT>That's interesting, and it's been pretty long since the democrats or republicans have been president.</UTT>I guess other parties don't have the influence or power that democrats and republicans do and only the blue and red color seems to matter.</UTT>I guess it's weird they started using only blue and red in 2000, they seem to use them always throughout my lifetime.</UTT>19 years, but seems longer than that. You know Tuman visited Disneyland and rejected Dumbo. I bet the poor little elephant felt bad after that.</UTT>haah poor dumbo, he doesn't want to be associated with the elephant, the republicans, and Trump can't take a picture of Eeyore?</UTT>Poor Dumbo doesn't even know (laughs out) and I bet Trump doesn't.</UTT>I don't think so. If the Democrats want to beat him, they should run for basketball players. Taller people win 75%.</UTT>1

Hi, do you like basketball?</UTT>I'm a very big fan. What about you?</UTT>I definitely don't follow it, but I like the Warriors so I'll try and watch it while they play.</UTT>They are a great team. I like Duncan from the Spurs in my speech of a great team.</UTT>Yeah he hasn't retired recently, he's been playing forever since high school.</UTT>He did, in a very rare move, sacrifice money for his teammates during the game to stay.</UTT>You mean he sacrificed money to stay with his teammates?</UTT>The amount of money a team can spend on players is limited and he is worth a lot of money but he doesn't demand it.</UTT>Oh, I see. That's very nice of him. He also stayed in college for 4 years instead of straight into the NBA.</UTT>I personally don't agree with that one though.</UTT>Oh, really, why not?</UTT>It's off topic, but I think college basketball and football are fine tuned machines to make money for schools and not pay money for athletes who risk their health and well being.</UTT>Right, do you know New Zealand has a team called the Tall Blacks?</UTT>I do, and that sort of seems insensitive these days.</UTT>Yeah, really weird.</UTT>I find it interesting that the coach who lost the most in U of K history was the inventor of basketball and talk about the dominance running.</UTT>I know right that's kinda weird, it may be true, you can't teach.</UTT>That's true, sometimes you just get too good, like Kareem got a dunk ban in college basketball.</UTT>Yeah, that's kind of messed up, but I guess even the playing field is where it is.</UTT>I suppose so, but some may see it as neutralizing skills.</UTT>I've read some fun facts about humans recently. Do you know that we can regrow ribs that have been surgically removed?</UTT>I know that, and it's very interesting that it only takes a few months as well.</UTT>Well, good chat!</UTT>1

Hi, many facts about the earth?</UTT>Earth is the third planet from the sun.</UTT>Yes, the Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. It's been a long time now.</UTT>ii) It is the only known astronomical object harboring life.</UTT>It is. About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered in water.</UTT>The remaining 29 percent are land consisting of continents and islands.</UTT>Yes, the majority of the Earth's polar regions are covered by ice. I think the pack of ice has shrinked in recent years.</UTT>Yes, sad, the Earth will be helium free in the near future. Just like that.</UTT>Indeed, sad, another fact: more than 80 percent of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.</UTT>We have changed the Earth so much in our short time. But you know that if it was a 24 hour period, we would only account for 17 minutes.</UTT>That makes me feel like a tiny ant. Only 5.5 hours when the Earth first formed.</UTT>I wish the work day would go by fast. A lot more days though. I like our 365 days.</UTT>Yes, that's nice, isn't it? Do you know much about Mars?</UTT>ii) It is the second smallest planet in the solar system.</UTT>Interesting. The sound on Mars has a higher pitch than on Earth because of the different atmospheres.</UTT>All our helium could end up like that.</UTT>The creation of a reality TV show will loudly fund a project planned for 2023 to colonize Mars.</UTT>I hope it is more interesting than the reality TV show now. neat to see space stuff.</UTT>It's iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</UTT>A flight to Mars could only take a day or two if it was constantly accelerated by a gram.</UTT>I'm on a trip, I have to run. Have a great day.</UTT>1

Hello, do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>I do. I learn Latin. And there is a Finnish station that broadcasts a latini program every week.</UTT>Oh nice, I didn't really speak about it. I wonder how many listeners they have.</UTT>I'm curious as well, I wonder who's listening to the jupiter wave radio waves.</UTT>I guess you can catch that on the radio?</UTT>Crazy how simple it is to make a radio. In WW2 soldiers could make a radio using pencils and razorblades.</UTT>Yeah, they call that Foxhole Radio.</UTT>Do you have any pets fish?</UTT>I actually do small aquariums, but I don't have any neck fish.</UTT>I was surprised that seahorses were only fish with necks.</UTT>Yeah, I don't even know they are fish.</UTT>Do you know that only saltwater fish drink water?</UTT>The freshwater ones get it through their skin by osmosis.</UTT>I wonder how it feels like an immortal jelly fish.</UTT>I wonder about that too. Do you know we are closely associated with zebrafish?</UTT>Yeah, we share 84 percent of our genes, which is pretty crazy.</UTT>I guess that's why so many studies of those fishes are going on there.</UTT>Do you own a phone?</UTT>I do smartphones, not that rotary phone.</UTT>The New York area code is used because the 212 is dialed the fastest by rotary.</UTT>That makes sense, I'll chat to you nicely.</UTT>1

Hi, do you like cars?</UTT>You know, I don't know why the trunk of a car is called a trunk because the old car has a wood trunk on the back.</UTT>That's pretty cool, do you know how Cameron gets it?</UTT>It's crazy that flame throwers are allowed into South African cars to prevent the carjacking.</UTT>I know, pretty insane. Cameron got their name from the guy who founded Detroit and last had Cameron.</UTT>What is your first car? My first was an ugly green Ford Torino with white vinyl tops. It uses more oil than gas.</UTT>Wow, that sounds old. I have a small Nissan. Do you know how the drive thru came about?</UTT>Wow, the earth will be virtually helium free by the 21st century, I don't know, I guess I'm not crazy talking because I breathe helium balloons.</UTT>Hahaha I guess not. But it's sad that we've destroyed so much of the forest on earth.</UTT>How is that possible? I'm not so sure I believe that.</UTT>I'm not surprised, but there sure seems to be a lot. Do you know that the day is only 5.5 hours when the earth was formed?</UTT>That makes for a short work day ah a good old day.</UTT>That's just too short. Do you believe in extraterrestrials?</UTT>I'm hard pressed to believe there's nothing or nobody out there. The quote from the movie "Contact" seems like a big waste of space.</UTT>Yeah, it is indeed a big space. If they contact us, the UN will appoint an ambassador to deal with them.</UTT>How does one qualify for that position? Do you think other ambassadors would laugh at these people behind the back?</UTT>I have no idea how that really works do you like playing chess?</UTT>I used to play when I was younger.</UTT>Nice. There are less atoms in the universe than chess moves.</UTT>I read that correctly about the study in 2007. Is lower IQ correlated with better chess skills?</UTT>Seems that way. The brain is too interested.</UTT>1

Good evening, I think dancing is such a beautiful form of human movement, do you like dancing?</UTT>Hello, I like dancing, but I know I'm not very good. I think dancers are so impressive.</UTT>It was so fun to watch them. Michael Jackson especially. He has a device patented for lean movement.</UTT>I think I'll hear that very interesting. In his prime he was the King of Dance moves, in my opinion.</UTT>I agree 100%. A ballet dancer can go through 4 shoes a week.</UTT>That's crazy, I wonder how their feet look, the most likely pretty rough.</UTT>So much stress they have to take. I think cute babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.</UTT>That's funny, and I wonder if it started when they were still in the womb.</UTT>Good question. Pac did dance too and did ballet in high school.</UTT>I thought I'd heard that, it sounds pretty cool to me, and I wonder if there is a youtube video on that out there?</UTT>I should check with you. He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.</UTT>That's awesome, I'm sure he's proud of his past as a mouse king lol.</UTT>Haha yes he is. Bruce Lee is still more surprised than Tupac, but also a famous dancer.</UTT>Yeah, more is sure to be expected. He really can move around effortlessly in his movies.</UTT>He's so quick and agile, I'd love to get a selfie with him on my iphone. The first generation phones were released in 2007 and I still remember that moment.</UTT>I think you are right. I remember when they did it. After 10 years I knew the app store had over 2 million apps.</UTT>Amazing evolution, do you know that women are more likely to own iphones than men?</UTT>I've never heard that fact, very odd. Do you use an iPhone?</UTT>I did, and Ii was a man so I guess Ii broke that sterotype. I've never played an iphone game to send it to heaven, but that can explain why my iphone is still intact (lol).</UTT>That's way funny. I wonder how many people played that game destroyed their phones.</UTT>I think it's a good thing Apple banned it lol app creators seem to want to create havoc I hope you have a good rest of your evening</UTT>Same here sounds pretty dumb and waste. Thanks for the same.</UTT>1
Good evening, I think dancing is such a beautiful form of human movement, do you like dancing?</UTT>Hello, I like dancing, but I know I'm not very good. I think dancers are so impressive.</UTT>It was so fun to watch them. Michael Jackson especially. He has a device patented for lean movement.</UTT>I think I'll hear that very interesting. In his prime he was the King of Dance moves, in my opinion.</UTT>I agree 100%. A ballet dancer can go through 4 shoes a week.</UTT>That's crazy, I wonder how their feet look, the most likely pretty rough.</UTT>So much stress they have to take. I think cute babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.</UTT>That's funny, and I wonder if it started when they were still in the womb.</UTT>The question heard was: "Tupac still dances and dances things in high school."</UTT>I thought I'd heard that, it sounds pretty cool to me, and I wonder if there is a youtube video on that out there?</UTT>I should check with you. He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.</UTT>That's awesome, I'm sure he's proud of his past as a mouse king lol.</UTT>Haha yes he is.

The first generation phones were released in 2007 and I still remember that moment.</UTT>I think you are right. I remember when they were good. After 10 years I was quick to say that there was still over 2 million because of how much I was.</UTT>Amazing evolution, do you know that women are more likely to own iphones than men?</UTT>I've never heard that fact, very odd.

Hi, who are you?</UTT>I've been thinking about birds a lot lately. Do you know anything about their anatomy?</UTT>I really don't know much about birds. I hear they have hollow bones.</UTT>True, I read their high metabolic rate and 4 chambered hearts.</UTT>I am amazed that birds can fly from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping. I guess their brains must not require sleep.</UTT>They are really amazing, some wild birds in Australia can mimic cameras, car alarms and chainsaws.</UTT>I am amazed that their vocal cords can do what machines do. Hummingbirds use spider webs to build nests.</UTT>Well, anything that could evolve from pigeons to dodo birds must be very adaptable.</UTT>I guess every species needs to evolve and adapt. Humans do so as well. They have lost their body hair or most of their hair relatively recently.</UTT>True, if the government of an organized community works, the human needs to be mentally and physically versatile.</UTT>True, consider the guy in France who sells the Eiffel Tower twice impersonating a government official.</UTT>That's nuts. The US government can actually sell Nevada because it owns nearly 90% of the states.</UTT>I think they control most of it for military purposes and such. Just like Norway did they could sell the land and donate proceeds to help save the Amazon rainforest.</UTT>I think it might have something to do with their immunity from violating Geneva.</UTT>They probably need that immunization now because Wikileaks tells a lot of government secrets.</UTT>True, I heard that Wikileaks published a government plan to destroy it.</UTT>I wonder how the government could destroy Wikileaks, which probably has a lot of backup and hiding sites.</UTT>They could use one of the best distance runners, the human.</UTT>We are very good at spreading out into a new environment. But we still can't synthesize C.</UTT>Evolution sometimes results in things like defective enzymes.</UTT>Well, I enjoyed a chat with you, make sure you get plenty of vitamin C.</UTT>Thank you, stay away from the frequency of human fear.</UTT>1

Hey, what do you think of Hope Hicks? She recently met with President Trump.</UTT>I honestly don't remember a lot about her as she left the administration a while back. I know she met with an investigator into Russian interference in elections while she was there.</UTT>I remember that too. I guess Mike Rogers said in an interesting way that Trump didn't tell his department to mess with the Russia investigation.</UTT>That is very interesting and concerning. Do you know a lot of president trivia?</UTT>I know some things about it, like the richest presidents, Jefferson, Washington, and also JFK.</UTT>That is very interesting. You also know that guest houses are larger than white houses. I wonder why they did that.</UTT>That doesn't make any sense. Also, the fact that Indonesian President has released 3 pop albums doesn't make any sense. Think about what he has to do that is more important.</UTT>I heard he did that while in office. That makes it stranger than it was before or after.</UTT>Yep it is very strange. Also strange is our old system has the president become the vice president and the runner up elected. Talk about the weird.</UTT>Wow, can you imagine that now?</UTT>LOL, that's so much crazy and drama for Vice President Clinton and President Trump.</UTT>I agree. Now we are far too partisan for that. Have you ever heard of Zimbabwe calling the first president?</UTT>I think they call him bananas, lol, I wonder if he wants a fair and square election or if he uses bananas for his election?</UTT>Ha, what a strange name, do you know a lot about elections?</UTT>I know a little bit about elections, and you know that in 2012 international election observers were blocked from visiting the polls in 9 of them.</UTT>What, that is unacceptable, I wonder how that is justified?</UTT>Yeah, I don't know why they aren't admitted, and what do you think the taller candidate would win the 75% election for President?</UTT>I don't, but would be interested to see a study on that reasoning. Do we subconsciously gravitate towards taller people?</UTT>I think so, it must be built on our genes, and when you vote, do you think that Nevada will let you choose the option to vote for none of these candidates?</UTT>That seems strange. People can't just leave it blank if they want, like they do everywhere else.</UTT>Yep, we just don't vote at all. I think it's very silly, but I'm interested in it last time. It's sad that the maximum turnout in the United States is about 63%?</UTT>Very sad. I can't imagine why people wouldn't take it more seriously. Many of them usually have opinions but don't want to go out and do anything about it.</UTT>1

Hello there, like the music?</UTT>Hi there, I like music, I like most everything except country, what about you?</UTT>Nice, I like everything a little bit too. Do you like rape a lot and listen to it?</UTT>I listen to rap sometimes. I'm not for it, but they have some good songs. What about you? I know a lot of people like Tupac.</UTT>I like Pac and his music in the Congress library.</UTT>Yep that's impressive. It appears to be there because of cultural significance. Do you like the "Busta Rhymes" music?</UTT>I like him too. He's the voice of the reptar wagon in the Ratrats.</UTT>Haha yes he did. I had to watch that movie again lol. Have you ever heard of a compliment battle?</UTT>Yeah, they practice complimenting each other in South Korea.</UTT>Yep, you're right, you've heard of the Michigan judge who gave Eminem the ruling, rape him. She had too much time on her hands lol.</UTT>Haha I agree there, wonder if people think it's a joke, like Eminem?</UTT>Haha he's okay. I don't think his new stuff is very good, but I listened to him back in high school haha. What do you do for entertainment?</UTT>He originally wanted to be a comic book artist so I wondered how they could go. Would you like to play video games?</UTT>I like playing video games. I played NES back in the day. We call it NES. It appears to only display 54 colors, do you know?</UTT>Interesting, I don't know that. Too bad it was discontinued in Japan in 2003.</UTT>Yep, I agree with you, I'm just glad we live in the present day where we have access to video games, and we didn't live in the 1950s when people used chickens for entertainment (lol).</UTT>Yeah, I wonder what Ceasar thought of that when he visited there and came upon this.</UTT>hahaha he probably thinks they are crazy - you heard of science guy Bill Nye - he started an entertainment business doing a lookalike contest with Steve Martin and I think he won.</UTT>That's crazy, but I like the guy a lot. Even Reagan wanted to be an actor when he auditioned for a presidential role and he didn't get it.</UTT>Haha that's funny, I think they told him he didn't have that look of being president, they were so wrong.</UTT>Hahaha, at least he's become a real president, nice chat with you.</UTT>1

I just heard of the onion variety Sunions recently that is untorn. Are you?</UTT>I have no. I guess that must have been an important advance for mankind. Who created them?</UTT>Bayer Crop Science, Ohio State University. They appear to be hybrids and GMO modified root crops. That must make Ant GMO happy.</UTT>Most of our food is modified one way or another. Untried onions don't sound that bad though.</UTT>Hybridization has been going on for centuries. GMOs are relatively new. I find the cry-causing compound syn-propanethial-S-oxide interesting in the eating defense mechanism. I don't think plants can evolve that way, as I do almost in my mind.</UTT>I suppose there is risk, but people don't eat food like they have for centuries in nature. I don't worry about genetics.</UTT>Sometimes GM organisms and hybrids have unintended consequences. I support heritage seed banks at our local university and let them have research plots on our land for the growth/re-establishment of the prairie ecosystem (oil also appears to have no after taste). That change is that the growing of onions is a GM genus.</UTT>I guess the non-generic onion is useful in some businesses products. I think preserving the seed is good because it contains information.</UTT>I agree, I must see if my feed store can get my onion seed. They grow onion in Washington and Nevada, but I'm not sure how to grow onion in Louisiana, but it's worth trying. If I can't get onion seed, I can find it on the internet.</UTT>I do some internet shopping. Sometimes I go to Amazon if I can't find something elsewhere or need it in a hurry?</UTT>It is 40 miles from the big city. I support my local feed, seed, butcher, grocery store etc. If I can't find it locally, I buy online before driving 40 miles. If the cost of driving in the city is added to the cost of the item, it isn't worth it.</UTT>I haven't read their terms, I figure if they can make money off of browsing data they will sell and purchase it.</UTT>Only 7% of people seem to read the term when they buy online. That's why I stick to Amazon and a select few venders. Even in rural areas the internet can change life, but it can also be
