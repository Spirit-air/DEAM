I saw that Bryce Harper is inline to make a ton of money, almost getting close to Alex Rodriguez.</UTT>Best news for him since those stupid "Make Baseball Fun Again" hats.</UTT>I remember when A-Rod was signing up, he go almost over $275 million in one year. Unreal</UTT>And now he's made $440 million altogether - so far. I wonder what he does with the bulk of his wealth?</UTT>I think some of these players spend a lot of their money relatively quickly. I'm not sure that Harper is worth it. I watch a lot of Nationals games.</UTT>How do you feel about Rendon getting let go from the team, then?</UTT>The negotiation with him went on for a long time if I remember correctly.</UTT>I'm a huge Yankees fan myself. Didn't know that the stadium was apparently good for left-handed people.</UTT>I've heard that. I've also heard the same thing about Boston's stadium.</UTT>Did A-Rod ever play for Boston? I forget...I know he bounced around earlier in his career,</UTT>I don't think he did to be honest. Harper had a terrible year last year, I think his average was around 250, which is really low.</UTT>Just like Washington Nationals fan to know that! Apparently, they (you) are very knowledgeable.</UTT>I didn't know that in Japan baseball could potentially be more popular than in the US.</UTT>I think they're the only nation that have better players than the U.S. Imagine if we had a real WORLD series?</UTT>That would be pretty interesting, also interesting is that managers of baseball teams can technically play for their team if the need arises.</UTT>I wonder if that's ever happened? Maybe when Sandy Koufax refused to pitch on Yom Kippur!</UTT>That's a name I have not heard for a long time. I think he played for both NY and LA.</UTT>Speaking of old players, if either of us had saved cards from back then (and been alive back then), we couldn't racked up 3 million dollars, like some guy did when he found a bunch of baseball cards from the early 20th century!</UTT>Crazy, baseball cards hold there value for some of the really older ones. Nowadays, I'm not so sure though.</UTT>I think rare Pokemon cards might be worth more in these days.</UTT>That's probably true, they publish way too many baseball cards now.</UTT>1

hey there my friend do you drive cars?</UTT>I do drive a car. Do you?</UTT>yes I have a jetta, do you ever go through the drive through?</UTT>I do. Do you?</UTT>yes I do, did you hear the history of the drive through</UTT>I have not. Do you know it?</UTT>ya, mcdonald's invented it actually, they made it for the soldiers in uniforms</UTT>Wow that was nice of them. I wonder when the trunk came into existence?</UTT>ya I don't know, but it sounds like a fire hazard to have a wooden trunk on a car back in the day</UTT>Plus if you had a flame thrower on your car, it was a recipe for disaster!</UTT>or a recipe for fun, depends on your perspective haha!</UTT>I read a story in maxim years ago about that and they also had huge swords that would cut the carjackers legs off. What would be the worse way to go?</UTT>haha well I think either way that sounds horrible, probably burning would be worse for me, what do you think</UTT>I think burning too. I can still function with no legs but to lose all my nerve ending and have months of rehab would be awful.</UTT>yup, plus I have seen burn victims and their faces and skin always make me sad</UTT>Did you know NYC's area code is 212 because it is the easiet to dial.</UTT>Haha I did, yes 212 is the fastest number you can dial on a rotary phone!</UTT>Did you ever have a rotary phone?</UTT>haha I've played with one, I only have a cell phone right now, what about you</UTT>Me too. I had a rotary growing up and it was the worst when you misdialed and had to start over or your finger slipped...</UTT>haha sounds horrible! what do you think of fish? I like to eat them</UTT>They are delicious smoked. Nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

Hello!  Do you use the internet a lot?</UTT>All the time!  How about you?</UTT>Same here.  I think I'm connected almost constantly when I'm home.  Did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button?  lol  I never knew that.</UTT>Me neither, my colleagues would refer to it as that.  I always just called it the menu button.</UTT>lol  Me too.  There is 3g cell service and internet capabilities at the peak of Mt. Everest.  That's amazing.</UTT>You know, so you can check in and Facebook your accomplishment.  LOL</UTT>lol That's funny!  Only 7 percent of people read the full terms when buying a product or service online.  Do you read the full terms?  I go over them but it looks like I'm in the minority.</UTT>I vaguely do, so Ive probably agreed to some sketchy stuff not even knowing it.</UTT>lol Did you know that the space shuttles general purpose computer only ran on 1mb of RAM.  Crazy.</UTT>Wow.  I think about what we have in the things we use for looking at pictures of cats and then something that important.  Crazy.</UTT>I know right?  lol  In 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran on water.  I didn't even know computers were around that early.</UTT>Neither did I , i wonder how powerful it was.</UTT>Not sure.  But it's an interesting concept.  Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks.  They must have been bored. lol</UTT>Really, that sounds like a lot of work.</UTT>I know.  lol  Technology has come such a long way that an iphone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent.  That's amazing and kind of scary at the same time.</UTT>It really is, I remember going to school and teachers saying we wouldnt have a calculator in our pocket everywhere we went....  looks like they were wrong.</UTT>LOL  You're right!  I remember my Texas Instruments calculator now that you mention it.  I thought that thing was so high tech and now it's worthless.  lol  On the subject of phones...Unicef has a program where they will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone.  I'm going to have to look more into that.</UTT>Same here, I could definitely put it down to help out a good cause.</UTT>Same here and seems like an easy cause to contribute to.  I don't use my phone that much.  A little early history on the rotary phone reveals that New York's area code was/is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.  Wonder why they didn't pick 121?</UTT>Or 111?  and why wasnt it given to the emergency department?</UTT>Good point!  I sure wouldn't have wanted to be the one who had to lay the phone and internet cables across the Oceans.  That had to have been one heck of a job.</UTT>I know that is a long way even if they are only 2.7 inches thick..   Its been nice chatting.  Have a good day!</UTT>1

Hello.  Do you remember the news story about a false missile alert in Hawaii last January?</UTT>Yeah that was crazy. The phone alert. And it specifically said it wasn't a drill-wow!</UTT>That was crazy!!  You would think that the government would have some redundancy in the system so that one person could trigger an alarm.  How do you respond?  Is the missile nuclear?  That is an egregious and unforgivable mistake!</UTT>Seriously! I would be so scared. I tink it's great to have a government to warn us of these things but it really shows anyone can make mistakes.</UTT>Again something that serious needs a fail-safe, like a 2-key system to activate in which the government officials are needed to activate.  Once that alarm is sent across the telephone, you can't take it back!  Following up with an "oops" message would lead to more chaos.  Government has its purpose, but often the bureaucracy trips over its own feet.  An then there are those who fake being government reps in scams!</UTT>Yeah good point. Do you think the government should have less control than it has now? The US government owns 86% of land in Nevada, I never knew that.</UTT>I knew that, but a lot of it is for military training and also contains uranium ore.  Outside of Las Vegas and Reno, the population is pretty sparse and scattered.   What do you think of WikiLeaks and its philosophy of exposing government secrets?</UTT>I think it was good and bad. The government obviously needs to keep certain information classified but other times they should be more transparent. I think wikileaks was a big gut check for the government to show them the importance of telling the truth and protecting classified info more carefully. The internet is a crazy thing.</UTT>Well, someone apparently leaked to WikiLeaks the government's plans to destroy WikiLeaks?  Hilarious.  I agree some things, mainly sensitive and strategic need to be classified, but I think it is abused too much for political purposes.  With the internet these days, once something is leaked, there is no pulling it back.</UTT>Exactly. The internet is even powerful enough to cause addiction that is measurable in the brain.</UTT>I got rid of my landline phone and go with cellular for personal / business and internet phone as my "office" phone or a psuedo landline.  So, no matter where I am, I am able to get calls and faxed on my internet phone number on my laptop.  Do you still use a traditional landline phone service?</UTT>Good idea! I do not. It's outdated and I only got soliciters calling me. No reason to have one anymore.  Especially since an iphone has more computing power than an entire nuclear icbm deterrent.</UTT>With a smartphone, you can do almost any common computer task.  I still use my laptop a lot because I have fat fingers and could never write a report on my smartphone even though it has the capabilities.  I like the way a smartphone can be turned into an internet hub.  That way, with my laptop, my office is anywhere.</UTT>haha. The phones are getting bigger and bigger though. Yeah that's a good point. The internet is everywhere now. And luckily the library of alexandria has saved a copy of the internet just in case.</UTT>Even Mt Everest has cell telephone and internet in case you want to send a selfie from the peak!!!  Do you do much shopping on the internet?</UTT>That would be epic. I shop on the internet quite often, much more convenient than having to go in the store. When buying stuff online I hate how they have that long page of terms and service. Apparently only 7% of people actually read them.</UTT>Because the terms can vary from vendor to vendor, I stick to a few sites I trust rather than buy from anyone on the internet with the best price.  Use to, you could shop on the internet tax-free.  Those days are gone with Amazon and others collecting sales taxes online.  Some of the things the government waste our tax dollars on are ridiculous, like a study of shrimp on a treadmill!!!  Yet, every now and then they do something good like Norway donating 1 billion to save the Amazon rainforest.</UTT>Yea it seems like every week research is contradicting itself. But one thing we should all agree on is saving the environment like Norway. That is so amazing. The government needs to focus more resources on that for sure.</UTT>Even nonprofits are challenging us to do more.  Did you know UNICEF has a program where they donate a day of clean water for every minute you don't use your cell phone?  I wonder how they figure that out?</UTT>Yeah that is also a great initiative. I think that is a positive note to end on! It was great talking with you have a great day!</UTT>Same to you, and I hope the government wises up and develops a more bulletproof plan to control the alerts they send to our phones and the internet so we do not have another HI scare, at least in my lifetime!</UTT>1

Do you watch Daredevil?</UTT>I have seen it on Netflix, but haven't watched it, have you?</UTT>No, I haven't. I'm not really into superhero series. Though I thought Jessica Jones was okay.</UTT>I'm not either, I watched a few of the movies only because my husband wanted to. I see that Marvel comics created a superhero for a little 4 year old boy, the superhero "Blue Ear", because of the boy being uncomfortable to wear hearing aids, that was nice.</UTT>That is nice. Daredevil is on its third season so a lot of people must like it.</UTT>Yep, also Netflix accounts for 33% of internet bandwidth between the hours of 9pm to midnight in North America.</UTT>I am guilty for contributing to that. That is how I wind down. Netflix and Youtube together are half ofpeak internet traffic in North America.</UTT>I'm am a watcher as well, every evening.  Wow, Blockbuster declined the purchase of Netflix for 50 million years ago, now Netflix is worth 2 billion, bet they regret that one!</UTT>I'll bet. Netflix still spends more money on postage than bandwidth though. I forgot that they still offer DVD rentals.</UTT>I used to participate in the DVD rentals but it's just easier to rent or buy from Vudu or Amazon prime or something.</UTT>Yeah, I usually run out of content to watch for a few days but it gives me a little break. Then new content is available for me to stream. So I don't usually have use for the DVDs.</UTT>I agree, I think I've watched all the Thrillers on Netflix and Prime, ha. There was actually a comic book series that came out about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheros, funny.</UTT>Have you heard of a superhero called normalman? He was the only person who didn't have powers on a planet full of superheroes.</UTT>No, I haven't.  I will have to look him up, never heard of him. Talk about being the odd one out, bet he feel really insecure on that planet!</UTT>Yeah, it's an interesting concept. Apparently Daredevil's season three is really good. I might have to check it out.</UTT>Oh my goodness, there's actually over 300 registered superheroes in the United States!</UTT>That's quite a bit. I wonder how many are Marvel and DC.</UTT>Good question, will have to look that one up also!  Garfield had a book series spinoff named Pet Force, it featured him and his gang as Superheroes, funny!</UTT>I'd like to check that out. Garfield is hilarious.</UTT>I still enjoy watching Garfield and Scooby Doo.  I remember, staying up late at night with a flashlight, reading Superman and Batman comic books, when they were like, ten or fifteen cents!</UTT>Wow, that's amazing. What great memories.</UTT>1

Hi, how are you?</UTT>I am well. Do you enjoy going to concerts?</UTT>I do, but sometimes they are overcrowded, do you go often?</UTT>Not as often as I used to. I prefer smaller venues rather than large stadiums or arenas. In croatia, there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue. That might be neat to attend!</UTT>I always see advertisements for them on facebook, do you use facebook often? I have been on for about 13 years!</UTT>Wow! I didn't realize it was only created in 2004- seems like it's been around forever!</UTT>I know, and in 2005, Myspace could have purchased it for 75 million, if only!</UTT>Seriously! Their initial IPO in 2012 valued them at $104 Billion!</UTT>I have heard the creator of facebook is red-green colorblind, so the logo is blue!</UTT>That is an interesting fact. In Iceland, they are using Facebook to rewrite their constitution and the public can make suggestions. Pretty cool!</UTT>Facebook seems very interesting in that sense, Burger King had a promotion to unfriend people for free food!</UTT>Haha. There are a couple people I would unfriend even without the free food! There is a state in Germany where the "like" button is illegal!</UTT>Why do you think that is the case?</UTT>I have no idea! I didn't realize Facebook was named after the facebook directories often given to American university students. I never had one of those in College.</UTT>I guess zuckerburg had a better idea since he went to Harvard, what a great school!</UTT>I didn't realize facebook was initially just for Harvard students.</UTT>I guess that makes sense on a test scale kind of thing, but that is pretty interesting!</UTT>Now anyone over 13 can join! 13 seems pretty young</UTT>That is way too young in my opinion, it is too easy to contact children, and that is not a good thing</UTT>Too many creeps out there. I did hear the age requirement varies based on local laws though.</UTT>That is good, but laws are so slow to adjust for the change of technology I think</UTT>1

I didn't realize it was only created in 2004- seems like it's been around forever!</UTT>That is way too young in my opinion, it is too easy to contact children, and that is not a good thing</UTT>I always see advertisements for them on facebook, do you use facebook often? I have been on for about 13 years!</UTT>Hi, how are you?</UTT>I guess that makes sense on a test scale kind of thing, but that is pretty interesting!</UTT>I didn't realize facebook was initially just for Harvard students.</UTT>I guess zuckerburg had a better idea since he went to Harvard, what a great school!</UTT>That is an interesting fact. In Iceland, they are using Facebook to rewrite their constitution and the public can make suggestions. Pretty cool!</UTT>Now anyone over 13 can join! 13 seems pretty young</UTT>Not as often as I used to. I prefer smaller venues rather than large stadiums or arenas. In croatia, there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue. That might be neat to attend!</UTT>Facebook seems very interesting in that sense, Burger King had a promotion to unfriend people for free food!</UTT>0
hi, do you watch the NBA?</UTT>Hi! Yes I'm excited for March Madness. I don't have a favorite team though, do you?</UTT>No I do not have one either. do you know who reggie miller is?</UTT>Yes, though I often confuse him with Reggie Bush, but Miller is the basketball guy. Anything he's famous for?</UTT>Well, he is a superstar but his sister was always better</UTT>Does his sister play for the WNBA?</UTT>I am not sure, maybe. She broke 8 national records once</UTT>Wow! That's no easy accomplishment. Same thing with Allen Iverson! He was so smart to sign a lifetime contract with Reebok to pay him $800K a year until he reaches age 55 and he'd get a lump sum of $32 million, talk about a great retirement fund!</UTT>THey can make so much money sometimes. Do you know who TIm Duncan is?</UTT>Yes! I used to really like him, does he still play for the Spurs?</UTT>I think he has retired maybe I am wrong. But apparently he decided to stay in college and finish before going to the NBA</UTT>Oh wow, I think he's one of the few! But seeing that they can make millions from endorsements, I guess they don't need to. Like Lebron James who rejected a $10 million offer and accepted a $90 million from nike years later.</UTT>Smart businessman for sure. Do you know what granny styl eis?</UTT>Yes! Of course! I wish pro basketball players made the granny style shot famous, I want to see someone incorporate that technique during one of the games.</UTT>Yeah and to think that the only reason they do not do tjat is because it looks funy. who cares, just score</UTT>Yeah! You think the name is what makes it embarrassing for the masculine players to use it? Even physicists have proved that granny style is the best technique!</UTT>Yeah exactly. Do you watch much tv?</UTT>Yes, I enjoy watching TV, my favorite genre to watch are dramas, how about you?</UTT>Yeah I like them. Did you ever watch House?</UTT>I used to watch it all the time and it's crazy to think about how someone who portrays a doctor make more than actual doctors! I think he made over $700K per episode!</UTT>Man he has made so much money but it was a good show for sure. nice chatting with you</UTT>1

Do you watch much tv?</UTT>Linkin Park is too new for me.  I had aged out of rock for a while there.  What's you favorite venue that you've been at.  I really enjoyed Bob Marley at the Greek theater in Berkeley.  Not ancient greek but really fun.</UTT>Yes, though I often confuse him with Reggie Bush, but Miller is the basketball guy.

Hello! Do you like lady gaga?</UTT>Yeah I think she is fascinating. The movie she did with Bradley Cooper was great.</UTT>I haven't seen it, but I do like that song from it! Her name came from the predictive text glitch that changed radio to lady! Interesting!</UTT>Very interesting. A star is born is good you should watch it. It was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut.</UTT>I will definitely check that out! Her favorite band is Iron maiden, I wouldn't have guessed that!</UTT>I wouldn't have guess that either. She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter.</UTT>That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once!</UTT>Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close.</UTT>I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous.</UTT>Yes I vaguely remember that show. I will have to look it up. She's one of the best selling music artists in history now. I bet she reminisces on those boiling point days.</UTT>Absolutely! Speaking of famous artists, Queens guitarist has a phd in astrophysics!</UTT>Yeah I remember that from the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, did you see it? He also uses coins as guitar picks.</UTT>I didn't see that one either, i'm really behind on movies it seems! The guitarist for muse hold a world record for most guitars smashed on a tour!</UTT>Yes I recommend that movie as well. Wow that must be a lot. Eddie Van Halen set a studio speaker on fire once!</UTT>That's crazy! Pink floyd turned a grand houseboat into a floating recording studio. That sounds awesome!</UTT>That sounds very awesome. I bet the river Thames has never seen such a party!</UTT>I bet! Linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.They must be busy people!</UTT>Wow very busy indeed. It must be nice to have such a successful debut album.</UTT>Yeah, they were pretty popular in the early 2000s. The ramones have played a total of 2263 concerts!</UTT>That is also a lot of concerts. I like going to concerts but the loud amplified sound of the electric guitar is very deafening. Thanks for talking with me this afternoon.</UTT>Yeah, it can get pretty loud! It was nice chatting with you!</UTT>Have a great afternoon. Bye!</UTT>1

Hello</UTT>Hi, how are you? Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Mostly you tube on my phone. I used to listen to the radio a lot more.</UTT>I listened when I was a kid. Not now. I use a computer.</UTT>Yeah. Im using my computer right now.</UTT>There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free. I wonder who visits that site. Probably an older generation.</UTT>I think it might be kind of cool to listen to a couple of them.</UTT>There are probably some good stories in there. Would you listen to the news in Latin though?</UTT>Nope. I couldnt understand it. Maybe I would if I was trying to learn latin.</UTT>Since 1989 a Finnish radio station has broadcast 'Nuntii latini' - a weekly news program conducted entirely in classical Latin</UTT>Did you know they made radios while fighting in WW2</UTT>I would expect the troops used radios in WW II. They needed to communicate.</UTT>They made their own radios using a razorblade and a pencil as the diobe</UTT>That is quite clever. Necessity is the mother of invention. I couldn't do it myself. I wonder what they could pick up.</UTT>Probably am radio or a bunch of german stuff</UTT>I wonder if they could hear the storms on Jupiter.</UTT>not sure. did you know that a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the sun</UTT>The surface of the sun is probably much cooler than the interior. I wonder if we could harness that lightning energy.</UTT>Yeah that or harness the suns rays effeciently.</UTT>The sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000 years. I wonder how much of that we could capture, and where would store it.</UTT>i think solar needs a lot of work then.</UTT>Solar has a lot of promise. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!</UTT>Me to. TTYL.</UTT>1

Hi. You hear about that shopping mall who hired a hawk to rid itself of the pigeon problem?</UTT>Hello, how are you? I did not hear about the shopping mall that hired a hawk to rid itself of a pigeon problem.</UTT>Yeah they used it 12 days a month and it decreased the pigeons from a few dozen to just a few!</UTT>That is great! The hawk was a terrific hunter! I would hire that hawk to get rid of my neighbors!</UTT>Haha me too. Birds are great. Some birds can migrate from alaska to mexico!</UTT>I figure that I could too if I had enough time. But I would have to sleep on the way. I couldn't stay away. The trip is too boring.</UTT>Yes good point. Most birds have hollow wings.</UTT>I think that the bones are hollow because they are lighter. Coincidentally, they are also stronger. My skull doesn't work the same way though.</UTT>Yes neither does mine! The only known bird without wings are the extinct moa and the elephant birds.</UTT>The moa and the elephant bird? What is an elephant bird? And how big are its poops? Good thing it didn't fly!</UTT>Good question but I'm not sure. Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct their nests!</UTT>I think that hummingbirds are thieving birds! Why must they take from the humble spider, our friend?</UTT>Haha yes they must love the web. They are not considered mans best friend like a dog is.</UTT>Dogs do not steal spider webs either. I appreciate their integrity.</UTT>Me too. Dogs are not color blind but they can't see as many colors as us.</UTT>I am proud of my color seeing abilities, but dogs can hear and smell better than me. I think that dogs are a great addition to any war party.</UTT>Yep absolutely right. I think it's cool how dogs were bred from wolves!</UTT>I think that we have found a true friend in dogs. I think that the wolves are jealous of our friendship with the dogs. They should be. Dogs have it pretty sweet.</UTT>Yea no doubt about that. Dogs perform many roles too from hunting to herding to friendship!</UTT>I think that they should help us with financial advice and taxes more. Anyway, great chat! Woof!</UTT>Yeah and remember google is also a dog company! You too bye!</UTT>1

I think that's kind of sad actually that people would judge a candidate based on their height. On the other hand it sounds a lot better than how they would do elections in ancient Athens haha</UTT>Haha yes they must love the web.

Hi! Are you a dog lover?</UTT>Hey there do you like horror movies? Can you believe that Stephen King thinks Bambi is a horror movie? It's a really sad movie but I wouldn't say it's scary</UTT>A horror film?  Well, if horror films help you burn more calories, it is nice to think that watching Bambi is apart of a good diet plan!</UTT>Haha that's a good plan! And sorry I missed your first question, I do like dogs a lot. I need a dog so that I can go on walks to burn calories, and then we can watch horror movies together to cuddle and I will also burn calories doing that LOL</UTT>Nice! Did you know, if you watch a horror film before you go to the museum, it will help yo appreciate abstract art better?  But don't take your dog tot he museum! They have a different response when they see a 65 millioon year old dinosaur skeleton. They think, bones!  Thank you God!</UTT>LOL ok I'll make sure not to do that, also I feel bad, at least they are not colorblind but they definitely can't see as many colors as humans can, that is weird</UTT>It is God's way of trying to even the playing field. The dog can smell better, run faster, jump higher, and hear better than we can. But at least we can see more colors.</UTT>Haha well I like that too. I also like that Google prefers dogs to cats. They put that in their company policy which is amazing, that's why I like Google LOL</UTT>Nice! Google is awesome, but dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing, so Google made agood choice in not making elephants their official animal of choice. They would need biger offices!</UTT>Haha that seems so interesting. Why don't gorillas know what pointing is? Wouldn't you think that they would LOL? They're so smart and everything. but we should do what is stanbul does with stray dogs, have you heard about that?</UTT>Yes, their vending machines for dog food in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. Nice idea. I might start doing that with breakfast cereal.</UTT>Haha you should do that! Dogs are so cool though, I love how they have dog blood drives, it's crazy that there are 12 different dog blood types, do you think that they get treats once they give blood?</UTT>I do. It is only fair that they do also, although my dog doesn't care for orange juice. I try to explain to the dog that 80% of the earth's rain forests are gone, so don't knock the orange juice until you try it, but my dog still doesn't get it...</UTT>Haha such a poor doggo. that is sad that all that Forest is gone, also weird that we will run out of helium by the end of the 21st century, what will all the balloon stores use to fill up the balloons?</UTT>Flatulence, of course. I explained this concept to my dog, but he would not fart in a balloon for me.  In frustration, I exclaimed that if earth's history was one 24-hr day, then human history would only be 1 minute and 17 seconds. My dog responded, then why does it take you over two minites to refill my bowl?</UTT>Haha you need to create a store that sells dog fart balloons LOL I guarantee you someone would buy them haha. What do you think about the un Ambassador that they have ambassador to extraterrestrials must have a really lonely job lol</UTT>Yeah, and training for an impending invasion is difficult. Like how many times can one person watch the movie, Mars Attacks?  And if Earth is the densest planet in our solar system, why would any sensible alien want to stop off and speak to dense earthlings anyway?</UTT>Haha I agree with you. Nice job bringing up Mars Attacks too, that's a movie I haven't thought about in a long time haha. That is almost a horror movie, I will be able to burn the 180 calories if I watch that again. Have you ever seen the movie The Shining by the way</UTT>Yes. A nice film you can watch with the whole family. You just can't let them know that it is a horror film until they grow up... like they did with the actor that played the role of little Danny!</UTT>I know right! I'm so happy that he didn't know he was in a horror movie. That would definitely have messed him up. Have you heard of a water phone? And no, it's not a phone that runs on water LOL</UTT>No, what is a water phone? This isn't some joke about how 71% of the earth is covered with water, so you are bound to reach  water even by telephone?</UTT>Haha I wish it were a joke. But it's an instrument actually. It makes that weird creepy metallic noise that you hear in horror movies. Maybe I should buy one LOL</UTT>1

Hello, do you watch television?</UTT>Yes, I do. I watch Big Bang Theory and the national news.</UTT>Love the big bang theory!  Im a few seasons behind lol</UTT>Do you watch Saturday Night Live?</UTT>No not really.  you?  Did you know there are 750 episodes of pokemon?</UTT>Yes, I do.  That's a lot of episodes.</UTT>Its like 16 years of episodes !</UTT>Apparently, most deals made on the shark tank show are never enacted.</UTT>Thats sad,  what a fake tv show then.</UTT>I think it is.  I watch it from time to time when nothing else is better.</UTT>Do you like to travel?  I hear the dutch are making a high speed commiuter bus that travels 160 mph</UTT>Yes, I do.  I went to Netherlands twice.  That bus is too fast for me.  I do not plan to ride on it.</UTT>Oh really lol I would definitely try it.  In Japan,  crossing the country will take $300 in tolls!</UTT>I cannot afford that.  I will take trains instead.</UTT>Right,  not to mention I will have a hard time driving on the opposite side of the road.</UTT>I heard that there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you are traveling.  Do you know about the website?</UTT>yeah I think its called couchsurfing.com or something like that.  I have never used it though.  i wouldnt mind though!</UTT>I do not like to stay at strangers' houses.  I have never stayed at airbnb either.</UTT>Oh wow,  Ive stayed in a lot of airbnb and even a hostel.  I dont mind it,  especially if I need to save money for more important traveling expenses.</UTT>I'm female and old.  So, I'm not as courageous as young people.</UTT>Fair enough.  Its been great chatting with you,  thanks for the conversation.</UTT>1

Its been great chatting with you,  thanks for the conversation.</UTT>Oh really lol I would definitely try it.  In Japan,  crossing the country will take $300 in tolls!</UTT>Right,  not to mention I will have a hard time driving on the opposite side of the road.</UTT>0
Hello, are you interested in Cricket?</UTT>Hello.  I think Cricket is interesting although I have never played.  I think it is one of the only games I can think of that has 11 players on a field at a time.</UTT>Yes, sounds interesting that the players of the batting side score runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat while the bowling and fielding side try to prevent this and dismiss each player so that they are 'out'.</UTT>That is interesting. I meant to say that each team has 11 players on the field at a time.  I didn't know there was International Cricket Council.  Did you?</UTT>Yeah, I heard about that.  I also heard that there's an all US born Cricket team from Compton that won the British cup twice.</UTT>That is awesome!  It seems like Australia does very well in cricket considering they have won 45% of all world cups.</UTT>Not only that but the Australians have also appeared in 63% of all finals and have won 71% of their final appearances.</UTT>I had heard that somewhere.  However, apparently both England and Australia had diplomatic consequences for using nasty tactics against history's best cricket player.  It sounds like this game can get serious.</UTT>Apparently, it can get nasty and go for a really long time as well. The longest match in the history of cricket was in 1939 England playing against South Africa that took part in a single match that lasted 14 days.</UTT>That would be a really long match.  I wonder if people stayed to watch.  Some cricket players have interesting names like the professional Indian cricket player Napoleon Einstein.</UTT>I thought that was cool too. They keep playing until ten players have been dismissed, then the innings end and they sway roles. That 14 day game must have been exhausting for the players. They probably had extra players coming in from each side to pull that off.</UTT>They must have been.  I think it is interesting that the game of cricket spread globally when the British Empire expanded.</UTT>I think a game close to Cricket is played in most other countries except the US where football reigns in the sports arena as the national pastime.</UTT>Football is extremely popular in America which is probably why those with successful careers in sports are often associated with celebrity status.</UTT>Yes, that's certainly true. Celebrity status is often associated with wealth referred to as fame and fortune, while fame more often provides opportunities to earn revenue. Football certainly lends itself well to that aforementioned celebrity status.</UTT>I think it is interesting that as popular as football is that LeBron James is the highest paid celebrity followed by Judge Judy,</UTT>Agree on that, too. Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode. Wow, I wonder just how much Lebron James rakes in then?</UTT>Right!  I can't believe that.  Celebrities also get special perks like a secret room at Pixar studio that they can visit.  I wonder if Judge Judy or Lebron James ever visits there.</UTT>Good question. They both have probably been there!  Celebrity status gives many perks that common people would never know about.  I know that Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street. I bet that was a real honor for Elmo and the rest of the gang!</UTT>Yes.  She is pretty funny.  Speaking of funny actors, Robin Williams started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films in Aladdin.</UTT>Yes, he was such a funny guy. Other countries also have celebrities too. Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who thinks he can combat his country's hunger problems by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods.</UTT>1

Have you ever heard of the book "the book of lists"? it was published back in 1977</UTT>I may have. I'm guessing from the title that it's full of lists of varying categories?</UTT>Haha I don't know for sure but that is a good guess lol. I don't know why people would read lists in a book though, when you could read them on the Internet, do you ever use the internet</UTT>I actually love lists ha ha. Yes I use the internet constantly.</UTT>If you use it constantly, have used the hamburger button before?</UTT>I'm not sure. What is a hamburger button?</UTT>It's a menu button, it looks like three horizontal lines, I think that Reddit has it on their website actually</UTT>I do know that button. I have used it a lot. I had no idea it had a name. Were you aware that on the international space station astronauts have faster internet connection than most Americans?</UTT>No I didn't know about that I wish I had their internet though LOL. Do you ever read the terms of service when you use the internet by the way</UTT>I am super guilty of not reading them.</UTT>Yep me too. Would you ever climb Mount Everest by the way? It's good to know that they have 3-g service at the peak</UTT>I'm amazed that you can get internet there. I wonder how that's possible. I'm still not climbing it though ha ha.</UTT>Yeah the internet really is amazing, it's shocking that the Library of Alexandria actually runs a backup of the internet in case it ever goes down, that must be a huge file LOL</UTT>I can't imagine how much storage space that would take!</UTT>I wonder to how many people have the internet addiction in terms of clicking links, I probably do myself LOL</UTT>I have definitely been down several internet rabbit holes myself. Do you know what the act of looking yourself up on the internet is called?</UTT>I think it's called ego surfing right? I have definitely done that at least once or twice haha. Do you like dogs by the way</UTT>It is. I love dogs. I love all animals actually.</UTT>Well I didn't know about dogs that they have twelve different blood types, did you know that? They also do dog blood drives</UTT>I had no idea. I'm glad they do the drives because that means they would need a lot of blood to save lives with that many different types.</UTT>Yes I agree I just hope they get a cookie after the drive LOL. I even like knowing that Google is officially a dog company because they put that in their code of conduct</UTT>1

I just found out that both Curry and Lebron are both from the same city - Akron, Ohio! That's crazy!</UTT>I am huge fans of both of theirs!</UTT>Yeah, I had no idea! I'm not a huge fan, but I can enjoy the odd game! Who do you root for?</UTT>I always root for Golden State and Steph.</UTT>That's pretty cool! I was so surprised to find out that Curry doesn't get the highest salary though, not even close!</UTT>No he doesn't but he does have what could end up being a one billion dollar deal with Under Armour.</UTT>Oh, Absolutely! I understand that Nike tried to sign him, but they did a terrible job; even had Durant's name on the presentation.</UTT>I saw that story!  That was insane and a complete show of incompetence!</UTT>Yeah, it's crazy the money that goes into these things! Even when you're losing games, teams make money from the promotional/ad stuff</UTT>Do you know his dad was in the NBA as well?</UTT>Yeah, his dad was wardell, right? And so curry is actually Wardell Stephen Curry II?</UTT>Yeah but he was called "Dell" for short. He is usually at the games.</UTT>Yeah, I guess it's a family event for some! Just like Reggie Miller with his sister!</UTT>His daughter always seems to steal the spotlight though...lol</UTT>I know, it's crazy! He scores 40 points, she scores 105! Like how do you even outscore that?!</UTT>I meant that she is so cute that everyone notices her more than Steph.</UTT>Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood. You mean Curry's sister?</UTT>No, I was talking about Curry's young daughter.</UTT>Oh, I see! That's sweet though! So is she into basketball too, like him?</UTT>She can be quite funny in front of the media and the camera!</UTT>That is so awesome!! Is she somehow involved with the foundation Curry's a part of? That donates mosquito nets?</UTT>Yep, 3 nets per 3-pointer. That is so wonderful of an idea.</UTT>1

What do you enjoy for entertainment?</UTT>I enjoy catching up on news and listening to music, though I've only recently dabbled into jazz music. Yourself?</UTT>I enjoy jazz as well, especially how it kept its core but absorbed local musical culture to derive distinctive styles</UTT>Yeah, but Hitler once suppressed jazz which he condemned as "degenerate" because of its association with Jewish and black composers and musicians, I'm happy we've come a long way since then!</UTT>Did you know henry ford also tried to suppress jazz by financing country music instead for the very same reason that it was urban decadence.</UTT>Wow! I didn't know that, really interesting how there's geographical differences in jazz music, like New Orleans Jazz, Kansas City Jazz, Gypsy Jazz, I wonder if I'd be able to tell the difference. Would you be able to?</UTT>Jazz is still jazz. They are distinct, but similar at the core</UTT>I see, I wish I could sing like Jazz's great Ella Fitzgerald who even taught herself how to sing 2 notes at once at the age of 18!</UTT>Given your interest in jazz, what instrument do you play?</UTT>I used to play the guitar but quit when one of my strings broke and just gave it up, do you play any instruments?</UTT>Did you play by hand, with a pick, or a coin? I dabbled here and there with piano and violin</UTT>I didn't know you could play by coin! I strummed it with my fingers  or with a pick. There's a very tiny guitar, the size of a red blood cell that was built by Cornell researchers, it needs to be played via laser. I wonder why they invented that.</UTT>Probably just because they could</UTT>It's amazing the mechanics of things that goes to make sounds, Brian May of Queen built his own guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother's knitting needle, I'd say ouch</UTT>I wonder how it sounded. On a sperate note, eddie van halen set his speakers on fire when he soloed beat it</UTT>Wow, that can happen? Was it an accident or was it for entertainment purposes?</UTT>I think because of the music, he taxed the speakers till it burst into flames. At least he didn't intentionally destroy instruments like matthew bellamy who holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed on tour</UTT>Yeah, I think that could get very expensive but small price to pay for the entertainment revenue it brings in. Like the Olsen twins purchased an entertainment company back in early 2000s and have turned it into a billion dollar company! No wonder I don't hear about them anymore.</UTT>True these people are very dedicated. The guitarist of pink floyd even made a floating recording studio</UTT>Maybe that's what it takes to get the perfect vibrato sound when he records. Were any notable records produced on that floating studio?</UTT>Not sure, but it is called the astoria. Well thanks for chatting, I hope you also had a good time.</UTT>1

Do you like Fifth Harmony?</UTT>I have not heard of it. What is it?</UTT>They are a band, they sing "Work From Home."</UTT>Seems like they are taking their own advice and taking a break, while they work from home.</UTT>yeah, it is not a bad idea. Everyone gets burned out sometimes.</UTT>What kind of music do they play? Is that the band that Diddy created?</UTT>I think it is like pop/rap, pretty good stuff.</UTT>Is it anything like Psy's gangnam style? That got so many views that they had to upgrade the view counter to integer to 64 bits.</UTT>No, but I do like the gangnam style. Did you know youtube is the second largest search engine on the net?</UTT>Behind Google? Huh... Doesn't google own YouTube? Seems logical if they do own it. YouTube and Netflix make half of peak internet traffic.</UTT>Crazy isn't it? Yeah they do. Justin Biebers song is the most disliked song on youtube. Hilarious!</UTT>Why they hatin on Biebs.... I hate to admit that if one of his good songs come on, I will jam to it. But it;s only like 2 songs and neither are baby.</UTT>I don't honestly know any of his music.</UTT>HA! Now I feel like a loser. Well let me redeem myself. Did you know Floyd recorded a live album at Pompeii with no one there?</UTT>No, I was unaware, where the volcano went off?</UTT>Yeah. Do you like Pink Floyd?</UTT>They are ok. I haven't listened to them in a long time though.</UTT>What about Creed. Do you listen to them</UTT>Yeah, they are ok, but I hear they are bad live.</UTT>Yeah. Like get sued by your fans, bad!</UTT>Yeah, hilarious. Nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

Hey there what do you think of our current system of government? I was shocked to learn that Nevada is mostly owned by the US government</UTT>Yeah all 86% of the land, I wonder what they do with it really</UTT>I know right. Although I do know that Nevada is mostly desert, but still. Did you hear about the Man Who Sold the Eiffel Tower twice? That was risky.</UTT>Haha I wonder how he got away with it twice. Do you know what wikileaks is?</UTT>I have heard of WikiLeaks. Didn't they publish plans that the government was trying to destroy them? That's so insane</UTT>yeah, they must have an inside man. Did you hear about the Norwegian government's plan to save the rainforest?</UTT>No I didn't what did they do? I did hear that the u.s. Passed a law that would protect government employees from being persecuted if they violated the Geneva Convention though, that seems really weird</UTT>Yeah tha is weird and the Norwegians donated $1 billion, that is a whole lot of money.</UTT>I know right! How often do you travel by the way? Have you ever been to Norway?</UTT>I have not actually but would like to visit at some point. In Iceland as well but would have to get a car</UTT>Well apparently Iceland doesn't have public service rails, and so you just fly between cities, so maybe you don't need a car LOL</UTT>Yeah if that makes it cheaper sure. Or maybe they will get one of those Dutch buses that go 160 mph</UTT>Haha I would definitely ride that. What I wouldn't ride is a highway system in Japan. All of them are private and all have tolls</UTT>Yeah and it would cost you $300 to travel the country</UTT>Yep exactly. That sounds really annoying. Have you ever been to Mackinac Island in Michigan?</UTT>I have never but would like to go how that works without any motorized vehicles, must be so peaceful there</UTT>Oh I agree with you. But it also smells like horses everywhere haha. I have been there and there are no Cars, just horses.</UTT>Yeah I guess that might be the downside. DO you know who was the first king to travel the world?</UTT>Wasn't at the king of Hawaii? I wonder what made him do it. What do you think?</UTT>Yup that was him. I am not sure though why he did it. Did you know that Venus does not tilt?</UTT>Wow I didn't know that. I miss Pluto is a planet by the way! Also apparently Venus rotates clockwise</UTT>1

Do you ever play video games?</UTT>I do not but my son plays them, he'd play more if I let him.</UTT>Mine does too!  Constantly if I would let him! He loves to play fortnite which is a multiplayer game</UTT>That is my sons drug, I mean game, of choice.  He's played a bunch of other video games but Fortnite is the one that he'll play if he were allowed just one.</UTT>Yep! Mine is addicted too. Did you know that the first multiplayer first person shooter used a music protocol for networking?</UTT>I did not know that, and now you say it I have to admit I don't really know what that means.  Do your have phones yet?</UTT>Do we have phones? We all have cell phones.</UTT>That's what I meant, my son wants a cell phone but we haven't let him yet, he's in fifth grade, but we'll have to get him one soon, most of his friends have them.</UTT>Yep. I have a seventh grader and a senior in high school so they have phones. We got my youngest one at the end of 5th grade since he was moving up to middle school. Did you know that NY area code is 212 because it is the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. Not like that matters anymore!</UTT>Why does New York get  to choose?  I work in a school, the kids are on the phones at every opportunity, but I suppose that is the modern world.  Just like Netflix has replaced Blockbuster</UTT>They are on them constant. How about how blockbuster declined to buy netflix for $50 million. It is now worth $2 billion. Not so smart in hind sight.</UTT>Someone must be kicking themselves, like the person that turned down the Beatles before they made it.  We cut our cable about two years back, don't miss it in any way.</UTT>It is so expensive. I would rather have Netflix. Did you know that Netflix and youtube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. I don't doubt it.</UTT>I can well believe it, if I think of how I use the internet, mainly to watch Youtube or Netflix.</UTT>I think it is funny how netflix came about. All because of a $40 late fee for apollo 13 it was started.</UTT>They always don't upset your customers.  I understand that there are still one or two Blockbusters in Alaska, where the internet is as widely available.  It's still, probably, just a matter of time.</UTT>Yep.  I bet Alaska is way behind the times. Plus the internet capabilities may not be that great since it is such a huge area.</UTT>I wonder how there cell phone coverage is there.  Maybe the kids in Alaska aren't as addicted to their phones and social media.</UTT>You could only hope!  I can't pry my kids away from their electronics. Not a good thing.</UTT>The kids are getting sneaky too,  It's hard to stay ahead of them, with these fake apps and secondary social media pages.  My kids are already too clever for me.</UTT>So are mine. And Snapchat is the worst!  good talking to you today!! Have  a good day.</UTT>Same here, have a good day. Bye.</UTT>1
Mine does too!  Constantly if I would let him! He loves to play fortnite which is a multiplayer game</UTT>Yep.  I bet Alaska is way behind the times. Plus the internet capabilities may not be that great since it is such a huge area.</UTT>Same here, have a good day. Bye.</UTT>Someone must be kicking themselves, like the person that turned down the Beatles before they made it.  We cut our cable about two years back, don't miss it in any way.</UTT>It is so expensive. I would rather have Netflix. Did you know that Netflix and youtube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. I don't doubt it.</UTT>Yep! Mine is addicted too. Did you know that the first multiplayer first person shooter used a music protocol for networking?</UTT>The Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring Jack Black. I would like to have seen that version. It would probably be better than the actual one. Jack is a natural comedian. I wonder what Bill Murray would have said.</UTT>That's what I meant, my son wants a cell phone but we haven't let him yet, he's in fifth grade, but we'll have to get him one soon, most of his friends have them.</UTT>So are mine. And Snapchat is the worst!  good talking to you today!! Have  a good day.</UTT>I think it is funny how netflix came about. All because of a $40 late fee for apollo 13 it was started.</UTT>They are on them constant. How about how blockbuster declined to buy netflix for $50 million. It is now worth $2 billion. Not so smart in hind sight.</UTT>They always don't upset your customers.  I understand that there are still one or two Blockbusters in Alaska, where the internet is as widely available.  It's still, probably, just a matter of time.</UTT>I wonder how there cell phone coverage is there.  Maybe the kids in Alaska aren't as addicted to their phones and social media.</UTT>I did not know that, and now you say it I have to admit I don't really know what that means.  Do your have phones yet?</UTT>Yep. I have a seventh grader and a senior in high school so they have phones. We got my youngest one at the end of 5th grade since he was moving up to middle school. Did you know that NY area code is 212 because it is the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. Not like that matters anymore!</UTT>I do not but my son plays them, he'd play more if I let him.</UTT>Do you ever play video games?</UTT>The kids are getting sneaky too,  It's hard to stay ahead of them, with these fake apps and secondary social media pages.  My kids are already too clever for me.</UTT>Do we have phones? We all have cell phones.</UTT>I can well believe it, if I think of how I use the internet, mainly to watch Youtube or Netflix.</UTT>That is my sons drug, I mean game, of choice.  He's played a bunch of other video games but Fortnite is the one that he'll play if he were allowed just one.</UTT>You could only hope!  I can't pry my kids away from their electronics. Not a good thing.</UTT>0
Hey have you ever seen the movie Isle of dogs? It was directed by Wes Anderson</UTT>Is that the one where dogs are fighting on an island?  It seemed a bit sketchy for a kids movie</UTT>Yes that's the one. It's actually not a bad movie, I liked it and it's rated PG-13, there's not too much violence or anything from what I saw</UTT>Yes but there was definitely language in it that was not for children!</UTT>Yes there is also a reference to dogs being in heat, which is kind of weird because it is Clay animation, but I think kids will be ok watching it</UTT>Yeah I will have to check it out.  Any movie with dogs cannot be all bad?  After all they are mans best friend</UTT>They are. There are also about 12 different dog blood types, I wonder if there are blood drives for them</UTT>Yes animals in surgery need blood too!  Did you know Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog?</UTT>No I didn't know that what did that dog do? I also didn't know that dogs are not actually colorblind they just can't see all of the colors that humans can</UTT>Right.  Which is good because there are dogs in Moscow who ride the subway and without colors it might be hard for them to tell what line to get on!</UTT>Yeah that's possible. Why do you think only dogs and elephants can understand pointing though? I wonder why gorillas or even Dolphins can't they're also smart</UTT>I am not sure.   But dogs can learn over a thousand words and are better at reasoning than chimps.  That surprises me</UTT>Have you ever put a dog inside your car before? I like how they let their ears flop around in the Wind</UTT>Yes!  It is fun!  I followed a horse truck down the road last week where they were doing the same thing.  Dogs are so smart - they love solving problems and earning rewards..</UTT>Well I was driving my car with my dog and we actually stopped at a drive-thru, I never knew that drive-thrus were started in 1975</UTT>Right - McDonalds did it to help the soldiers.  That was nice of them.</UTT>Yes I agree. The soldiers could not get out of their car if they were wearing fatigues so McDonald's created the drive-up window, Burger King should let us put flamethrowers on our cars so we can get that flame grilled taste on the go lol</UTT>laugh!  I know - I wonder if google's cars which have an "aggressive" mode come with flamethrowers?</UTT>Haha well that would make me scared to drive a car LOL. What about the trunk of a car? Do you know where the name for that came from</UTT>Didn't the old cars from the early 1900's actually have wooden trunks on them?  They probably should avoid the flamethrowers</UTT>Haha that's a good point. I used to play this video game called Gran Turismo back in the day, apparently someone got so good that they became a real race car driver after playing it</UTT>1

Hey there, do you have much interest in nature?</UTT>About the same as the average person.  I don't mind a short hike in the woods, or sitting by a river trying to catch some fish.</UTT>Nice, sounds fun. Did you know that there are species of fish that can eat prey twice their size?</UTT>I'd like to see what they look like after a meal.  Like I feel after Thanksgiving.</UTT>Hahaha so true. Yeah, they are called the black swallower, how fitting their name.</UTT>Is a jellyfish a fish?  I heard there is one that is immortal!</UTT>Yeah that is the one species of jellyfish that scientists have been studying for so long trying to crack their secret. I guess sometimes it is hard to tell what a fish is, like the seahorse.</UTT>I just don't know how you know something is immortal.</UTT>they must have studied them for so long. same as they do a lot of experimenting with zebra fish.</UTT>Speaking of science and up to date technology, it turns out the White House still uses floppy disks.  to store date.</UTT>Old school but there must be a good reason for it. speaking of the white house, it has twin buildings in ireland and france.</UTT>I wonder why that is and who built them.  I used to live in DC, we always looked forward to see the tree go up around the White House.</UTT>I do not know actually and I wonder also who lives there. Well good you got a chance to see it now. Apparently Roosevlet banned them from the white house</UTT>Yeah, bit of a conservationist.  Just like the Norwegians, they donated a billion dollars to the amazon rain forest once.</UTT>That is a  lot of money. On the other hand the US government has really shifted their focus towards protecting their employees from prosecution if they violate geneva conventions</UTT>I wonder if it's against the Geneva Convention to see national monuments.  A man in France pretended to work for the government and sold the Eiffel Tower, not once but twice!</UTT>That is just insane, wow. Do you know when the White HOuse started getting used as a president's house?</UTT>I understand since John Adams.  Isn't he the second president.</UTT>That house must require a lot of maintenance. I wonder if they still have the solar panel that George Bush put back in it?</UTT>'d like to think of Bush up there installing them himself, with his tool belt on and cursing as things don't go right. You'd think it would be a Democrat putting up solar.</UTT>Hahaha well there you go. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good one</UTT>1

Its good to see Peterson doing so well again for the Redskins</UTT>Yes third straigh victory</UTT>I hope the shoulder doesn't affect his play</UTT>Yeah. What about Trent Williams? He played with a dislocated thumb.</UTT>I would think it might be harder to play with a shoulder injury than a thumb injury</UTT>Well, yes. Any injury when trying to play would not be fun in my book.</UTT>Do you think Peterson can lead the Redskins into the playoffs with Smith out with a broken leg?</UTT>I don't know. Being without the quaterback they're used to could throw things off for them.</UTT>The Redskins are on the edge right now so I'm not sure Peterson is the answer. The Giants on the other hand are just horrible this year.</UTT>Yeah. What do you think of Eli Manning?</UTT>I think its time for him to retire or turn the ball over to another qb</UTT>haha He'd be okay being he has a "geinus-level" IQ.</UTT>He is far from a genious in my book.</UTT>Yeah, not my words, just what I've heard.</UTT>Eli has made way too many "bad" decisions with the ball this year in my opinion. I have watched several of their games this year.</UTT>Yeah. What do you suppose his dad and brother think of how he's been doing?</UTT>I'm sure they are trying to help as much as they can. I heard Payton has been sitting down with him and going over game film.</UTT>Makes sense. Who do you think was the best of the Manning clan?</UTT>Definitely Payton!</UTT>Hopefully Eli can learn from him then haha</UTT>Happy Holidays!</UTT>1

Crazy that myspace had a chance to buy facebook for only $75 mil</UTT>Missed opportunity. Their IPO was $104 Billion. Wish I could have invested back in the day.</UTT>I think we all would like that! Even for things like google</UTT>Google was smart when they bought Youtube in 2006.</UTT>Crazy to think about the 1.65 billion dollar price. But it has paid off for them with the ad revenue</UTT>YEah nice! All the videos on youtube are cool</UTT>Except for Justin bieber's "baby" is the most disliked video on youtube. I think it was just beat out though</UTT>Gangam style was so popular they had to change how they counted videos.</UTT>Many celebrities have their own youtube channels</UTT>The police even have their own youtube called blutube.</UTT>Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james</UTT>That a lot. Did you Carol Burnett was the first celeb to appear on Sesame Street?</UTT>I did not! Celebrity status is often associated with wealth. And  fame often provides opportunities to earn revenue.</UTT>true. There's an Ethiopian celebrity using his celebrity for good trying to convince his people to diversify their diet.</UTT>Thats a interesting thing to try and get people to do</UTT>Speaking of use their influence Burger King apparently was giving people Whoppers if they unfriended 10 people on facebook!</UTT>thats silly. Iceland are rewriting their constitution via facebook; allowing the public to make suggestions and alterations. What a use for social media</UTT>Better than banning the like button like they did in a part of Germany.</UTT>I dont even get the point of that</UTT>I wonder if they block the like button on Youtube? It's the second largest search engine in the world.</UTT>That would be nuts. On account that Netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic in north america</UTT>1

What are your interests?</UTT>I enjoy listening to music. I really like Linkin Park, and their 'Hybrid Theory' album is the top selling in the 21st century.</UTT>My favorite band is One Direction. I know a few songs of Linkin Park.</UTT>I like them too. I think it's interesting that even though Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was released over 40 years ago, it was actually in the top sellers back in 2014.</UTT>I miss when One Direction were together. That is interesting.</UTT>I hate it when good bands break up. There was a set of Japanese twins that actually made a rap album together at the age of 100! I think that's pretty awesome.</UTT>If only I know the name of the Japanese twin's music, I would be down to listen to it?</UTT>I can't recall, but it's great to listen and watch, so you should check it out. I love comedy, so it fell into that area. Do you like?</UTT>Can you recommend me some comedy?</UTT>Sure! I really enjoy movies like Pineapple Express and the Hangover. Although some people think of them as 'bromantic' comedies, I just think they are funny overall. Do you like that kind?</UTT>I do like that kind</UTT>Have you watched the comedy show 3rd Rock? It received the best comedy Golden Globe in 97. It even beat Friends and Seinfeld, which are really good shows.</UTT>I have not. What is that?</UTT>It's just a funny comedy, but it's pretty old, but still good. You should also check out some movies with the actor Ryan Stiles, he's pretty funny. Do you know him?</UTT>Is it on Netflix? If it is, I'll try to watch it. I do not know him.</UTT>I'm not sure, it's possible. did you know that in Africa, people can legally add a flame-thrower to their car to stop carjackings? I couldn't believe that was legal! It's actually kind of funny...</UTT>Is the flamethrower attached to the car?</UTT>Yes, and completely legal! I guess they handle their protection a bit more serious than us in America. I'm glad we have them now, instead of buggies with horses though.</UTT>That is cool!</UTT>There's a race car driver that actually began that profession because they beat over 90,000 people at the video game gran turismo named Jann Mardenborough. They are very skilled, I'd say lol</UTT>Nice to chat with you.</UTT>1

Hello,  how are you doing?  Do you like football? The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink</UTT>I guess the pink is meant to soften up the opposition. The game of football certainly has a lot of interesting history.</UTT>yeah.  I cant imagine its for intimidation lol In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars</UTT>Football hadn't developed as much of a sport then. I've heard that many of the world's biggest stadiums belong to college football teams. Not surprised. In some towns, there's not much else to do on a Saturday.</UTT>Right.  College football has a lot of funding too.</UTT>That's true at the high school level, too. The stadium in Allen, Texas, cost $60 million. That's for high school!</UTT>Wow,  well Texas does love its football. The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0</UTT>I never expected a tech school to be good at football, but probably Cumberland was just a tiny college. The football coaches get paid insane amounts these days.</UTT>I know right.  Former partiots rb benjarvus green-ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career.</UTT>That is an achievement!</UTT>thats incredible. Did you know Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago</UTT>Perhaps they didn't need it with the discovery of fire and the creation of clothing.</UTT>Yeah probably just adapting to the environment.</UTT>Human beings haven't been around that long, either. If you looked at the earth's history as 24 hours, we've been here for only 1 minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>Wow.  Humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals.</UTT>Doesn't sound like much of an ability, but it has allowed us to spread around the globe. Now we're going out into space!</UTT>yup! This is a bummer Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective</UTT>We depend on other creatures to get the nutrition we need. Did you know that we are the only mammals that can't swallow and breathe at the same time?</UTT>I feel like I only know this from experience.  There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.</UTT>That's probably the same frequency for a lot of animals. Something about the earth moving I bet.</UTT>Great talking to you have a good one.</UTT>1
That's true at the high school level, too. The stadium in Allen, Texas, cost $60 million. That's for high school!</UTT>no they shouldnt be going to school to play games and get paid,</UTT>We depend on other creatures to get the nutrition we need. Did you know that we are the only mammals that can't swallow and breathe at the same time?</UTT>Hello,  how are you doing?  Do you like football? The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink</UTT>Football hadn't developed as much of a sport then. I've heard that many of the world's biggest stadiums belong to college football teams. Not surprised. In some towns, there's not much else to do on a Saturday.</UTT>Yeah probably just adapting to the environment.</UTT>That's probably the same frequency for a lot of animals. Something about the earth moving I bet.</UTT>Right.  College football has a lot of funding too.</UTT>Human beings haven't been around that long, either. If you looked at the earth's history as 24 hours, we've been here for only 1 minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>I know right.  Former partiots rb benjarvus green-ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career.</UTT>Doesn't sound like much of an ability, but it has allowed us to spread around the globe. Now we're going out into space!</UTT>Wow,  well Texas does love its football. The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0</UTT>yup! This is a bummer Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective</UTT>Great talking to you have a good one.</UTT>I feel like I only know this from experience.  There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.</UTT>I never expected a tech school to be good at football, but probably Cumberland was just a tiny college. The football coaches get paid insane amounts these days.</UTT>I guess the pink is meant to soften up the opposition. The game of football certainly has a lot of interesting history.</UTT>yeah.  I cant imagine its for intimidation lol In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars</UTT>Perhaps they didn't need it with the discovery of fire and the creation of clothing.</UTT>Wow.  Humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals.</UTT>thats incredible. Did you know Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago</UTT>0
Hi how are you?</UTT>Great.  Who would think Trump's tariffs on China would help people who trade in knockoff designer bags?</UTT>HA! That's funny... Knockoff handbags... I think the whole idea is just weird. What a weird thing to stump on...</UTT>I know, not a designer kind of guy myself... There's another $200 billion around the corner.  It hurts businesses that have legit designer handbags.</UTT>Im not either. It hurts a lot of the american businesses too.</UTT>Yep.  Beijing has promised to crack down on the counterfeiters but I'm not holding my breath.</UTT>No... it does not benefit them to do so. like reading those pesky terms of service when buying something online.</UTT>Yeah, I never read that.  Only 7% of people do.</UTT>I always just click accept and hope for the best. I am part of the 93%. If you are on mt everest, you can read it with your 3G!</UTT>Good to know.  I'm a 93%-er too. I love the internet but use it mostly for keeping up with people, shopping and entertainment.</UTT>Are you on Facebook? I tried giving it up for this year, only when I need it, and dont really miss it.</UTT>I am but I'm mostly an observer/commenter...</UTT>When I was on there I almost only looked at people's profiles. I have nothing to add and I hated to brag about stuff I do with photos.</UTT>Did you know most countries don't have what we call a President?</UTT>I did not know that. That's different.</UTT>OK. Yeah if you were a "President" you could go to all those summit meeting with big wigs from other countries.  That actually sounds boring.</UTT>No... I would actually wear big wigs and have so much fun. I would do the whole thing with a glass of wine.</UTT>Cool. You sound like the Indonesian President that released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Ha! Are Indonesians that hungry for music?</UTT>Must be.  I don't know what genre that is... They could have a big dance party instead of a boring summit meeting.  They could network it on 3g.</UTT>Nice chatting with you!</UTT>1
Hi how are you?</UTT>Great.  Who would think Trump's tariffs on China would help people who trade in knockoff designer bags?</UTT>last week we celebrated our family party</UTT>I know, not a designer kind of guy myself...

Hi, how are you?</UTT>Good!  You?   Do you like video games?</UTT>I'm good, thanks for asking.  I like video games, I started out playing on an old Atari 2600 system back in the day, that I still have in my closet!</UTT>That is so cool!  I have the NES sitting under my tv.  I loved the old school games!</UTT>Cool beans!  I hear that in South Korea it's illegal for kids under 16 to play video games after midnight.  Wow!</UTT>Taking things a bit extreme there.  I agree it isnt good for them to be up playing, but making it illegal...</UTT>Well, I would have probably been under the jail, because I know I played alot after midnight, when I was supposed to be sleeping!  lol</UTT>I liked sleep too much even then.  But I did spend many summers saving the princess.</UTT>Hey, I had the Pacman pattern memorized.  Do you watch NFL football?</UTT>Me too!  That game never ended though...  It just kept going.  I watch a little football.  You?</UTT>Yeah, but lately it's gotten boring.  That Super Bowl dragged on for what seemed like three hours.</UTT>Especially considering how little live action there is in a given game.</UTT>I read somewhere there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.  I knew there was alot of wasted time spent standing around, but come on.</UTT>I know.  It would be an interesting game on a running clock.  15 seconds max in between plays.  Like extreme football.</UTT>Or have a female player, that might make it more interesting to watch?</UTT>It would.  She would probably keep their egos in check too.</UTT>You're probably right! Well, I read there's no NFL rule against females.  I wonder why there is not at least a kicker, yet?</UTT>With how they are to the saints cheerleaders, I guess there is no rush.</UTT>That's pretty rough, from what I understand.  Can't eat at no restaurant where a NFL payer is at and if they are eating and one walks in they have to leave.  Wow, wonder what happened to prompt that rule?</UTT>I cant imagine it would be anything that you couldnt solve by talking to grown adults about it.</UTT>Well, I bet it's something juicy, for sure!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this evening.  Have a good night, friend!</UTT>1

Hello.  Probably this fact is before Trump, but the three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington and Jefferson</UTT>Hey, it takes a lot of money to get elected!  Campaigns are expensive.  Did you know up until 1905, the runner up would become Vice President?  I can imagine all the fighting that would have caused!</UTT>I heard about it.  Imagine if Hillary was Trump's VP.</UTT>I know, that would be crazy!  Did you know the President of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?  Can you imagine any of our current or former Presidents singing?? LOL</UTT>I also heard about it.  I hoped he did not ignore his main obligation - running the country.</UTT>Maybe he combined them.. turning political speeches into pop songs. Hehe!</UTT>About another foreign president:  The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana.</UTT>Wonder if that was his name or a title.  You know, like "Head Banana"  LOL.  Hey, speaking of music.. you go to many concerts?</UTT>In the past.  I have not had time lately.  I heard that LInkin Park played 342 concerts in 2001.</UTT>Yeah, wish I could have seen that!  Sadly, I don't think they're going to tour anymore with Bennington's death.  :(</UTT>I know.  It was sad.  Their debut album was so successful</UTT>Now you want to talk long concert runs, they say The Ramones have played 2,263 concerts for almost 20 years!  Now that's dedication!</UTT>That was a dedication, indeed.  An ancient roman amphitheatre in Croatia (former Yugoslavia) is still used for concerts.</UTT>Wow, I bet that would be awesome to attend a concert in a place like!  I think Pink Floyd once recorded a concert in an old amphitheater...</UTT>I heard about it.  Apparently, they had a live concert in the ancient place without any audience.</UTT>Huh... no audience?  Did they at least record it, I wonder?  Otherwise, seems like that would be a little pointless..</UTT>They might just make a music video or, perhaps it was to personally enjoy the ambience.</UTT>Speaking of concerts, they say a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band.  Can you imagine a concert THAT bad you get sued for it?  Wow...</UTT>I never heard that before.  How bad could it be?  I do not like people suing for every small thing.</UTT>Dunno, maybe if they had technical problems and the audience couldn't hear it very well.  Or one of the band members showed up drunk, I could definitely see suing for that reason...</UTT>You do not have to sue.  Just complain on social media - it would be enough.  I have never been a fan of Creed.  Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

Hi! Do you watch the Bachelor? I could watch it all day... it's so great how they always have a villian and drama</UTT>I never have, no. I can see how that's entertaining, but it kinda kills the idea that it's supposed to be "reality."</UTT>You just have to go in knowing that. I mean the fact that a 22 year old is trying to get a 36 year old is kind of crazy!</UTT>Yeah, I admit I was being a little assumptive. Is that even called reality TV anymore? I don't think anybody actually thinks of it that way. It's just manipulated drama.</UTT>I agree completely but I watch it for the drama honestly! For example, there is one girl who assumes everyone is jealous but really Arie doesnt like her.</UTT>Yeah, and it seems like they are very careful who they let on the show. Like, they want personalities that will clash, so that things like Krystal trashing the other girls will naturally happen.</UTT>They also plan dates that will bring out the drama. LIke they make the "wilderness" date which will bring out all the girls' discomfort.</UTT>I can see why. I wouldn't want to have to eat worms or drink urine, either.</UTT>ALso, the fact that Arie still gave Krystal a rose even though she's obviously attention seeking is clearly planned. I think they tell him who to pick, don't you?</UTT>That would not surprise me at all. I wouldn't be surprised to know that things like Krystal calling the others out for being insecure are coached, as well. They know how to get people to watch.</UTT>Very true. I think that they also try to get people engaged on social media. They always have people tweeting like @jordynhtaylor's tweet</UTT>Oh yeah, definitely. The fact that @kellykeegs is listed after her name in articles is even more evidence of that.</UTT>I will say Tia and Kendall being into the wild stuff in the wilderness was also very survivor-esque. It makes for good tv!!</UTT>Yeah, they may as well make the most of it. If you're gonna have to eat worms, why not at least try and enjoy it?</UTT>Yuck. I Will I admit that I do enjoy drama. I was pretty sad that Jim carrey won't do drama anymore. I love him!</UTT>I hadn't heard that! It is a shame. He's really good at it.</UTT>very different than the reality tv drama haha</UTT>Oh yeah, for sure. I just now learned that soap operas were called that because the shows were sponsored by soap manufacturers. That's funny.</UTT>That's soo interesting! I actually was interested to learn that drama came from so long ago-- ancient Greece!</UTT>It does have a pretty interesting past. Entertainment goes back a long way, really.</UTT>I also really enjoy drama in the theater. Doyou?</UTT>I do, yeah. I haven't been in a while, though.</UTT>Also did you know that there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of radio drama for FREE!!</UTT>I did not! I have listened to quite a few podcasts, which can be similar, I guess.</UTT>Absolutely , what genre of podcasts?</UTT>Usually comedy. Interviews, or just general talking shows with comedians.</UTT>I like them all as welL!!</UTT>1

Hello,  did you know the sun is actually white?</UTT>Hi! I wasn't aware of that but I do know that sunset on Mars is a blue color. I think that would be very interesting to see and beautiful!</UTT>Yeah that is interesting!</UTT>I also think it's interesting that the sun doesn't rotate as a solid body... and the equator actually rotates faster than the poles!</UTT>Same.  its also pretty crazy that a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the surface of the sun.</UTT>Is it really? I certainly don't want to be struck then. Ha! You know the sun makes up 99.86% of our solar system's mass? That's amazing!</UTT>That is amazing!  cant believe its that big!</UTT>I know, right? And on a related note, helium was the only element discovered on the sun before we discovered it on earth, believe it or not!</UTT>wow.  also, neptune completed its first orbit of the sun in 2011 since it was discovered in 1846.</UTT>That is amazing. I can't believe it took that long! There's actually a radio station that can translate solar activity into sound so you can listen to the sun's live music! I'm hoping to hear it someday!</UTT>Thats impressive,  I wonder if they actually release the station its on.</UTT>That is a good question. I love listening to the radio as it is, particularly politics. Speaking of politics, did you know Woodrow Wilson was the only president to have a PhD? Isn't that hard to believe?</UTT>That is hard to believe,  you would think more would have it.  I think he has a phd in political science.</UTT>I think so as well. But just as surprising, we haven't had a president speak a foreign language fluently since FDR. I always assumed all presidents could speak different languages.</UTT>I havent known any of our recent ones speak any.  yeah i think he spoke french and german!  Not positive though.</UTT>Maybe so! Can you also believe that Lincoln was the first president to be photographed at his inauguration and ironically, John Wilkes Booth was also in the photo? Weird, huh?</UTT>Damn,  Lincoln got photo bombed!  and by his assassinator,  creepy.</UTT>That is creepy, isn't it? So how would you feel if we implemented a law like Guatemala that didn't allow close relatives of former presidents to ever run as president?</UTT>It doesn't effect me at all.  I dont think I would vote for it though,  it makes sense that family members are immersed in the world of politics and can be a great candidate for the same position or in that vicinity.</UTT>Agreed. I honestly feel the exact same way! I often wonder if presidents have weird rituals like Darrell Green who would stuff tootsie rolls in his socks before games saying it made him run faster.</UTT>Oh wow,  why would that make him run faster lol Its been great chatting,  gotta run.</UTT>1

hi! do you like football?</UTT>Yea, I watch it all the time. I heard DJ Moore might get drafted by the Carolina Panthers</UTT>That is exciting to leave Maryland for him!</UTT>I hear Norv Turner is pretty impressed with Moore, he would probably be a good fit</UTT>I can't believe he had 30 other scouts looking at him!</UTT>Yea, Mel Kiper thinks Moore will go to Jacksonville at number 29</UTT>I think it is crazy that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>Yea I can see how theres only 11 minutes of gameplay in the nfl with how much time players take to get ready between plays</UTT>I also did not know that the nfl has no written rule against female players.</UTT>It will be interesting to see if there is every a female player as a place kicker since they can play by rule</UTT>That would be interesting. Did you know engineers have a higher average life long earning?</UTT>Yea, I can see how an engineer makes more lifetime than a nfl player since they have longer careers and less injuries</UTT>Yes, I wonder the average years an NFL player stays in the league.</UTT>Not as long as head coaches, Bill Belichick has been coaching so long he was the last head coach of the Browns to win a playoff game</UTT>That is a long time! I wonder his net worth.</UTT>I don't know but Belichick must have a lot of money after winning 21 postseason games as a coach</UTT>It is funny that the buffalo bills are equal to the patriots in super bowl losses</UTT>I find it funny Tom Brady's jv football team never started him despite not winning a game</UTT>I wonder how he improved so much.</UTT>I don't know but he is pretty smart, probably not as smart as Alex Smith who received his bachelor's degree in 2 years</UTT>Wow that is impressive. I wonder if he did it so fast so that he could go pro.</UTT>Well I got to go, nice chatting with you</UTT>1

I wonder his net worth.</UTT>Yea I can see how theres only 11 minutes of gameplay in the nfl with how much time players take to get ready between plays</UTT>I don't know but he is pretty smart, probably not as smart as Alex Smith who received his bachelor's degree in 2 years</UTT>That is exciting to leave Maryland for him!</UTT>I think it is crazy that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>Yea, I can see how an engineer makes more lifetime than a nfl player since they have longer careers and less injuries</UTT>hi! do you like football?</UTT>It is funny that the buffalo bills are equal to the patriots in super bowl losses</UTT>Not as long as head coaches, Bill Belichick has been coaching so long he was the last head coach of the Browns to win a playoff game</UTT>Wow that is impressive. I wonder if he did it so fast so that he could go pro.</UTT>0
Are you a football fan, I just moved to the Boston area four years ago so I got kind of sucked into that. Funny, the author of the Game of Thrones compares the Patriots to the Lannisters.</UTT>Lol, I am a Vikings fan. Patriots are a great team but I can see the resemblance lol!</UTT>I agree, my wife loves that show. Me, I'm average on it. I actually lived for 49 years in KC and had season tickets at Arrowhead so the Chiefs are my team. Ironic that Bill Bellichick won a playoff game as the Cleveland Browns head coach in 1995, and the Browns haven't won a playoff game since.</UTT>Wow, he is just a playoff winning coach. I think he is the most winningest coach in playoff history</UTT>I think you're correct, he is worshiped around here. I was a Fran Trakington (sp?) fan, but that will date me. You see where Gisele Bundchen doubles her husbands salary with her modeling earning, no ramen noodles in the Brady household.</UTT>lol that may date you, but you have all this experience and knowledge! I wouldn't work if my wife made that much lol</UTT>I agree, You see where Brady has that crazy diet that supposedly keeps him young and in shape, he's never eaten a strawberry in his life. Given his performance past 40 there might be something in that.</UTT>I wonder if he is allergic or something because strawberries are awesome! I heard he was a vegan</UTT>Yes, well he's doing something right, though ironically Belichick puts him on the injury report every week. Why do you think he does that?</UTT>I think that is so interesting, I never knew that. I bet it is to psych teams out to have to work on playing against Brady and the backup potentially, what do you think?</UTT>I agree, or so they'll never know if he's really injured. Did you read where the average NFL game only actually has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Given the violence and strenuousness of the game that may be a good thing for players bodies and better for commercials during the breaks.</UTT>For sure, I would have guessed a lot higher since games last like 3 hours, but for the safety of the players that is a good enough number</UTT>Did you know that the average Engineer makes more in his life time than the average NFL or MLB player, I guess all those whose career is shortened by injuries bring down the average from the big money players. I hope they have a good pension.</UTT>yea only a select few get that big paycheck. I bet these are the same engineers that make tracking chips that are in shoulder pads that track things</UTT>Yes, I read that. I can see why they track the bowl, but why do you think they track the players' equipment? Also, there's no rule against women playing in the league, I've seem some great women soccer players, you think there will ever be a female kicker?</UTT>I think there is a female kicker in the making. I just read an article the other day and it may happen sooner than later, that would be great i feel!</UTT>On the flip side of that, did you see where the New Orleans Saints don't allow their cheerleaders to dine at the same restaurant as the players? If they eating when a player enters they have to leave the restaurant immediately? That seem sexist and has the making of a law suit to me.</UTT>That is such sexism, I wonder what the other teams think of that or even if they know it is happening. Someone should speak up!</UTT>In this day and age I'm surprised someone hasn't or a crafty lawyer addressed that. My inlaws are from upstate New York, you see the Bills are equal to the Patriots in Super Bowl losses (kind of Ying and Yang in my wife's family), they suffer up there. I know a bunch of my wife's cousins who love Jim Kelly from the 4 Super Bowl loss run.</UTT>That was sad, they got 2nd place like so many years in a row I think. Kind of embarrassing, but also pretty cool they made it that far all the time. It was so nice chatting with you, go Brady!</UTT>Then again, my Chiefs last won when  Richard Nixon was President so we know disappointment too, but Patrick Mahomes has breathed hope back in the franchise. We actually went to our first game at Gillette out in Foxborough this year when the Chiefs-Patriots played and that was an amazing game in a loss.</UTT>yikes that is a long time. I think your chiefs will win it in the next 3 years. I am calling it! Have a great weekend!</UTT>1

hi did you know the president guest house is bigger than the white house?</UTT>No that's really wild. I wonder why that is? Did you know that the president of Zimbabwe is named President banana haha</UTT>Yeah thats a very unique name!</UTT>I saw that the president of Indonesia has released three pop albums. Do you think president banana has also done this?</UTT>Thats pretty awesome,  he must have a lot of time.  I wonder how many concerts he does.  I have no clue if President Banana has done this lol</UTT>LOL yeah I've never heard of him before either. Do you think we should go back to the old world where the runner-up of the presidential election would become the vice president?</UTT>maybe,  but not until Trump is out lol I dont think him and Hillary would make a good team</UTT>Nope at all. That is a recipe for massive drama. Do you listen to the radio by the way? Sometimes I listen to it on my way to work</UTT>Yes sometimes.  I usually listen to audio book or pandora though.</UTT>Yes I usually listen to YouTube myself. But I did hear that you can listen to a radio Storm from Jupiter. I think it's on the am Radio. I need to try that</UTT>That sounds really interesting!  There is a website you can listen to old classic radio dramas for free!</UTT>Wow Have you listened to it? Probably would like it myself. But say that you get what you pay for haha</UTT>I probably wouldnt listen to it to be honest.  I hear soldiers use to make radios out of a razor blade and a pencil.  thats so weird.</UTT>That is crazy. It was called The Foxhole radio. And I have no idea how it worked haha. I also wouldn't listen to a radio station that was broadcast in classical Latin haha</UTT>me either,  I dont speak latin,  but that is interesting.</UTT>What do you think about the government? I guess they try to destroy Wikileaks or something</UTT>Thats interesting.  I hear that the government owns 86% of Nevada.</UTT>Yep that's what I heard too. I also heard a guy tried to sell the Eiffel Tower twice. That is insane haha</UTT>That guy must be an amzing con artist lol</UTT>Oh totally. Speaking of something that is not a con, Norway gave over 1 billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest. That is super nice of them</UTT>That is really nice of them.  I really would like to visit norway one day!</UTT>I would too. The whole country seems like it's full of super nice people haha. Maybe I will see you there</UTT>1

I know Bruce Lee was a great dancer and he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship in 1958.</UTT>i cant say that im surprised. he must have had a great sense of rhythm. i bet he was a real ladies' man.</UTT>Yeah, I bet. Did you know ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week.</UTT>if i were a dancer, i would go through a dozen. LOL. i cannot dance. really.</UTT>Me too! Did you know Michael Jackson has a patent?</UTT>is that the patent on the shoes for that special lean? he really was a genius.</UTT>It was a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.</UTT>yeah, thats it! i was never any good at dancing. i wonder if you have to start when youre young.</UTT>Well, I know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Maybe the better dancers heard a lot of music when they were younger.</UTT>i wonder if i heard enough music. maybe that was it. maybe i missed by window. oh well.</UTT>Yeah, maybe. I know they smile more when they hit the bet.</UTT>I use smile when i hit a bet too. LOL i heard that tupac was a dancer back in high school.</UTT>Yeah, I think he danced in the Nutcracker in HS.</UTT>I bet he was really good too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground later on. by the way, are you a fan of snakes?</UTT>No. I'm not crazy about snakes. There's no snakes in New Zealand.</UTT>so ive heard. i guess i would move there if i had a phobia of snakes. i have never seen a flying snake. that would be frightening.</UTT>No, basically they;re legless lizards without limbs.</UTT>oh, ok. The fear of snakes is hard-wired  in human brains. i guess that makes sense. we needed it for evolution.</UTT>Yeah, can you believe that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to snakes.</UTT>i guess scales and feathers are analogous? i never know they were related. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Yeah, good talking with you too!</UTT>1

Do you listen to the Radio?</UTT>Yes, mostly on my commute to and from work every day.</UTT>Interesting, I have to ride the subway so I can't listen to it. I miss it though. Did you know you can make a radio out of a razor and pencil?</UTT>Oh, that's neat.  I heard that a Hanson song became the most requested track on a Chicago alternative rock radio station because the DJs did not reveal the name of the band.  Those are some talented brothers, they kind of got roped into being a teeny bopper band and never really shook that image.</UTT>Did you know that Hanson is from canada? I didn't.</UTT>Oh, cool.  Celine Dion, Shania Twain, and Hanson, all the Canada artists, I can think of. All good, though.  Did you know that the most popular radio act of the 1930s was a ventriloquist?  I don't even know how that was possible over the radio?</UTT>Interesting, I didn't know that. I wonder why people liked that.</UTT>Who knows, times were simpler back then.  Maybe people were more easily amosed. Lol</UTT>yeah. Did you know there is a website where you can listen to thousand of episodes of classic radio?</UTT>No, I didn't know that.  I'll have to check it out.  I do know that there is a radio station that translates the solar activity into sound so you can listen to the sun's music, live.  How cool is that?</UTT>It's pretty cool. Do you know if it is AM or FM radio?</UTT>It's an Am station out of Topeka, Kansas.  On a different note have you ever visited 1600 Pennsylvania avenue in Washington, D.C. ?</UTT>I have, I actually live in that area. Pretty cool stuff.</UTT>That's nice.  Did you know the very first phone number for the White House was"1"?</UTT>No, I didn't. That is crazy, I wonder how many prank calls they got!</UTT>Probably a plenty.  I hear there is a replica of the White House in Atlanta, which was built as a private home. Have you ever visited it?</UTT>No, but I've visited the real one. It is not nearly as big as you would think.</UTT>That's what I heard.  Most of it is below ground, I hear.  Do you know that Jimmy Carter installed solar panels, which Ronald Reagan promptly had removed, when he took office?</UTT>Interesting, and then George W put them back in.</UTT>To each his own I guess. Jimmy Carter also had all the thermostats turned down to 65 degrees the Winter of 1977.  Which, I was a little girl back then, but it was very cold.</UTT>Interesting, well nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

How cool is that?</UTT>Interesting, well nice chatting with you!</UTT>It's pretty cool. Do you know if it is AM or FM radio?</UTT>0
Do you think Trump should by buddying up to Kim Jong-un</UTT>No. I don't think he's trustworthy. Kim jong un has started to edit pictures to depict a different history just as previous communist leaders mao and stalin did.</UTT>He does have a degree in Physics and Military Studies</UTT>That's interesting. I read that no one knows how old he is. Bizarre!</UTT>I think him ordering the killing of his own family members is as cold as you can get.</UTT>Yes! And Trump decided to meet with him, the first meeting between a US President and North Korean leader.</UTT>I don't think Kim has any respect for him whatsoever. He had his half brother killed and uncle too so I doubt he has any admiration for Trump</UTT>I am sure there were many ulterior motives. I didn't realize he is the first North Korean leader to have been born after the country's founding</UTT>Yep and he is the first one to allow his country's participation in the olympics too but under a agreement with the South</UTT>Interesting! He and Trump meeting was to discuss the North Korean nuclear program.</UTT>I don't think he's going to give up his nuclear program. I think he'll use it as leverage for negotiations to get what he wants</UTT>I didn't realize he is called "The Marshall"</UTT>They are all made up names.</UTT>The satire group The Onion voted him Sexiest Man Alive. Haha</UTT>I think they were trolling him</UTT>There have been many famous meetings of international heads of state, which were have been called summits since 1955.</UTT>Trump is scheduled to have another Summit with Kim early next year</UTT>Oh boy! Spain is the only country that has been a permanent guest at every g20 summit.</UTT>Maybe they should think of uninviting Kim, Trump and Putin...lol</UTT>That would be interesting! During the brisbane g20 summit, when putin shook the canadian prime minister's hand, the latter said "i guess i'll shake your hand, but i have only one thing to say to you. you need to get out of ukraine."</UTT>It was uncomfortable to watch Putin give MBS that handshake at the last Summit</UTT>I didn't watch, thankfully! Nice chatting with you. Take care!</UTT>1

As is the most popular hat in the old west--not the cowboy hat as you might imagine---but the old Bowler hat!  I think society would be much friendlier if we all wore bowler hats!</UTT>They are all made up names.</UTT>It was uncomfortable to watch Putin give MBS that handshake at the last Summit</UTT>Maybe they should think of uninviting Kim, Trump and Putin...lol</UTT>0
Are you a football fan? There are variations including gaelic, australian, gridiron, and soccer.</UTT>hi how are you? I sometimes follow football. i usually watch the super bowl.</UTT>I love soccer. It is the biggest money maker of football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis, and hockey.</UTT>Yes, the world loves soccer. everyone can play it. men, women, big small, rich, poor. it is the most democratic sport.</UTT>Jon Stewart played soccer in college. He doesn't strike me as an athlete.</UTT>Now, no, he doesnt. but he is pretty thin. he has the build of a former soccer player. i used to play, but i dont look it now LOL</UTT>Have you ever played three team soccer? It sounds challenging.</UTT>What is that even? how does that work? why does it exist? how many referees are there? I have questions.</UTT>I have questions too! It seems odd. I assume it would still be on a rectangular field with goalies.</UTT>Yes, i guess. how many goals? one for each team? why is this game needed, and who plays it? and is there a video game version of it out there?</UTT>I assume there is written material on it. Reading is a great option for decoding symbols to gain meaning.</UTT>I try to read as much as possible. i enjoy reading. i find it an enjoyable way to pass the time. You?</UTT>I enjoy reading so much I have to speed read to get it all done. The world record is 4,700 words per minute. I'm not nearly that fast!</UTT>does it help much? i figure that i wouldnt retain much of what i read at that speed. i guess it is a good way to get familiar with material.</UTT>It's tough to have good comprehension. I'm not a fan of poetry. Seems like neither is CS tolkien since he held a "you laugh you lose" poetry competition with tolkien.</UTT>Tolkien and Lewis were great authors and had an appreciation of language. i would buy tickets to see that contest.</UTT>A moral panic spread in the 18th century because so many people read novels.</UTT>Novels were seen as the words of the devil! Poetry was seen as the source of higher thought and sublime morality!</UTT>I would like to learn how to read braille. What an amazing option for those that can't see.</UTT>Yes, the guy that invented it was quite young when he came up with it. I wonder how it works for Chinese readers. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Nice meeting you! Bye!</UTT>Yes, have a good night!</UTT>Bye!</UTT>1

Hello,  have you watched iron Man?</UTT>I have! It was great!</UTT>I agree!  I recently re watched it,  very funny too. I love the part where he is experimenting with the first suit he made and a lot goes wrong lol</UTT>LOL. Robert Downy Jr was an awesome choice to play Iron Man!</UTT>I read somewhere that Iron Man's suit is roughly about 450 pieces !  Crazy right!</UTT>That is insane. i wonder how many pieces to put on?</UTT>I have no clue!  lol Did you know JARVIS stands for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System?</UTT>i dont think i did. that makes sense though givien the technology in the movie and the exoskeleton suit</UTT>The actor who plays JARVIS,  Paul Bettany,  has never even seen Iron Man!  They paid him so much money to do it and he doesnt even care to see the movie lol</UTT>wow. thats interseting</UTT>The director chose to film in California because most of the super heroes takes place on the east coast!</UTT>Hmm...why is that? lol The director was Jon Favreau, right?</UTT>Right. I read that he did that because most of the super heroes take place in the east coast.</UTT>Was that the directors choice though? Or was it one of the writers? Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway were the writing teams I believe.</UTT>I read it was Jon Favreau's choice.  this film was in development for a long time,  like 13 years or something.</UTT>Holy Cow lol that is insane! And if i remember right, it came out in 2008. I don't remember what years the other ones came out. I wonder how long those were in development?</UTT>Yeah,  I think Iron Man was this first to release of the Marvel movies,  so they released after Iron Man.  I read somewhere Tom Cruise and Nicholas Cage were also considered to be Iron Man.</UTT>Yuck lol. That move would have been horrible I think. I just cant picture that lol.</UTT>Right!  lol Wouldve been totally different.</UTT>I wouldn't have even seen it lol. That would have gone on to ruin the avengers movies lol .</UTT>They probably wouldnt have made spin offs if Iron Man tanked in the box office! haha,  been good chatting.</UTT>1

Hi!  Waht do you know about Minecraft?</UTT>Well, I have heard that it is the third best selling game of all time.</UTT>Supposedly the minecraft world is bigger than Neptune.</UTT>That is incredible.  Is it a memory hog because of that?</UTT>It might be.  I know a lot of young kids are very into the game.</UTT>It seems to have a lot of options like exploration, resource gathering, crafting and compat.</UTT>They get to build a lot of things and have their own world.  Very creative.</UTT>It is 3D also.  I wonder if there is music.</UTT>I am not sure. Ive never played myself.</UTT>I heard something about a music festival called Coachella that actually had 2600 people attend.</UTT>I have heard of the festival, but Ive never been.</UTT>I don't know if it is a physical place or a place within the Minecraft game.  I guess I would have to do some reading to find out.  Do you enjoy reading?</UTT>I do.  It is my favorite way to pass the time.  Im really into non-fiction.</UTT>They say that only the best readers in the middle ages were capable of reading silently.</UTT>That is really neat, I never thought about that.</UTT>So, we would be really good readers if we lived 500 years ago.</UTT>True,   Have you read Enders Game?</UTT>No.  What can you tell me about it?</UTT>It is on a military reading list.  It is about a boy fighting an alien race in what he thinks is a game, but turns out to be a real war.</UTT>That is an interesting set-up.  Did you know that Louis Braille invented his system of reading and writing for the blind when he was only 15?</UTT>Wow.  That is awesome!  Well Ive got to go, Nice chat!</UTT>1

Hi, how are you?</UTT>Great, how about you? Did you know that dogs are not color blind? A lot of people think they are.</UTT>I thought they were too! Dogs can have 12 different blood types.</UTT>Wow, that's a lot of different blood types. Did you know that Google prefers dogs over cats? I guess it's in their code of conduct.</UTT>That's a company that I could work for! AOL was probably a cat company.</UTT>Ha, that's funny! Did you know the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana?</UTT>That is a weird nickname. I wonder if he got that in college...</UTT>Maybe so!  Did you know that panda researchers wear panda costumes to work?</UTT>That's weird. Istanbul has a vending machine for dogs! That's so kind.</UTT>What, that's crazy! Wonder how long they stay in there if no one buys them. Did you know the U.S. President's guest house is bigger than the White House?</UTT>That's gotta infuriate Trump. He doesn't seem like the type to tolerate that...</UTT>No kidding. The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office. Now that's something Trump hasn't done.</UTT>Up until 1805, the losing presidental candidate would become vice president. Can you imagine Hilary and trump working together?</UTT>I tend to think that would be a good thing. It would force them to work together and might not make the campaigns so cut throat.</UTT>It proabably would bring back some civility on the campaign trails. I am not looking forward to 2020. It's going to be a train wreck...</UTT>No kidding. There's a lack of viable candidates unfortunately. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing?</UTT>I did not. I can understand dogs knowing it but elephants? That's amazing!</UTT>And all this time I thought the elephants at the zoo were completely trained! Do you know what Pizzagate was?</UTT>I do! A far-fetched conspiracy theory! I wonder why Liz Crokin thinks it's true.</UTT>Implausible conspiracy theories!</UTT>Yup! Nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

Did you know Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth?</UTT>no that is wild, I see why they want to switch to all digital, also crazy that netflix and youtube together make up half of all internet traffic, I watch youtube all the time</UTT>That is also crazy. I didn't realize Reed Hastings was inspired to startup Netflix after racking up $40 in late fees on Apollo 13.</UTT>haha ya that is a wild thing, good movie though, sad that blockbuster didn't buy them when they had the chance</UTT>I agree. Crazy that Netflix is now worth $2 billion.</UTT>yup, they were offered to blockbuster for 50 million, thats quite a lot of value appreciation!</UTT>That is a very big jump in appreciation. Did you know that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee lol?</UTT>oh I did, they also do fantasy congress, people seem to do fantasy everything these days haha</UTT>lol that's hilarious. I only do fantasy football. What about you?</UTT>ya I only do fantasy football as well, ahve you read any books by Terry Pratchett btw? he writes fantasy novels</UTT>I have not read any books by him. Wonder if they are any good?</UTT>ya I don't know, I just know he was knighted for "services to literature" so hopefully they are really good</UTT>Interesting. Did you know a single fold in the brain makes the difference between reality and fantasy?</UTT>I didn't, would you ever check out that fantasy novel from that janitor in chicago, I guess it was like 15k pages haha</UTT>haha I think I would have to pass on that. Way too long for me.</UTT>yup, it could be amazing but it could also be that long and horrible haha</UTT>It was good talking to you!</UTT>1

do you know much about politics?</UTT>A fair amount. I'm a freelance writer and write mainly on political topics. How about you?</UTT>Nice. I know some stuff like how the president since 1853 has either been a republican or a democrat</UTT>Yeah, the Republican Party took the place of the Whig Party after it collapsed.</UTT>Yeah. Did you know that Reagan actually campaigned for democrats and railed againts high corporate profits?</UTT>I'd definitely like some background context for that, LOL.</UTT>I guess he was really against that and also for low wages too</UTT>That would be my guess, but I'm curious to nail down exactly when he complained about corporate profits.</UTT>Oh I am afraid I do not have all the details there. Do you know when the use red and blue colors started by both parties?</UTT>I remember all the drama over the election map in 2000 and how "Blue States" and "Red States" caught on, and journalists stuck with that assignment from then on. I think they used red and blue before that, but switched the assignment every four years.</UTT>Yeah always fun when the elections come around. On another topic, do you listen to the radio at all?</UTT>Not much, because the radio stopped working in my truck and I live in a place that's a radio dead zone except for one Top 40 station. I listen to a lot of music on YouTube. How about you?</UTT>Oh that is nice then. Yes I listen to the radio. Apparently you can catch Jupiter's storms in AM radio</UTT>I wonder what they sound like? I should see if there's a recording online.</UTT>Maybe there is. DO you know how soldiers made foxhole radios during WWII?</UTT>Not until just now. That sounds very creative -- like a MacGuyver trick.</UTT>Yeah it was creative, they used razorblades and pencils to make them</UTT>Did you ever try to make a crystal radio? I got a kit for Christmas once when I was a kid but couldn't put it together so it would work.</UTT>I have not but it sounds like fun. DO you ever listen to radio dramas?</UTT>My brother-in-law is a radio nostalgia fan and I've listened to some old recordings from his collection. What I really like are the comedies, like Lum &Abner. Ever heard of them?</UTT>I have not but maybe it is time I check them out. So nice chatting with you.</UTT>1
That would be my guess, but I'm curious to nail down exactly when he complained about corporate profits.</UTT>Yeah it was creative, they used razorblades and pencils to make them</UTT>I remember all the drama over the election map in 2000 and how "Blue States" and "Red States" caught on, and journalists stuck with that assignment from then on. I think they used red and blue before that, but switched the assignment every four years.</UTT>Nice. I know some stuff like how the president since 1853 has either been a republican or a democrat</UTT>Maybe there is. DO you know how soldiers made foxhole radios during WWII?</UTT>A fair amount. I'm a freelance writer and write mainly on political topics. How about you?</UTT>Good morning how are you doing?</UTT>Yeah, the Republican Party took the place of the Whig Party after it collapsed.</UTT>I'd definitely like some background context for that, LOL.</UTT>Yeah. Did you know that Reagan actually campaigned for democrats and railed againts high corporate profits?</UTT>Did you ever try to make a crystal radio? I got a kit for Christmas once when I was a kid but couldn't put it together so it would work.</UTT>Oh I am afraid I do not have all the details there. Do you know when the use red and blue colors started by both parties?</UTT>My brother-in-law is a radio nostalgia fan and I've listened to some old recordings from his collection. What I really like are the comedies, like Lum &Abner. Ever heard of them?</UTT>do you know much about politics?</UTT>I wonder what they sound like? I should see if there's a recording online.</UTT>I have not but maybe it is time I check them out. So nice chatting with you.</UTT>Not much, because the radio stopped working in my truck and I live in a place that's a radio dead zone except for one Top 40 station. I listen to a lot of music on YouTube. How about you?</UTT>Oh that is nice then. Yes I listen to the radio. Apparently you can catch Jupiter's storms in AM radio</UTT>Not until just now. That sounds very creative -- like a MacGuyver trick.</UTT>Yeah always fun when the elections come around. On another topic, do you listen to the radio at all?</UTT>I guess he was really against that and also for low wages too</UTT>0
Do you watch Fox News? I didn't know it was owned by Sean Hannity</UTT>Not usually.  I get my news on the internet.</UTT>Yeah me too, for the most part. I like the Skimm a lot, especially because it gives links to the longer articles on topics I'm interested in. Fox News is very supportive of conservative activism now.</UTT>I hear that IGN and fox news are owned by the same company.  That's cool.</UTT>Yeah IGN is a gaming website, right? That's interesting. And whatever Fox is doing, I guess it's working, because Fox News is watched more often than MSNBC and CNN combined!</UTT>Wow that is impressive.  Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons before.</UTT>That's so interesting, especially considering that the Simpsons is aired on Fox!</UTT>I know right,  and probably make them a lot of money!  Guess they didn't like them making fun of them.</UTT>If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen I guess! Did you know they actually discussed the possibility of creating a channel exclusively airing the Simpsons?</UTT>Oh wow,  that would be amazing,  but now that we have streaming it might not be profitable.  Maybe they should just allow streaming on their website.</UTT>Yeah agreed. I hate it when they only show a few recent episodes on major channels and you can't stream all the episodes. I wonder how often they make fun of the president on the Simpsons?</UTT>Haha there has to be someone out there who is counting.</UTT>Yeah definitely. There are so many random fun facts about the position of president. Did you know that everyone called the first president of Zimbabwe "President Banana"?!</UTT>It's not like they were making fun of him though, that was his last name.</UTT>I had no idea. Still, pretty interesting! Did you know that the vice president used to always be the runner-up of the presidential election until 1805?</UTT>yeah that would probably not fly now lol they would not be a good team.  I cant imagine them agreeing on anything.</UTT>Yeah, Clinton and Trump would be an atrocious combination. I wonder how that used to work out! I find it interesting that Trump is not one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents in US history.</UTT>Oh he's number 1 for sure,  he is far wealthier than any of our presidents.</UTT>I don't know if he is, I'm pretty sure it's JFK, Washington, and Jefferson! But who knows, I guess</UTT>Yeah he is!  I have looked it up a few times before.  I believe according to Google it was trump,  then Washington and then Jefferson.  I cant imagine it has changed in a few months lol</UTT>Yeah I'm sure not! Must be a mistake on my information source's part!</UTT>Maybe.  Anyways,  its been great talking to you!</UTT>1

Hello.  What do you think of Amazon?  Can you believe it's been around since 1994?</UTT>I love it!  It is crazy how it started as a book store and has developed to what it is today.  Jeff Bezos certainly has a great vision.</UTT>That's true.  I do wonder though why he built a clock into a mountain.  The clock should run for the next 10,000 years.</UTT>I think having something run that long would be a neat accomplishment, something that you create to exist long past your time.</UTT>I never thought about it like that.  You are right.  His employees are taken care of apparently too.  The warehouse workers get a good exercise every day. They work between 7 and 15 miles during their shift.</UTT>That is a crazy amount, those warehouses must be pretty big, a lot bigger than when the first items were sold for sure.  The first thing sold was 27.95 and the customer got a building named after him.</UTT>I wonder if he bought a book.  I heard that Amazon started out as an online bookstore.</UTT>They did.  They used to offer so many books then they would buy it and ship to the customer.  They then started keeping stock of popular books.</UTT>I like that they keep growing though. I mean, they started out selling books and now they have a division where they publish books.</UTT>They have even owned imdb since 1998.  Its is pretty crazy how a simple bookstore grew to where you can find anything.</UTT>So true.  Now, they are helping out at people's homes with Echo devices.  Basically they are causing people to contact them daily.</UTT>Yeah, and with those devices they can help people control their lives, like playing music, and even getting wired to a house.</UTT>Yes they can.  So you can use amazon to help with your life and then use them for entertainment. After all, they've now got their own film and tv studio.</UTT>Ive read the book that details Amazon's development as well as aspects o Bezos' life.  I believe it is called the Everything Store.  It is faciniating the processes they went through.  There was even a rare book that when people wanted to order they could only get through one place that had a 10 book minimum so they ordered that 1 and 9 books that were out of print.</UTT>Really?  I'd like to read both books.  I wonder if the reason Amazon started out as a book store was because reading requires creativity and critical analysis.  Seems like both would be essential to forming a great business.</UTT>I agree.  There are even books for reading on military lists, like Enders game.</UTT>I've heard about that!  Enders Game is a fantastic movie! I've never read the book though.  The more I think about it being required reading the more I think maybe I should.</UTT>Ive seen the movie and read the book, it is good</UTT>Does the movie do the book justice?</UTT>yes</UTT>I'll have to read it soon.  Starship Troopers is another on the military's required reading list.</UTT>1

hello, do you know who Stephen Curry is?</UTT>Yup the guys is a legend now in the NBA. Do you know why he signed with Under Armor?</UTT>I do not know about that actually. DO you know what his first name is?</UTT>Well it was because of a glitch that Nike kept on they PPP with the name of Kevin Durant in it</UTT>Oh I see, that is a big mistake on their behalf. He was born in the same place as LeBron</UTT>Nice, maybe there is something there that makes for great players.</UTT>It could be, that is in Ohio. Do you know who Reggie Miller is?</UTT>Hmm I am not sure actually. I know that Tim Duncan stayed in school and then went to the NBA</UTT>Good for him, he managed to do both well I guess. Reggie is a great player but was always under the shadow of his sister</UTT>Wow that must have been rough. Most NBA players file for bankruptcy after they retire, that is pretty sad</UTT>Yeah that sure is. The woman went on to break 8 national records. I guess talent runs in that family</UTT>Nice one. There was a coach who was fined just because he said there should not be any games played during Christmas</UTT>Hmmm did they really have to fine him though. Iverson on the other hand seems to be doing pretty well with a contract he signed with Rebook</UTT>Did not know he was signed with Rebook. must be a nice contract there.</UTT>It sure is, they pay him $800 000 every year until he is 55 and then a lump sum of 32 million</UTT>WOw the guy is good for life then. Do you ever follow the games of Golden State Warriors?</UTT>I know they played the home games in a cow palace because their arena was booked for other stuff in 1975</UTT>Wow, cool. Their star, Curry only made the highest 4th salary in the team</UTT>Interesting and yet he is the star He also partakes in a foundation that donates mosquito nets to Africa</UTT>That is very nice of him. The GSW are looking to move to San Francisco in 2019 for the season</UTT>Oh wow I wonder why though. They earned 12 million by losing 4 games inthe last season of the NBA</UTT>Wow so win or lose they are still making  money</UTT>1

Did you know that facebook's like button is illegal in part of germany?</UTT>what? really?</UTT>I know! It is surprising but true.  The german state of schleswig-holstein deems the like button illegal.</UTT>zuckerburg suffers from what?</UTT>Well i don't know but I think he suffers from some sort of color blindness.</UTT>he suffers from red-grenn colorblindness</UTT>I guess that explains why facebook is blue then. I always assumed it was just someone's favorite color.</UTT>Yah I was thinking the same.</UTT>So what do you think of google?  It's a pretty powerful search engine you know. One search requires more computing power than it took to take the astronauts to the moon back in the day.</UTT>It's really big and powerful system in the world</UTT>It truly is and then again it can be kind of simple. I always wondered how  google maps knows about traffic and I recently learned it is just by seeing how fast android phones are moving on the road.</UTT>When google went down to 40%</UTT>What about google going down to 40%?</UTT>on 2013 google went down for five minutes. When a big system went down it make a big changes</UTT>Oh I totally agree with you on that.  You know, Google seems like it's been with us forever but it was just founded in 1998.</UTT>Yes every one in world use google at least once a day. When you ask some one something like address, any doubts they say" Just google it"..</UTT>Google is a part of everyone's lives.  And to think it was just a couple of Ph.D. students at Stanford that started it all.</UTT>every big thing start with a small steps. like google, apple, facebook</UTT>Yep, facebook was started when Zuckerberg was in college too.</UTT>Nice talking...:) bye</UTT>Nice chatting with you as well.  If you have an iphone you have more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent by the way!</UTT>1

Hey!  Do you know why the drive thru was invented?</UTT>Hello there, I think it was back in the 70's, but I'm not sure.  Do you know?</UTT>It was, it was so soldiers could get food, they werent allowed to get out of the car in fatigues.</UTT>That is a very interesting fact, wasm</UTT>Cars sure have been around for a while. I dont know what I would do without mine.</UTT>Yeah they sure have, I think way back in 1886 the first car was made, do you know where?</UTT>I think it was actually Germany by Benz.  Then the Americans Mass produced them</UTT>Good call!  Yeah it was, and then old Ford started the mass production.</UTT>Cadillac was actually a french explorer, i didnt know that.</UTT>I didn't know that either, very interesting though.</UTT>Did you hear about the guy who beat 90,000 people in Gran Turismo</UTT>Holy cow, that is very impressive!  I wonder if they have one like that for FIFA?</UTT>I have never played either.  I hear FIFA is an incredible game though.  I have the NES, N64, and wii</UTT>That is awesome, I still have an original NES, I'll keep it for my nephews to play.</UTT>Me too.  I hooked it up the other day and played some duck hunt</UTT>That is very cool, I remember playing in my friend's basement firing at the screen.</UTT>On a totally different subject, did you know Pilgrim clothing was full color?</UTT>No I didn't know that, I would have guessed it would have been more plain.</UTT>The black and white was for formal occasions only.</UTT>Oh that is not what I have always thought, very interesting.</UTT>It is.  Great chat!  Have a great day!</UTT>1

Hi Do you like comedies?</UTT>I love comedies!</UTT>Me too!  Do you like Bill Murray?</UTT>I do like him, especially in Ghostbusters!</UTT>Yes!  He thinks that his Kung Fu Hustle is "The supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy".  I don't think I've ever seen it.</UTT>I haven't seen it either.  But I have seen Evan almighty and it is crazy that it has a budget of 200 million</UTT>Whew.  Probably for all the special animal effects.  lol  The Green Lantern was supposed to be a comedy starring Jack Black.  That probably would have been good.</UTT>I couldn't imagine it any other way that it was</UTT>I know.  I'm not sure why they changed it up.  Did you like 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv in the 1990s?</UTT>It was pretty good, but it preferred Friends</UTT>I liked Friends too along with Seinfeld and Frasier, which 3rd rock beat out all 3 of those shows in 1997 to win the Golden Globe for best comedy series!</UTT>Wow.  It has been 37 years since a comedy won best picture.</UTT>Crazy.  I was surprised to find out Comedy Central was created in 1989.  I don't remember seeing it until the mid 90s.</UTT>I probably wasn't allowed to watch it until the late 90's.  lol</UTT>lol  Nice.  They cancelled over 100 shows also since they were created.</UTT>Wow.  did you know Drew Carey served 8 years in the Marines?</UTT>I never knew that.  That's pretty neat.  He must be older than I thought he was.</UTT>It is claimed that that is where he jump started his comedy career.</UTT>That's interesting!  I loved the Drew Carey show.  I'm going to have the them song in my head now. lol  Do you know anyone that still has a rotary phone?</UTT>I don't, not a working one at least.</UTT>I haven't seen one in years now.  New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.</UTT>I didn't think about that.  Its been great chatting today, but I gotta run.  Have a great day!</UTT>Ok.  I have to get going too.  You also have a great day!</UTT>1

Hi, are you interested in the telephone, fantasy, or William Shakespeare?</UTT>I am addicted to my phone.</UTT>Aren't we all? Did you know that our telephones convert sound, mostly our voices, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another phone which reproduces the sounds to the receiving user?</UTT>Yes, It is crazy the things they can do also.  Like the iPhone has more computing power than the US icbm deterrent.</UTT>Isn't that something?  Also speaking of phones, did you know that it's impossible to separate two phone books that have their pages overlapped together?</UTT>I have heard that, but havent seen a phone book in ages.  If I do ever find two again, I am tempted to give it a go.</UTT>Ha, ha, ha, me too.  Did you know that the cables carrying the phone and internet data across the oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor?</UTT>Yeah, that must have taken a while to set down.</UTT>I agree. Another strange fact is that Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone!</UTT>That is pretty awesome.  I wonder how to get signed up for that one, Ill have to look into it.</UTT>Yes, that sounds kind of unusual to say the least but might be worth checking out.  Speaking of unusual, did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy?</UTT>That is pretty cool.  The brain certainly is complex.  There are so many fantasy leagues, even a spelling bee and congress!</UTT>Yes, and some people are fantastic with fantasy. Did you hear about a janitor from Chicago who wrote a fantasy manuscript that had over 15K pages and 300 water color illustrations?</UTT>Yeah, He called it in the realm of the unreal.  Too bad his genius couldnt be recognized while he was alive.</UTT>Boy, I'll say.  He wouldn't have had to be a janitor then.  He would have had a higher station in life like comedic fantasy author Terry Pratchett who was knighted for his</UTT>Service to literature.  I havent read any of his works, have you?</UTT>No, I haven't. But I did find out some interesting facts about literature, Shakespeare in particular.  Did you know that Shakespeare invented the names: Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia?</UTT>I didnt know that.  I knew about some of the phrases he used being still in use today, like wild-goose chase, and full circle.</UTT>Yes, and what about 'good riddance', 'in my heart of hearts', and 'break the ice'. Who would have figured that's where those sayings came from?</UTT>True, sometimes we use a phrase so much we forget about its origin.  Or even what it really means.</UTT>I do the same thing but I do wonder where those sayings came from sometimes.  Again, the 'devil incarnate'? I would have thought some writer on TV came up with that one but no, it was Shakespeare.</UTT>1

Do you follow American politics?</UTT>Some,  I am not surprised that the first phone number in the white house was 1. lol</UTT>It definitely helped people reach the White House the fastest. I am surprised they still use floppy disks for storage.</UTT>Yes, I know.. I was surprised with that. I didn't know there was a replica of the white house in Atlanta thats a private home.</UTT>It is a beautiful building but I never would have thought to replicate it.</UTT>I agree, Jimmy Carter turning down all the therostats to 65 must have saved on the heating bills. Its such a large house.</UTT>Yes it is and it has an even larger guest house!</UTT>lol, I heard that too! Its a good thing Fred Rogers went to the senate to fund the PBS programming. Healthy child development is so important.</UTT>I have watched the video of his testimony, it's very emotional. I'm glad the Senate listened to him and valued what he had to say.</UTT>I did too, Very interesting Such a nice man. I can't believe Strom Thurmond filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes on the senate floor.</UTT>That would be all over the news today, I wonder how much coverage it got back then.</UTT>Yes, nonstop. He must have been exhausted! Very good for Harry Truman saving the government $10-15 billion.</UTT>Yes, I wish the government cared more about saving money these days.</UTT>I agree, its way out of hand! Its too bad the first presidential photograph was with Lincoln and had to have John Wilkes Booth in it.</UTT>Yes but that makes the picture even more interesting, it adds a whole layer of history into it as well.</UTT>Really,How do you feel about the last president to speak a foreign language was FDR?</UTT>I think it's a shame but I also think that it is representative that a lot of Americans only speak one language.</UTT>That's is true. I am surprised the only US president with a PHD was Woodrow Wilson.</UTT>Yes that is a surprising fact, I wonder how many had law degrees instead?</UTT>Yes, I would think a lot of them! Have a great day! Good chat</UTT>You have a great day as well.</UTT>1

Hey how did You like the Green Lantern movie ?</UTT>Not as much as I liked Kiunka's four-song "Stay Up Late" EP</UTT>who's that ? Sorry I've never heard that song. What kind of music is it ?</UTT>Seattle quartet Kuinka plays an exuberant brand of pop music</UTT>oh ok. Sorry didn't hear that one.  Did You know that Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989 ?</UTT>That is quite a few.     I wonder how many referred to the joke of slipping on a banana peel?</UTT>lol...  yeah, going back to green lantern - originally it supposed to be a comedy ;) what...  superhero comic book as a comedy ? Do You see that ?</UTT>Maybe.   The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance</UTT>really ?

The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia</UTT>Yeah, I mean I've heard that, but WHO and HOW did a study on this ;) lol, or are these facts only based on a drawings in caves ;)</UTT>If nothing else, Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior</UTT>...and now we dress these majestic animals in Halloween costumes...  they probably regret that decision ;)</UTT>Perhaps, but dogs continue to perform many roles for humans.</UTT>My dogs perform holes in my backyard... :) and bark at my tenants even though they've known them for many years ;)</UTT>Spoiled then.    No hunting, herding or pulling loads for them!</UTT>I guess I did - I'm not a hunter - I couldn't kill an animal, doesn't matter how small... Maybe I'll buy some sheep for them to protect ;) You have dogs ?</UTT>Yes.    It has always amazed me how Dogs drink with the underside of their tongue</UTT>You got some weird dogs man... ;) kidding ;)</UTT>Perhaps so.     Thanks for the chat, man!</UTT>1

Good Morning! How are you today?</UTT>Super. What about you ?</UTT>Same here! Are you a fan of dogs?</UTT>Yes. But I love cars.</UTT>Oh cool. I can't believe cars were invented in 1886. I thought it was in the early 1900's.</UTT>In 20th century only cars come to human uses. Firstly for the Military uses next only for civilian uses.</UTT>They were rapidly adopted in the US, and it took longer in Western Europe to be accepted.</UTT>Yes. In US only large number of people have cars compare to other part of the world.</UTT>Did you know that the car brand cadillac was named after french explorer Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac who found Detroit?</UTT>Yes. In the middle century cars reached biggest change due to technology like navigation system, air conditioning and parking alarm.</UTT>That has been so nice! I remember having to get around without a navigation system, it was so hard! What kind of car do you own?</UTT>Hyundai. What about you ?</UTT>I own a Jeep. I think it's crazy how it is legal in South Africa to put flamethrowers on your car!</UTT>I think it's the way to protect the car. The cars are propelled through internal combustion engine which have fossil fuel to run, but it create so much pollution.</UTT>It really does! Did you know that some birds navigate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?</UTT>It is very interesting. There no trees or any building to have shelter.</UTT>I'm sure they find a way to make it work. Have you ever been to Australia? There are some neat birds there.</UTT>Crows is the most intelligent birds, and sometimes it imitating human speech. Do you know ?</UTT>That would be awesome to see! I know some birds like to mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. I bet that messes with people!</UTT>Surely. Parrot is also good and Pigeon race competition is held.</UTT>That would be fun to see! Anyways, it was great chatting, have a good day!</UTT>1

Hello, do you know much about the earth?</UTT>Not much, except that i live there...</UTT>Good enough. When earth was created apparently the day was only 5.5 hours</UTT>That would be crazy! How would one nap?</UTT>I know no time for nap. And 71% of the earth is covered in water</UTT>Wow! That seems like a lot. I wonder how much is salt water like in water world.</UTT>The majority of it. Sadly, 80% of the forests have been destroyed</UTT>That does make me sad. Teddy Roosevelt was a known conservationist. He made the National park and forest service.</UTT>Wow, goof for him.  Did you know earth will be helium free by the end of the century?</UTT>Is that a bad thing? Can we make it in a lab?  Can old shoes perform better than new shoes?</UTT>Yeah apparently shoes that date back to 5000 years ago are much stronger</UTT>Maybe those cobblers can make ballet shoes. They go through 4 pairs a week!</UTT>Yeah that is a lot of shoes. Do you know how the keep them smelling fresh?</UTT>Febreeze?</UTT>Hahaha yes great option. But also tea bags</UTT>can you imagine wheelbarrowing 32000 books at 85 years old?</UTT>No but I heard Gladstone did that. What an amazing man</UTT>I would just give up... There are more libraries than mcdonalds so that is a good start.</UTT>I like that fact a lot. Have you heard of the Library of Things?</UTT>No, I have not. What is it?</UTT>A library in Sacramento where you can borrow other stuff besides books. Nice chat :)</UTT>1

Hey, enjoy swimming?</UTT>I love going to the beach but not a strong swimmer.</UTT>Yeah me either. The US is really strong in swimming apparently worldwide. We've won the most gold medals.</UTT>Maybe it is because of the swimsuit. There was one banned in the 2008 olympics because it was won 94% of all races.</UTT>I wonder if it did all the swimming for them?</UTT>Funny. I would think that it was the type of material it was made of but I'm not sure.</UTT>The real test would be to bind their hands and legs and make them swim in it to see how they do, like a dolphin.</UTT>The front crawl is suppose to be the fastest and most efficient stroke.</UTT>It is for my kids who swim competitively. My oldest is also pretty good at the breast stroke.</UTT>I do the freestyle which means anything to keep me from drowning.</UTT>Apparently the front crawl was introduced by Native Americans to  the early Brits who came over.</UTT>I wouldn't have thought that the Brits would be swimmers. It is cold there.</UTT>They are sailors so they need to swim some time.  At cornell university all students have to take a basic swim test. I wonder if they can doggy paddle?</UTT>I'm sure they can doggy paddle. I like to float on my back mostly.</UTT>How about Football? A Fan?</UTT>I hadn't really watch football until I started dating my ex. He loves the Patriots.</UTT>Former Patriots running back Ben Jarvis has never fumbled the football. Pretty impressive.</UTT>That is wild. Must of had glue on his hands.</UTT>Hah! Something like that.</UTT>Something like that...lol...I wonder what it was?</UTT>Luck maybe.  Anyway nice chatting!</UTT>1

Did you know that a man in France tried to impersonate a government official, and sold the Eiffel Tower...not once, but TWICE!?</UTT>I believe it.</UTT>In 2008, the government of Norway donated a BILLION dollars to help save the Amazon Rainforest.  Way cool of them.</UTT>The Dutch are building a bus that travels at 160 mph. Why would anyone want to go that fast on a bus. The Norwegians are very concerned about the earth.</UTT>Wikileaks apparently published the government's plans to destroy, well, wikileaks. That didn't work out too well...</UTT>Wikileaks is good. The government is scared of them.</UTT>Follow sports? I didn't realize that in 39 of the 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or a basketball coach.</UTT>I am not really into sports but that does impress me. I hope they are worth it.</UTT>I also did not know until recently that the US Supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor, known as the "highest court in the land"</UTT>That's funny. Given the age of a lot of those Supremes, I wonder how often it gets used?</UTT>The inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only losing coach in the history of the University of Kansas. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction!</UTT>I wonder what prompted him to invent basketball and how he came up with all of the rules. He must have had some help.</UTT>One rule that was banned for over a decade was the dunk because of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dominant use of it.</UTT>I did not know that. Head coach Joanne Boyle led the University of Virginia quit her job to go to Senegal to finalize her daughter's adoption. I think that is really brave.</UTT>I believe her daughter attends kindergarten at the Charlottesville Day School, dances ballet and hip-hop, and plays the violin.</UTT>It's too bad that they have to travel back to Africa for this and that she lost her job. They may be there for a long time.</UTT>Boyle has kept her daughter in Virginia because she has feared for her daughter's health. As a parent, I totally get and understand that.</UTT>She's lucky she has her own family to help out. But I don't know what they will do if the adoption is stalled.</UTT>This is why she resigned as coach once her team got knocked out of the NCAA Division I Tournament.</UTT>Yes, this is more important to her.</UTT>Thankfully, she has support - her 82 year old mother and 5 siblings (4 brothers & a sister) as well as a very supportive community.</UTT>That's really a good thing for her.</UTT>Pleasure talking to you!</UTT>1

Way cool of them.</UTT>The Dutch are building a bus that travels at 160 mph. Why would anyone want to go that fast on a bus. The Norwegians are very concerned about the earth.</UTT>Wikileaks apparently published the government's plans to destroy, well, wikileaks. That didn't work out too well...</UTT>Wikileaks is good. The government is scared of them.</UTT>Follow sports? I didn't realize that in 39 of the 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or a basketball coach.</UTT>I am not really into sports but that does impress me. I hope they are worth it.</UTT>I also did not know until recently that the US Supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor, known as the "highest court in the land"</UTT>That's funny. Given the age of a lot of those Supremes, I wonder how often it gets used?</UTT>The inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only losing coach in the history of the University of Kansas. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction!</UTT>I wonder what prompted him to invent basketball and how he came up with all of the rules. He must have had some help.</UTT>One rule that was banned for over a decade was the dunk because of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dominant use of it.</UTT>I did not know that. Head coach Joanne Boyle led the University of Virginia quit her job to go to Senegal to finalize her daughter's adoption. I think that is really brave.</UTT>I believe her daughter attends kindergarten at the Charlottesville Day School, dances ballet and hip-hop, and plays the violin.</UTT>It's too bad that they have to travel back to Africa for this and that she lost her job. They may be there for a long time.</UTT>Boyle has kept her daughter in Virginia because she has feared for her daughter's health. As a parent, I totally get and understand that.</UTT>This is why she resigned as coach once her team got knocked out of the NCAA Division I Tournament.</UTT>Yes, this is more important to her.</UTT>Thankfully, she has support - her 82 year old mother and 5 siblings (4 brothers & a sister) as well as a very supportive community.</UTT>That's really a good thing for her.</UTT>Pleasure talking to you!</UTT>She's lucky she has her own family to help out. But I don't know what they will do if the adoption is stalled.</UTT>0
Hi, do you play any fantasy sport games?</UTT>I never have but I've heard that you can even play fantasy spelling bee! So I can't promise that some day I won't try it, in one way or another! Ha</UTT>I have heard that too. I like playing fantasy football each year, but that's about the only one I do.</UTT>It sounds like a really fun thing to do, I'm just mostly too busy for fun. :( Fantasy congress, is a thing too!</UTT>I agree. I can't believe people do fantasy congress. That is just funny.</UTT>I wonder what all other things people draft! Speaking of fantasy, a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving fantasy and reality! Yikes! Scary! Human's need to learn more about how fragile our bodies and especially our brains our, i think.</UTT>Wow that's very interesting. Very fragile brains. Terry Pratchett was knighted for his services to literature.</UTT>Oh wow! I wouldn't mind being Knighted! It's sounds so cool to me!</UTT>That does sound pretty cool. A comedian in Chicago wrote a 15,145 page fantasy manuscript one time.</UTT>Jeez, I hope the comedian got paid for that!</UTT>I hope so too! Do you like football?</UTT>I do like football! And soccer to a degree. But mostly football.</UTT>I do too. Do you like the quarterback position?</UTT>Yes I do! Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the nfl?</UTT>I did not know that. I do remember Vick being a lefty as well.</UTT>Oh really? Personally, I'd love to be ambidextrous!</UTT>That would be cool. Did you know Alex Smith took so many AP classes in high school that he was a junior when he started college?</UTT>No, I didn't know that! I think that it's good to keep up with education, no matter what other opportunities, on may have.</UTT>I agree. In the 1960's, top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL stars.</UTT>That's crazy! I've never bowled, ever!Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career. That's a great record to have!</UTT>I can't believe he never fumbled. Pretty crazy. Well, it's been real chatting with you. Have a good day.</UTT>1

How's it going? Do you like sports?</UTT>Pretty good.  You?  I do like sports.  I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up!</UTT>Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste.</UTT>No I didn't but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.</UTT>Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course.</UTT>Isn't Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess.</UTT>It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn't all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world.</UTT>I didn't know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I've believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers?</UTT>He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie? He must really love golf.</UTT>He really must and people must love him to allow it in his contracts!</UTT>Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? That's kind of weird.</UTT>It does sound weird.   Did you know that the ymca invented softball?</UTT>They also invented volleyball,softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball one though, pretty sure it was around before the YMCA, I could be wrong though.</UTT>I don't know. I heard somewhere that James Naismith invented basketball.  I'm not sure if he was with the ymca or not.</UTT>A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic, talk about a stroke of luck!</UTT>That is lucky!  You know, I've heard that baseball is super popular in Japan.  Over there they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime.</UTT>Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in.</UTT>No it really doesn't.  It's odd that's it's so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.</UTT>Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined.</UTT>I agree.  speaking of softball though, did you know that the longest game in college history lasted 31 innings?</UTT>Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.</UTT>1

Hey! How are you? Do you listen country music?</UTT>I'm good thanks for asking.  As a matter of fact I do listen to Country music.</UTT>I didn't know that there are only 2 African Americans in the hall of fame. But yes, it could be true.</UTT>Yes, I can think of Charley Pride, I'm not sure who the other person is.  Do you?</UTT>I was thinking about Charley Pride as well. It's quite obvious for me. But I have no idea who the second is. Btw, I've read opinion that country music needs more politics, not less. Do you agree with it?</UTT>No, I don't agree.  I just want to hear good music, not somebody's political views whether I agree with them or not.  JUST SING!</UTT>lol True! I agree with you. I always was thinking is country music is the best in terms of reflecting the United States. It's something special. Rock, pop, etc. are everywhere. But country music is trully American.</UTT>Did you know Country music was originally inspired and derived from Celtic music?</UTT>I knew that Celtic is part of it, but I had no idea about things like English ballads, for example. I even cannot imagine how it sounds.</UTT>The origins of Country music are the folk songs of working class Americans, who blended various different tunes, ballads,songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.</UTT>People in Texas will add "cowboy songs too" lol... Really nice mix!</UTT>True and don't forget Texas swing.  I love the subgenre, well.  On a side note, did you know the Fender Stratocaster was originally intended for Country music.  Isn't that hard to believe?</UTT>Yes, it's hard to believe. Just want to change topic if you don't mind... Do you watch TV?</UTT>No problem, I watch a little tv, as well.</UTT>I honestly even don't have TV home. All comes from laptop for me. Btw, I didn't know that Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.</UTT>No tv, that's kind of unusual, don't hear of that much.  Most people have at least 5 at home. Lol Yes, I can believe Fox News is very big, alot of people are sick of the anti Trump message that CNN and MSNBC spew continually.</UTT>True. My best friend has exactly 5 TV home as you said... I also didn't know that President Nixon had something to do with creation of Fox News. I didn't know that.</UTT>I din't realize that Tricky Dick had anything to do with the creation of Fox News, how interesting!</UTT>That's interesting. Well, it was to chat with you here. Have a good day!</UTT>I've enjoyed chatting with you, as well, friend.</UTT>Thanks.</UTT>1

Hi good morning! Have you seen the movie Incredibles?</UTT>I saw the first one, but not the second.  I liked it a lot.</UTT>Nice same with me. I hope to see the second one soon. Sarah Vowell, the voice of Violet, is predominantly a political commentator!</UTT>Its crazy when you recognize their voices from elsewhere.  Did you know the director voiced Edna Mode?</UTT>I agree. Oh wow I didn't know! I didn't know that the present day events of the incredibles are set in 1960's, I thought it was more modern.</UTT>Wow.  Ill have to watch it again to see if I can pick up on that.  I too thought it was modern.</UTT>Yeah. I like other forms of entertainment too. I used to love the original Nintendo and it was finally discontinued in 2003 in Japan.</UTT>That was the best gaming system ever.  I always loved mario  brothers, even if  it was in 54 colors.</UTT>Yeah totally agree. Entertainment was originally developed and existed in many forms and were even supported by Royal Courts so it was available to all citizens.</UTT>That is good.  Did you know that Ronald Reagan was once told he didnt look presidential enough?</UTT>Wow that is very ironic! Apparently the entertainment executive clearly didn't know what he was talking about!</UTT>But apparently Bill Nye looked like Steve Martin.  He won a look alike contest and that is what launched his fame.</UTT>Oh wow that is surprising! Do you like the comedy genere? I loved comedy central and it was made back in 1989!</UTT>Yeah, comedy is one of my favorites.  Comedy Central has cancelled 100 shows since then.  Obviously they know what works!</UTT>Wow yes they do. Chapelle show was one of my favorites. The green lantern film was originally going to star jack black. He is a funny guy that would have made it interesting!</UTT>It would, it probably would have been like a Deadpool like movie.</UTT>Yeah I loved that movie too. Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the best comedy achievement in the modern era...I haven't even seen it!</UTT>Neither have I, There are so many other things that I could think of that are likely funnier than that, but that's me.</UTT>Yeah agreed, there is a ton of content out there. Do you like political satire? It is different from a parody which critiques certain genres without actually condemning them.</UTT>I do enjoy political Satire.  I feel like on the current political scene it is just too easy.  There is so much to pick from, to do it with.</UTT>Yeah it's almost like the easy way out these days because like you said it's just too easy. Have a great day :)</UTT>1

Hello are you a fan of country music?</UTT>I cant honestly say that I am.  how about you?</UTT>It's ok.  I like the older country music.  Did you know that the Fender stratocaster was intended for country music?</UTT>Really?  That is pretty cool.  George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins.</UTT>That's a lot of cash between the two of them. lol  There are only 2 African Americans in the country music hall of fame.</UTT>I guess you dont see many African American country musicians.</UTT>I can only think of Charley Pride and Darius Rucker.</UTT>I dont think I would have even been able to name Charley Pride.</UTT>I only know his one song "Kiss an Angel Good Morning" because it was popular when I was a kid.  Henry Ford helped finance the popularization of country music due to his fears over the "urban decadence" of jazz music.  Wow.</UTT>That is kind of crazy, and somewhat racist.</UTT>I know right?  I never knew that about him.  Do you follow any celebrities?</UTT>I dont really, Id prefer to keep up with people making a contribution to society that isnt purely entertainment.</UTT>What about Sesame Street?  Carol Burnett was the first celebirty to appear on that show.</UTT>I loved it as a kid.  I still think it is great for kids.  Did she do the ear tugging thing then?</UTT>lol I remember that. Who knows?  Pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities.  I wonder what's in there that it's such a big secret? lol</UTT>I wonder if there is like a secret handshake to get in too?  It has to be pretty cool if it has become noteworthy.</UTT>That's funny!  ...and I guess so. lol  Judge Judy makes $123,00 per episode making her the highest paid celebrity only after LeBron James.  I've never even watched her show.</UTT>Never?!?!  It is classic trashy TV.  If you ever want a good laugh, check it out!</UTT>lol Robin Williams in Aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.  I had a good time chatting with you!</UTT>It was a very nice chat!  Have a fantastic night!</UTT>Have a good night too!</UTT>1

Did You know that there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have, and dogs can donate blood at dog blood drives ?</UTT>No i did not!  It's really cool, that Google is a dog company!</UTT>what does it mean "a dog company" ?</UTT>I would assume like they allow dogs at work?  Maybe because dogs can learn over a 1000 words?</UTT>Not sure how is that helping Google ;)</UTT>Moral is very important in any company!  Like in a car... for google, they have a self driving car that has an aggressive mode!</UTT>I would never trust a self driving technology... what is that aggressive mode ?</UTT>Self driving technology is scary! Not scary like a horror movie though!</UTT>...but I love driving by myself... don't You ?</UTT>oh yes... it's very therapeutic for me!  Love driving till i empty the tank then going to the gas station and getting the correct side because of the little arrow by the fuel gauge!</UTT>ha ! I hear You man ! I can't believe people would actually buy a car that drives for them...</UTT>Well, people are really lazy anymore these days! At least i don't live in ohio with a stupid law where you can't warm your car!</UTT>What do You mean ? Why can't You warm Your car ?</UTT>Don't know... you will have to ask Ohio...

Hi there! How's it going? Are you a baseball fan?</UTT>Hi. I'm doing very well thanks. I'm do watch baseball on occasion and I'm a casual fan.</UTT>Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here.</UTT>You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract.</UTT>Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract.</UTT>Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal.</UTT>By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though.</UTT>No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform.</UTT>That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland?</UTT>You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres.</UTT>That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It's not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey.</UTT>I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team?</UTT>They've been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It's funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed.</UTT>Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox</UTT>I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee's will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though.</UTT>I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees.</UTT>Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It's a really cool stadium.</UTT>I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing .</UTT>Well I don't know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years.</UTT>You're correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I'm not too sure about that.</UTT>I don't think they have the pitching yet. That's so important for winning the World Series. Anyway it was nice chatting with you, enjoy the rest of your day!</UTT>You're correct. It all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. I was very nice chatting with you today as well. Have a nice day!!!</UTT>Take care.</UTT>1

do you like the NFL?</UTT>Yes I do. Did you know that women can play too?</UTT>Yes there is no rule against them playing in there so they are good to try</UTT>Yes and if they quality then they will join the rest of the team</UTT>Yeah. Switching topics, the average gameplay is only 11 minutes.</UTT>I know and yet we are glued to the TV for hours during games</UTT>I know. Engineers make more than footballers too over the lifetime</UTT>Well they also have longer careers so maybe that helps a bit there</UTT>True good point. Did you hear of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?</UTT>Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players</UTT>yea and they also need to leave mid meal if they walk in</UTT>Yeah too bad it is still around. DO you like Brady?</UTT>I love him he is so good. He is popular but his wife seems to be more popular</UTT>Yes and she also makes double what he makes</UTT>Yeah. He is listed in the injury report every week by coach Belichick</UTT>Yeah. The guy has never had a strawberry in his life</UTT>Yeah strange but I guess he could also be allergic to them</UTT>Yeah that could be. He has either won or lost the super bowl with the patriots by 3 or 4 points</UTT>Yeah. Prior to 2007 he never threw 30 touchdown passes</UTT>Yeah and then had 50 after that. Nice chat tonight</UTT>Same here, have a good one</UTT>1

hey there, do you watch NBA?</UTT>Yes, I love to watch basketball.  How about you?</UTT>yes me too. how is your favorite player?</UTT>Cool, my all time favorite player is Kareem abdul -Jabbar.</UTT>is that the guy that got banned from using the dunk?</UTT>Yes, that was him.  The dunk was banned from college basketball for over a decade.  Too funny</UTT>I know, if they can handle it then let them. Do you know who invented basketball?</UTT>I believe that was James Naismith.</UTT>Yes. And he was also the only losing coach in the U of Kansas.</UTT>How ironic is that.  The only losing coach in the University of Kansas's history, but you invented the game.  Must have taken a lot of ribbing over that throughout the years.</UTT>Exactly. At least the coaches are the highest paid in many states</UTT>Not only the basketball coaches but football   coaches too.  Did you know that the Supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor, known as the " highest court in the land?"</UTT>I wonder if they use it a lot during their lunch breaks. Do you know what NZ basketball team are nicknamed?</UTT>Can you see Ruth Bader Ginsberg out on the court?  I heard it was the tall blacks, which is crazy.</UTT>Yes that is it. DO you know reggie miller?</UTT>Yes, he's a hall of Famer.</UTT>And apparently as good as he was, his sister was always better than him</UTT>That must have really sucked, big time.</UTT>Or maybe is was a push for him to keep trying to get better. Do you know ALlen Iverson?</UTT>Well, that's true too.  Yes, I know Allen Iverson, he was a good player.</UTT>True and he has a lifetime contract with Reebok. Nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

Good morning! Do you ever shop on Amazon?</UTT>Yes, I love it!  It was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994</UTT>Hard to believe it's been around so long! For some reason it feels new to me.  You know it started out as just a bookstore?</UTT>Really thats interesting.  The first customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him.</UTT>He's a lucky man! And a smart one for buying from what was an unknown company at the time that turned in to the powerhouse it is today.</UTT>did you know that the United States Postal Service has a contract with amazon to deliver packages on Sunday</UTT>I did know that and to me, it just says exactly how powerful amazon is.  As far as I know, they are the only company that has that contract.</UTT>I think so.  I also saw that the workers for Amazons warehouse walk b/t 7 and 15 miles each dday</UTT>Well that's a good thing. It's a great way to get exercise and make money at the same time!</UTT>LOL exactly.  Did you know that Amazon passed up Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States</UTT>I believe it. I shop at Walmart but I like to shop online.  Truth is, Amazon ships UPS and Walmart doesn't.  Amazon gets stuff to you in a day or so.  Walmart doesn't do that either.</UTT>Exactly I prefer Amazon.  I just do Walmart for groceries.  I saw that Amazon is the third most valuable public company in the United States.</UTT>I guess that Google and Facebook are probably the top two.  Amazon might just move up though. They've got their own film and tv studio now.</UTT>Actually I read that they are behind Apple and Microsoft.</UTT>Really?  Well I'm wrong lol!  Well still, they might move up anyways!</UTT>Yes, they might.  They are the largest internet company by revenue in the world</UTT>And right behind Alibaba in total sales.  I wonder if that's due to the population size of China.</UTT>It might be.  I also saw that after Walmart they are the largest employer in the United States.</UTT>What do you think about the cashless stores they are starting up?</UTT>Well I guess most people dont carry cash so it makes sense.  I was reading that IMBD has been owned by Amazon since 1998.  I didn't know that</UTT>I didn't know that either.  Sounds like amazon got into expanding early on. They were only a 4 year old business when they did that.  Well, I've got to go for a bit.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!</UTT>1

Greetings! I hope you are well. These readings were certainly interesting!</UTT>Hello, how are you?  Do you like to read?  To me, reading is a simple word but the scientific definition that I read from an article sounded complex.</UTT>Yeah, we don't have think about reading once we do it well, so it's kind of interesting to think about it. Are you an avid reader?</UTT>I used to but I have been busy with work, grand kids, etc.  Apparently, in the 18th century there was a moral panic because people began to enjoy reading novels.</UTT>Yeah, that cracks me up.  I also like the idea of CS Lewis JRR Tolkien having a "you laugh you lose" competition.  I used to be a real book nerd, but now I'm mostly reading on the internet.</UTT>I read mostly on the internet too.   Yes, I heard about CS Lewis and the competition your were talking about.</UTT>All the articles were interesting. I had no idea the Sun accounts for 99.86% of our solar system.  Our little planet is pretty insignificant.</UTT>It is scary, isn't it?  I did not know that the sun is actually white.  I thought it was yellow.</UTT>It would be amazing if we could capture the power of lightening bolts. Dr. Frankenstein had the right idea.</UTT>Apparently, they are hotter than the surface of the sun.  I always thought that the surface of the sun was the hottest thing in the universe.</UTT>Even scarier, the next biggest star is a billion times the size of our sun.</UTT>Our sun is so tiny.  I'm not going to think about it.  It's way to scary.</UTT>So</UTT>I think you were trying to say something.  Apparently professional soccer makes more money than football, baseball, golf, basketball, and hockey combined.  How can it be?</UTT>S</UTT>Hello, are you still there?</UTT>Yes, my text box keeps disappearing. Sorry about that! I was trying to ask if you're a soccer fan.</UTT>I'm more into football but I watched some games on tv with my boss.  He is from England.  I like it that soccer is less harmful to players than football.</UTT>I didn't grow up around soccer, so I never really became a fan. It didn't make it to my backwater Indiana town.</UTT>Mesut Ozil, A German soccer player, donated his EU300,000 victory bonus to pay for poor children's surgeries in Brazil.  It was very nice of him.</UTT>I guess that part about soccer making more money than any sport is true. Yet, I've never seen a pro game in the U.S.</UTT>I've got to run now.  It was nice chatting with you.  Have a good night.</UTT>1

Not Alec though. lol  Did you ever watch that 70s show?</UTT>I used to love watching that show, its on netflix and youtube still. Do you?</UTT>I did.  If you go on youtube you can find all 10 epiodes that the British remade of it called "Days Like These"</UTT>That is hilarious, that poor show! Almost like that 80s how that probably lasted that long too!</UTT>lol Nice.  Did you know that there is only 1 episode of the Simpsons where bart was neither mentioned or appears?</UTT>That is so crazy, also the simpsons sent south park flowers when they made their famous family guy episode. Good chatting with you!</UTT>I didn't know that they did that.  I'll have to look it up on youtube for sure!  ...and good to chat with you too!</UTT>Have a great weekend!</UTT>1

Do you follow the US senate?</UTT>I do somewhat.  I know that there is 100 US senators.  2 from each state.</UTT>Yeah, thats the  way it has been for a long time at least, the senate chamber is located in the capitol</UTT>Senator Strom Thurmond holds the record for the longest filibuster by a lone senator.  He stayed on the floor for an incredible 24 hours and 18 minutes non stop!</UTT>He does? that is an odd record lol, you know that the US senate used the same Gavel for almost 2 centuries until Nixon cracked it.</UTT>Wow.  That's a long run!  It must be in a museum somewhere.  The reason Harry Truman was selected to be vice president was because when he ran the senate "Truman committe", it found so much corruption and waste that he saved the govt 10 to 15 billion dollars!</UTT>I guess thats a great reason, b¿he undercovered a big secret, most would remain quiet</UTT>I agree.  Did you know that the only US president to have a PHD is Woodrow Wilson?  That kind of surprises me.</UTT>That is suprising, I would guess most former presidents had one,</UTT>Me too.  5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote.  Never quite understood why we don't use the popular vote.</UTT>Its a weird system, maybe that can be changed one day, just like back in 1805 the runner up of an election would become vice president</UTT>Could you imagine that happening now?  Trump and Hillary?  lol</UTT>That would be caos, nothing would get done.</UTT>It would be chaos. Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and John Wilkes Booth was in that photo.  I never knew that.  Creepy.</UTT>That is creepy considering he got shot by him later, did you kno wthe White House has two twin buildings!!</UTT>I know!  ..and I didn't know that about the buildings.  I wonder why?  I know the first phone of the White House was simply 1.</UTT>It was? I had no idea about that, well the White House sure has some curious and cool facts</UTT>It does!  Who knew?  lol  There is a replica of the White House in Atlanta which was built as a private home!</UTT>Really I heard about the ones in Ireland and France never knew there was in Atlanta as well,</UTT>I didn't know either!  Did you know you can mail a birth announcement to the White House and they'll send you a congratulations card back?  Wish I would have known that when my kids were born.  Neat.</UTT>Oh thats so cool, I will do that next time Im expecting a kid.</UTT>1

do you watch the NBA?</UTT>Yes I do. Do you like Tim Duncan?</UTT>I like him. DO you like Reggie Miller?</UTT>I do. Tim Duncan did not go to the NBA until he finished college</UTT>Nice, good kid. Miller was great but his sister was always better than him</UTT>Wow they must be a very talented family in the sports</UTT>Yes she once scored 105 points and broke 8 national records</UTT>Wow impressive, Most NBA players have financial difficulties though when they retire</UTT>That is unfortunate. Did you hear of the deal Iverson signed with Reebok?</UTT>Did not, did they make him a good offer?</UTT>Yes the guy is set for life, trust me. Do you like LeBron?</UTT>I do actually. Did you know he refused an offer from Reebok for $10 million when he was 18?</UTT>WOw how come ? He is going to be in the Space Jam movie sequel</UTT>Yes because he said Nike or Adidas will offer him more so he did not settle for that</UTT>Wow he knew his self worth did he get a better offer then?</UTT>Yes Nike offered him $90 million the next year</UTT>Nice, good deal then , Did you know he is the highest paid  celebrity?</UTT>Nice, he is involved in many things so I guess that makes sense</UTT>Yeah. He once raised $6 million when he televised the decision, it was all for charity</UTT>Nice. He was really hated in 2012 when he decided to join MIami Heats</UTT>Wow I guess people did not like him leaving his old team</UTT>1

Good morning, do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Hello there, I do listen to the radio, mostly when I am driving to and from work.  How about you?</UTT>I listen to satellite radio in the car, not so much the regular AM/FM anymore.</UTT>I have gone on a few road trips in cars where they had satellite radio, it is very cool, so many stations to choose from.</UTT>Yes it seems like they have a station for every type of music you could possibly want. I like the variety because you get tired of hearing the same songs over and over.</UTT>Yeah the variety is really good.  Did you know that in Canada, all music played over the radio has to be at least 40% Canadian bands and acts?</UTT>That's a great rule to help support local artists. I wonder who gets the job to monitor that?</UTT>I agree!  I don't know how much the Canadian public likes it, but it is really good for all those local bands.</UTT>I'm sure it's not even that noticeable because you don't really think of the nationality of the artists when you're listening to a song. There's a station in Finland that airs a weekly Latin news program.</UTT>That is true, I think a lot of the music I listen to doesn't come from the US.  And really thats pretty cool!</UTT>It's important to expose yourself to different cultures and music is an easy and fun way to do that. I know that I've enjoyed listening to a lot of acts from different parts of the world.</UTT>Very true again.  Do you know what soldiers used to call the small radios they would make during WWII?</UTT>No, it is really amazing at how a radio can be made out of the smallest and craziest items.</UTT>Yeah it sure is, I guess they were called, 'foxhole' radios if I'm correct.</UTT>They were made with bits of pencil and razors, it's very impressive that they made them in a way that they were functional.</UTT>Yeah it really was.  What is also impressive is the radio storms on the planet Jupiter.</UTT>I would love to hear what those sound like on the radio. I wonder if they sound similar to static?</UTT>I agree, I wonder if there is a site you have to go, or if there is a certain frequency you can tune in to hear that.</UTT>That's something I definitely intend to research. Do you listen to podcasts?</UTT>I have not gotten into podcasts yet, but would like to. Do you have any suggestions where to begin?</UTT>I listen to a few true crime podcasts and few interview based ones. I would recommend Stuff They Didn't Teach You and 99% Invisible. It was fun talking with you, have a great day!</UTT>1

Good afternoon! How are you today?</UTT>I'm good.  Thanks for asking and you?</UTT>very well thank you! I have heard a few interesting factoids as of late and would like to share with you some of them!! Do you know in south Africa it is legal to install flame throwers on your car to help prevent car-jackings?</UTT>Sounds cool, I'd like to mount some on my car for my daily commute in traffic.  Lol</UTT>That is funny, you must live in a big city with lots of traffic. Did you know that Mc Donalds opened the drive through in 1975 to accommodate soldiers that were not allowed to get our of their car because of their uniforms?</UTT>That was nice of them.  It transformed the fast food industry, for sure.  I wonder what the inventor of the modern car, Karl Benz would think of how his invention was being used?</UTT>I am sure it did as I too find myself some days not in uniform of any kind not wanting to get out of my car and find drive through much easier!  something else supposed to stand the test of time ( no pun intended there, lol)</UTT>True, I reda somewhere that Google's self driving cars have an " aggressive" mode.  That sounds kind of unsettling and unnerving to me.</UTT>Yea, that in it's self sounds scary! Whole new meaning to road rage if you ask me!!  I wonder how it would do on the autobaun ?</UTT>I heard when Audi entered the Indian market they had to create a new horn to withstand the constant use.  I can't even imagine.  I'd def need that flamethrower, I'd light them up!</UTT>Too funny! Some days are easier getting around than others that is for sure! I find it funny that a person beat 90,000 other players on a video game called Gran Turismo and became a race car driver as a result.</UTT>Hey, he's got some skills, that's alot of people.  I'll be glad when Winter is over, I live in Ohio and it's illegal to warm your car up here.Been freezing my ying yangs off here, lately!</UTT>So you cannot warm up your car, by sitting it with it running or turning it on and going back inside? That's crazy and totally understand but can't sympathize much as I am in Florida and it has been pretty warm here, it gets below 65 and I am freezing so I can't imagine your cold.</UTT>Well, it's cold by all means, I'm glad you're somewhere warm, my friend.</UTT>Thank you! I have lived in the North but was much younger when the bones could take it. I have not owned a good heavy winter coat in probably fifteen years now.</UTT>Oh, wow.  I'm going to go South when I retire.  Getting too old for this.  If I could be like that man in NewYork and find alot of classic cars in an old barn that are worth millions, I could get there sooner!</UTT>Probably have a better chance of winning the lottery to get here quicker, lol. I spend a lot of time at the beach reading. I have an Amazon Kindle I take as I don't have to worry about sand in the pages that way and if I finish a book there I am able to get another pretty quickly by downloading. Do you read often?</UTT>Yes, a s amatter of fact I do read quite a bit.  I find Amazon's new font called " Bookerly that was specifically designed to be easy to read on kindles,to be just that. Reading is a breeze.</UTT>Do you know Amazon's CEO built a clock into the side of a mountain that should run for more than 10 thousand years?</UTT>Wow, that's interesting.  Haven't heard that before. Founder Jeff Bezos is a billionaire, so anything is possible, I guess?</UTT>I feel Amazon has a dabble into most aspects of everyday living including Sundays as the have a contract with the USPS to deliver packages on Sundays! For one that likes to get mail, that makes me happy.</UTT>I've heard that before, but I have never gotten a package on a Sunday.  Well, anyway, it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon, friend.  Get out and enjoy your Florida sunshine and know that I'm jealous!  Enjoy the rest of your day.</UTT>1

Did you know that Mc Donalds opened the drive through in 1975 to accommodate soldiers that were not allowed to get our of their car because of their uniforms?</UTT>Wow that doesn't sound fair, some people have a fear of water. The US has just as many gold medals as the rest of the world combined in swimming.</UTT>I am sure it did as I too find myself some days not in uniform of any kind not wanting to get out of my car and find drive through much easier!  something else supposed to stand the test of time ( no pun intended there, lol)</UTT>True, I reda somewhere that Google's self driving cars have an " aggressive" mode.

Hi, do you like comedy?</UTT>I do!  Did you know that Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern comedy age!</UTT>I love Bill Murray, but I'm not too sure about his opinion on Kung Fu Hustle. Have you seen that movie?</UTT>I haven't seen it.  I take that it isn't too good?  lol</UTT>It wasn't very funny I don't think. Did you know Jack Black was originally going to be in the Green Lantern film?</UTT>I saw that.  I think it would have been really fun with him in it!</UTT>Me too. Did you know comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989?</UTT>I didn't know that.  Did you like 30rd Rock from the Sun?</UTT>I do like it. I saw that it beat out Seinfeld, Frasier, and Friends for a Golden Globe once.</UTT>Yes.  Do you like listening to albums?  I started listening to them in the 1970's but stopped once cassettes came along.</UTT>I love listening to albums. Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album is the best selling of the 21st century.</UTT>I always wondered what the biggest selling album was since the turn of the century.</UTT>There are two identical twins in Japan that released a rap album at 100 years old.</UTT>That is sweet.  What a way to celebrate!  NWA's Straight Outta Compton was the first album to reach platinum status without the support of airplay or a major tour!</UTT>That's pretty cool! Do you know much about Earth?</UTT>The Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago.</UTT>Wow that's a long time ago. More than 80% of the Earth's forests have been destoyed.</UTT>That's sad.  Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century.  I bet Buck Rodgers didn't see that coming.</UTT>That's scary. I wonder what impact that will have other than filling up balloons?</UTT>I'm not sure what will happen.  When Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long.</UTT>That's a very short day. Well, it was good talking to you!</UTT>1

Good morning. How are you? Don't you just love the Internet? It is actually addictive with measurable changes in the brain.</UTT>Based on that little bit of info I'm not sure that I do love it.  Not sure I could without the internet though.</UTT>Yes it is very important. It carries a vast range of information from documents and applications to electronic mail and file sharing.</UTT>When using the internet I find myself on Youtube most often, watching more videos than I really should</UTT>I love youtube. Created back in 2005 it wasn't always so big but sure is now!</UTT>I guess it's the whole thing of having videos on demand.  I even find myself watching concert on Youtube.</UTT>Oh nice I've never watched a concert on YouTube. Although I did watch Justin Bieber's baby video on YouTube and it is the most dislike video on there.</UTT>I suspect that is more to do with people being jealous of his popularity than a dislike of that individual video, I seen far worse than that.</UTT>True. I was surprised to hear that YouTube is the second largest search engine on the net, I wonder what the first one is? Google?</UTT>I would assume you a right there.  There seems little you can't find on Youtube now, I wonder just how many cats videos have been uploaded to it now.</UTT>Yes cat videos are definitely more popular than dog videos! Police actually have their own YouTube called blue tube.</UTT>Never heard of that one, can't be that popular.  I typically stick to music videos, and concerts.  I rarely get to go to concerts so Youtube is the next best thing.</UTT>Concerts are a lot of fun. I prefer the smaller concerts and nightclub as opposed to big arenas or large parks. It is more intimate.</UTT>I totally agree.  It's nice to get up close to the person or band you want to see rather than being hundreds of feet away.</UTT>Exactly. In Croatia there is an ancient Roman amphitheater that is still in use as a concert venue. That would be a cool place to see a concert.</UTT>Yes, there are some really cool places that bands have played in the past.  I not sure how I feel about paying money to watch a hologram sing though.</UTT>Yeah I probably wouldn't want to pay money for that either it's basically watching a concert on the screen. The Ramon's played a total of 2263 concerts. They toured almost nonstop for 20 years. Must've been very tiring.</UTT>That's a lot of shows.  It's impressive for people but not holograms.  You would ave to just press the repeat button and it would keep on playing night after night.  Could play in multiple places at once too.</UTT>Yes that's a good point I bet that will happen more in the future. Did you hear about the Creed concert in 2002?</UTT>Is that the one where people sued to get their money back.  Maybe Creed should just make a hologram of their best concert and replay it and not take the chance of upsetting their fans.</UTT>Yes it must have been a bad concert! Not like The Ramones or Linkin Park! Well it was great talking to you this morning!</UTT>Same here.  I'll be logging into Youtube to see if I can find that Creed concert and see how bad it was.  Good bye.</UTT>Yes definitely! Have a good one.</UTT>1

I love working on my computer.  I got my first one back in the late 70s</UTT>I got mine sometime in the late 90s! I was in grade school and it was exciting to own one. The first computer algorithm was written by Ada Lovelace.</UTT>Yes Ada did a lot.  I was lucky we never smoked - it would have voided the warrenty on our macs.</UTT>Around the time my family got their first computer, Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed piece of software. The first was Doom. I'm pretty sure I had 98 though.</UTT>Nice.  Did you know that someone once built a working computer using the building blocks of minecraft?  crazy</UTT>I didn't know that and that's very interesting. The first Google compute at Stanford was housed in custom made enclosures made from Legos.</UTT>I love Legos!  The Russians even made one out of water - I have no idea how!</UTT>I love Legos too! And how did they accomplish that? I have to look into it. I just learned that CAPTCHA actually stands for something- completely automated public tuning test to tell computers & humans apart! That's a mouthful.</UTT>Wow that is a mouthful.  Maybe I should just upload my mind to my Mac like the transhumanists want to do</UTT>That would help me remember things! Radios are amazing technology too. There's a radio station that translates solar activity into sound, so you can listen to music from the sun.</UTT>That is cool.  I was surprised to learn that Jupiter has radio storms so loud you can pick them up on AM radio</UTT>That's amazing. Did you know Bill Murray voiced Fantastic Four's Human Torch in the 70s?</UTT>No I had never heard of that.  I knew soldiers in WWII made radios using a razorblade and a pencil - very creative</UTT>That's extremely resourceful. a song by Hanson became the most requested song on a radio station because the DJs didn't reveal the artist! ha those are the Mmmbop guys.</UTT>Smart djs!  I love going to the website where I can listen to old classic radio dramas for free.  War of the worlds is a great one</UTT>Oh yeah that's the one where listens who tuned in late thought aliens were actually attacking the Earth right?</UTT>Thats the one!  A big deal!  Sounds a lot better than the finish station which broadcasts in Latin</UTT>I meant "listeners," sorry. It must have been really believable! One of the most popular radio acts was actually a ventriloquist in the 30s.</UTT>A ventriloquist?  On radio?  That is unique..  I wonder if he was Canadian - their stations have to have at least 40% of music be canadian</UTT>Yep, that fact even baffles contemporary critics. I'm a big fan of poetry and there's a 274 line poem called Chaos because there are 800 irregularly pronounced English words.</UTT>Wow!  That is insane.  That is a lot of words.</UTT>1

hi, do you like reading?</UTT>Yes, Reading makes our brain more active.</UTT>yup for sure, do you ever go on wikipedia?</UTT>Yes, Reading is a means for language sharing information and ideas.</UTT>yeah, in wiki they have superheroes ranked according to their powers</UTT>The reading process requires continuous practice, development and taking notes about the subject. It is easy to remember.</UTT>do you know who wrote the oldest known cybord in a fiction?</UTT>No, Its good exercise to brain and now days, reading habit is much reduced. please all in social media.</UTT>have you read starship trooper?</UTT>Yes. Its very interesting.</UTT>do you go to concerts?</UTT>Yes, A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience.</UTT>have you been to any?</UTT>I went to shakira. She dance very beautifully.</UTT>nice. do you know the ramones?</UTT>Yes, The American punk rock brand.</UTT>yeah, do you know how many years they toured for?</UTT>May be 20 years.</UTT>yeah and in that time they had 2263 concerts</UTT>Its very interesting.</UTT>Yeah. nice chatting with you</UTT>1

Hi, how are you? Have you seen the movie Incredibles II?</UTT>Hello!  I have!  Good sequel to the orginal one that came out in 2004.  Did you see it?</UTT>No, I didn't. Interesting choices for voice talent though. Edna Mode, the superhero costume designer in The Incredibles, is voiced by Brad Bird, the film's director. Bird voiced Edna during storyboarding sessions, after which the production team couldn't find an actress who could do the voice better than him.</UTT>Neat story!  The girl who played the voice of Violet is Sarah Vowell.  She's also a bestselling author of historical nonfiction!</UTT>Quite a talented person! The present day events of the Incredibles are set in the 1960s. That’s a great period for clothing and architecture.</UTT>I agree.  I like finding vintage items from that era.  When they were making the movie the directer used artists that he thought were either likely to quit or get fired from Pixar.  He must have thought they would have extra motivation to produce better work so they could save their jobs?</UTT>That would be my guess. He knows quality. I also figure they invest a lot in the scripts and casting because so much has to go into the animating.</UTT>Yes.  I didn't realize that there was actually a sequel that came out in video game form called "The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer".  Did you ever hear of that?</UTT>No, I haven't. I guess people just couldn't wait for the movie. For marketing, it’s better to strike while the iron is hot.</UTT>Yes.  Speaking of video games...did you ever have a Nintendo back in the day?</UTT>No, I did not. I played video games as kid, but not NES.. Now, I don't have the time.</UTT>I don't have the time either.  The original system could display only 54 colors.</UTT>The NES was all about great game play.It  was finally discontinued in September of 2003 in Japan.</UTT>I lost interest and time in the mid90s somewhere.  Did you know that Ronald Reagan was once turned down for a movie role because he didn't fit the look of a president for the role?  How ironic.</UTT>I wonder what the presidential look was back in those days. Maybe he needed better makeup. LOL</UTT>LOL  Do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?</UTT>Yes, I do. He's great! Good ambassador to science.</UTT>Yes!  He was discovered by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest!</UTT>That's great! The man has varied talent. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day!</UTT>You have a good day as well!  It was a pleasure!  One more quick question before we go.  Do you like comedies by any chance?</UTT>Yes, I do like comedies. They are funny, and so am I. So we get along very well.</UTT>Awesome!  I love them too!  Have a great day!</UTT>1

I find the idea that universes evolve through natural selection fascinating. I guess this refers to the idea of a multiverse that's constantly percolating new universes out?</UTT>Yes I think so. The universe sure is interesting.</UTT>Yeah, I've seen dumbed-down explanations of physicists' theories in pop science journals' saying that each one of those new universes that pops out as a big bang or while hole has its own laws, and the ones with laws that function well give birth to new universes on a similar pattern</UTT>Yeah sorry my last response was cut off early haha. But yes the universe is super interesting, and I even saw there is a theory that we exist inside a black hole. I wonder how that would even work</UTT>Same. Unfortunately my hard science education was lacking. One of these days I intend to read all the major popularized works on modern physics (Dancing Wu Li Masters, Tao of Physics, etc.) so I can at least get the Sunday supplement version.</UTT>Haha that's a good idea. Did you hear that there may be a parallel universe? There's a cold spot in the microwave background that scientists detected in space, and they think there's a parallel universe in there. I wonder if I will ever meet my parallel self haha</UTT>Wild. I never saw that. I love alternate history science fiction though. Do you?</UTT>I do like alternate history stuff, I think it's very fascinating. How many times have you ever folded a piece of paper in half? Apparently 103 is the maximum amount of times that anyone could do it</UTT>I've never tried. I wonder if it wouldn't depend on the size of the paper you started with, though?</UTT>I don't think so. I think it's just an overall rule. Have you ever played a video game before?</UTT>Long, long ago -- like in the Pac Man and Space Invaders era. I never saw the appeal to be honest. How about you?</UTT>I used to play a lot of video games. But I don't really anymore. I played a lot when I was a kid. For instance I played the N64 game GoldenEye. Apparently a lot of the developers of that game that never even worked on a game before</UTT>When was that?</UTT>I think it came out in like 1997. I don't know if you ever play the N64 but it was a great system. Have you ever heard of the Mortal Kombat games</UTT>I've heard of them and vaguely recall there being a movie based on them.</UTT>Yep there's a movie and a whole bunch of games. The first movie is good but the second one is horrible. I never really played the games, but they were very violent and they are the reason for the rating system that we currently have in video games</UTT>Wow -- I should google that. Reminds me of how the comics code came about in the 50s.</UTT>Yep it's the same kind of idea actually. And I know that Australia bans a lot of games. Which I think is funny, because they ban more games than even China</UTT>I wonder how it is in the EU.</UTT>The EU also bans stuff, or they at least sensor games but not as badly as Australia. Have you ever been to a Chuck-E-Cheese before?</UTT>Never ate there -- I remember when they were called Showbiz and they had the hillbilly bears</UTT>1

Hello there, are you a fan of the Nintendo system?</UTT>Hey.  I had one about 30 years ago if that counts lol.  Are you?</UTT>Yeah that does, I had a best friend who had one back then as well, so I basically had one as well.</UTT>Did you ever have an atari?</UTT>No, but we had an Ntelevision I think it was called, it was the cheaper version I think. How about you?</UTT>Yep, I sure did.  The games were very simple but a lot of fun.  Apparently, there is an Atari video game landfill.  A documentary is being made about it</UTT>That would probably be very interesting to watch.  I remember getting countless hours of fun out of that old system with my older brother and sister.</UTT>I didn't know this: The NFL is recognized as an entertainment business rather than a sport, just like the wwe.  I wonder why?</UTT>That is very interesting, I wonder why?  Sounds kind of fishy to me, like they control who will be winning or something?</UTT>Right!  It's all staged like wrestling lol.</UTT>Exactly! Oh man I don't think certain fans like the Saints fans would want to hear something like that!</UTT>Nope, they sure wouldn't want to hear that.  There would be riots!</UTT>Yeah there would, there would be people trying to sue them because they spent money on tickets or hotels or something like that I'm sure.</UTT>Totally agree.  Ever watch horror films? Not a single person involved with filming the Exorcist thought it was a horror film.  What did they think they were making lol</UTT>I do like to watch them, and really!?  That is just too funny, yeah I wonder what kind of movie they thought they were doing?</UTT>Yeah, maybe they thought it was a documentary or something lol.  Horror movies can be a lot of fun to watch.</UTT>Yeah you might be right, and did you read how many calories you can burn just by watching them?</UTT>No, I didn't.  But that's a killer workout!</UTT>Yeah it is, just by watching lol.</UTT>I never saw Inception, but that was supposed to be a horror film originally</UTT>That is crazy, that movie is just crazy in general.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day.</UTT>1

Do you like youtube?</UTT>I'm on it quite a lot.  My kids still like Psy's Gangnam Style video.  So weird.</UTT>lol what a great dance! I heard that song almost broke youtube!</UTT>Can't believe how popular that was.  My daughter's also a Justin Bieber fan.  I'm unfortunately am not so we get into arguments sometimes about what she's watching.</UTT>lol I disliked that video when it came out, I am with a lot of people because that is the most disliked video on youtube lol</UTT>You're talking about Bieber's song "baby?"   Yeah, I didn't like that song either.  I've been trying to find older albums on youtube.  Stuff like Linkin Park or Reel Big Fish.</UTT>yea, terrible song lol. I loved Linkin Park, especially Hybrid Theory</UTT>I heard it's the best-selling album of the 21st century.  You listen to anything in particular?</UTT>Just rock and some rap here and there. How about you</UTT>Been trying to revisit some older rap groups.  I was pretty square in my younger days so didn't listen to it much.  Was told NWA's Straight Outta Compton is a classic.</UTT>I loved NWA's straight outta compton, nothing better than being a high schooler back in the day bumping that lol! They went platinum</UTT>Yeah, didn't know how well that album did.  I used to like beatboxers.  Always found that fascinating, how they could create all those rhythms without any accompaniment.</UTT>for sure, I practiced that and got decent at it and busted it out sometimes at parties lol. Did you ever hear about the twins from japan who released an album at 100?</UTT>That sounds awesome.  I've got to look that up.  Seem like it of "cultural significance" for many cultures!  I think rap's even pretty big in Korea.</UTT>I heard about Korean rap, they have rap battles that are compliment battles. I would like to see that</UTT>That sounds cool.  Guess rap is a legitimate form of music.  I know my dad hated it.  But hey, the Library of Congress seems to think it's a worthy art form.  Think they deemed Tupac's music as culturally significant.</UTT>That is a good feat by Tupac, making rap music significant. My dad hated it too lol. Did you ever watch the rugrats movie, Busta Rhyme was the voice of Reptar</UTT>Really? That was the dinosaur thing right?  Kind of "bad boy." Speaking of which, isn't that the name of P. Diddy's record label?  Sorry like I said, I'm pretty square.</UTT>Yea lol, the dinosaur. I think it is lol, bad boy records. It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>Nice chatting with you as well.  Gonna go look up some LL Cool J and Run DMC now.  Take care.</UTT>I will too! loved those rappers! Enjoy your weekend!</UTT>1

Hey how are you doing, you a big Natalie Portman fan?</UTT>Hi! Hope you're doing well!  I am a huge fan of Natalie Portman! But I am surprised that she was upstaged by Raffey Cassidy in Vox Lux. I've never even heard of the young actress! What about you?</UTT>I've never heard of her either, I'm sure she's got to be good to upstage Natalie Portman. Very cool. What is Vox Lux? Is it a movie?</UTT>It is an R rated film that I've heard is disappointing. Unfortunately, they say it doesn't really have the energy to say anything interesting or really anything that makes sense, which is disappointing!</UTT>For sure for sure. You listen to a lot of music by chance too? Either in person at a concert or download and buy albums?</UTT>I actually love the album Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park! In fact, it is the best selling album of the 21st century and I can see why because it's so amazing! What about you?</UTT>It's a fun album, I definitely listened to it a lot in the mid 2000s, I think that is when it first came out. NWA was a great group too, the movie was really good.</UTT>Agreed. Did you also know Straight Out Of Compton was the first album to hit platinum status despite no airplay support or major tours? That is really impressive!</UTT>Wow, definitely really impressive, especially with the challenges they faced. Reel Big Fish re-recorded all their hits for an album, I never knew people liked them that much. Do you like them></UTT>I didn't know people liked them either as I had never heard of them. Can you believe The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of best selling albums in 2014 despite being released over 40 years ago? That goes to show good music never dies!</UTT>Oh wow, that's crazy. I wonder if it won any of the other years in between?  Wonder if Judge Judy bought it with her money she makes !</UTT>Ha! She could afford several albums making $123k per episode, couldn't she? Crazy to think she's the highest paid celebrity, second to LeBron!</UTT>Oh wow, I really didn't know that. LeBron is about to be a billionaire, that's crazy, happy for him!</UTT>Indeed. He deserves it! I wonder if he's visited Pixar's secret room that celebrities often visit?</UTT>Me too, I wish I could go see it. It'd be cool to just see the celebrities there haha.</UTT>No kidding! Ha! I tell you something I would have like to have seen in person is that concert Creed put on back in 2002 that was so godawful, a few fans in attendance actually filed a lawsuit against Creed. I can't imagine a concert being that bad. Ha!</UTT>Haha, I can't remember being at that bad of a concert. Pink Floyd played in 1972 to the ancient roman amphiteather, that'd have been wild.</UTT>Agreed it would have! Another one that would have been wild to see was The Ramones while they played a grand total of 2,263 concerts almost nonstop over the course of 20 years!</UTT>Oh wow, I wonder how they got the "energy" to do all that lol.</UTT>Thats a good question as it had to take a serious toll on them! Just like Linkin Park, I wonder where they got the energy to play 324 concerts in a single year back in 2001?  Of course, it was due to the success of their debut album, so perhaps they were motivated by success!</UTT>Oh wow, that's nuts. I'm going to take off though, great chatting with you! Take care!</UTT>1
hey ! how is it going tonight ?</UTT>Hi! Hope you're doing well!  I am a huge fan of Natalie Portman! But I am surprised that she was upstaged by Raffey Cassidy in Vox Lux. I've never even heard of the young actress! What about you?</UTT>I've never heard of her either, I'm sure she's got to be good to upstage Natalie Portman. Very cool. What is Vox Lux? Is it a movie?</UTT>It is an R rated film that I've heard is disappointing. Unfortunately, they say it doesn't really have the energy to say anything interesting or really anything that makes sense, which is disappointing!</UTT>For sure for sure. You listen to a lot of music by chance too? Either in person at a concert or download and buy albums?</UTT>I actually love the album Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park! In fact, it is the best selling album of the 21st century and I can see why because it's so amazing! What about you?</UTT>It's a fun album, I definitely listened to it a lot in the mid 2000s, I think that is when it first came out. NWA was a great group too, the movie was really good.</UTT>Agreed. Did you also know Straight Out Of Compton was the first album to hit platinum status despite no airplay support or major tours? That is really impressive!</UTT>Wow, definitely really impressive, especially with the challenges they faced. Reel Big Fish re-recorded all their hits for an album, I never knew people liked them that much. Do you like them></UTT>I didn't know people liked them either as I had never heard of them.

Hello there, do you like Netflix?</UTT>Hi! I love Netflix! I wonder if they have that new tv show called Grownish on it?</UTT>Oh actually I do not know but it is such a convenience nowadays. Do you know how it came about?</UTT>I believe they were a rental service? And then expanded to streaming content.</UTT>Yeah, the founder was mad that he had to pay a late fee at blockbuster</UTT>oh, YES! I remember that story, I heard it on my telephone radio one day while driving in my car.</UTT>Nice. Did you know Blockbuster could have bought it back then and did not</UTT>I did hear about that, declining several offers! Silly choice! Now Netflix is worth 2 billion!</UTT>Yeah that is true. Yet though they still spend more on postage than on bandwidth</UTT>That's just crazy! But what isn;t crazy these days. Like it is impossible to separate 2 old phone books, a bit of trivia!</UTT>Yeah that is actually quite funny. Did you ever use a rotary phone?</UTT>I actually used a rotary phone growing up, I am so happy they have new technology!</UTT>Yeah for sure. They are the reason why NY's area code is 212</UTT>Cool! Didn't know that one. I still find it fascinating that we can talk to each other through electronic signals transmitted through wire....so weird when you really think about it.</UTT>It is indeed. And there miles upon miles of those cables in the bottom of the ocean</UTT>I heard that, the telephone is so awesome. I remember when we would laugh about it when people said, one day we will be able to see each other while talking on the phone....never thought it would happen.</UTT>Yeah we have come a long way for sure. Unicef donated clean water when we don't use the phones</UTT>That is amazing! I need to check and see if Netflix has the spin off shows they have been coming out with lately, I want to see A Different World, and so many others.</UTT>Yeah there is a lot there to see really. Do you have an adnroid or an iphone?</UTT>I only use an Android. I tried the iPhone...not for me lol plus too expensive. I would rather have a better car than put too much money into phones and save the money lol</UTT>Yeah me too. Nice chatting with you :)</UTT>1

do you know much about planets?</UTT>I do. Did you know JUpiter has a moon that if orbited the sun would be a planet?</UTT>yes that would be Ganymede, pretty cool</UTT>Yeah=. Did you know that Venus does not tilt?</UTT>Yes and that is why it does now have any seasons</UTT>Yeah and also it is the only one that rotates clockwise</UTT>Yeah. There is another planet where it rains shards of glass</UTT>Yeah and that is at speeds of 4500 mph in 2000 degrees fahrenheit</UTT>Yeah Did you know they have found building blocks of life in another planet?</UTT>ye and that is really far from here, some 455 light years away</UTT>Yeah. Did you know Uranus rotates sideways?</UTT>yes and it rolls instead or rotating around the sun</UTT>Yeah.  Do you like reading?</UTT>I love it a lot actually, and you?</UTT>Me too. Did you read starship troopers?</UTT>Yes and it is good. it is also recommended by military branches</UTT>Yeah same with Ender's game, military loves that too</UTT>Right. Do you know who holds the record of speed reading?</UTT>That would be Anne Jones at 4700 words per minute</UTT>Yeah. Did you know in the 18th century there was moral panic because people were reading novels?</UTT>Yes and now we have the opposite panic, for the opposite reason</UTT>Yeah sadly. Do you know who Tolkien and CS Lewis were?</UTT>1

Hello, are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>I am, to a certain degree, yes. You? It's all been kind of driving me nuts lately, but somehow I have been able to survive.</UTT>I try to find humor in it! I take joy in the fact that Trump isn't one of the three wealthiest presidents of all time for example.</UTT>What! That's insane! How is that possible? I thought he was good at was being super duper filthy rich. !!</UTT>I'm sure they measure for inflation! Anyways I think other presidents seem to have priorities other than politics too, like the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Now that is hilarious for sure! Trump should do the same, maybe he can make more money and rank top 3 riches presidents finally! Do you use FaceBook at all?</UTT>Ahah I'm sure people would rather him never sing. And I do! Why do you ask?</UTT>I was just reading about Facebook. Interesting that Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook. I'm sure they regret that. But who can know what websites are going to become huge or flop! I don't use facebook, likely due to lack of friends. lol</UTT>Oh that is interesting! And now look how far they've come. It's interesting how other companies do the opposite, and instead of engaging with Facebook they go against them. I remember Burger King had a promotion where you got a free Whopper by unfriending 10 people.</UTT>Haha what is up with that! Burger Kind has an agenda! Yeah, interested to see how Facebook ends up. There was a time I never thought I'd see the end of Myspace!</UTT>I wonder if we'll ever see the end of Facebook, a lot of places don't see it too favorably. For some reason, Facebook's like button is illegal in a part of Germany.</UTT>Oh wow! Maybe that's why they added other options... At least I noticed my brother doing a smiley face instead of a like, I believe. I just found out that Mark Zuckerberg made facebook blue, because he suffers from red-green blindness! crazy!</UTT>I didn't know that's why Facebook is blue! I'm sure other colorblind folk appreciate it too haha. And that's true Facebook is becoming even bigger in other areas, I heard Iceland is actually rewriting their constitution and using Facebook to get the public to make suggestions.</UTT>Oh wow! I wouldn't like having to join just to make suggestions. But I'm sure they have other means of getting suggestions. At least I hope so. Actually I appreciate the blue as well. Not that I use facebook, I just appreciate blue! :) Time flies! Facebook was created in 2004!</UTT>Wow time really does fly, I guess Facebook came right before YouTube in 2005 then, they're both so old now. Are you a big fan of YouTube too?</UTT>Oh I love youtube! What a great website! You can learn so much there, or create videos to teach others and maybe earn some ad revenue at the same time! Truly a great website!</UTT>I think it's very useful too! Especially with the things it inspires, like there's a YouTube-esque site for police called "Blutube", for sharing law enforcement videos.</UTT>Oh I've heard about blutube! I've been meaning to check it out! Youtube is huge! I mean, wow, the second largest search engine! Easy to believe since I'm always watching youtube!</UTT>Yeah it's crazy how much the biggest sites leave their mark on the Internet. I think Netflix and Youtube combines make up half of peak Internet traffic in North America.</UTT>Two of my most favorite websites! Sometimes I use both websites at the same time! Fun fact! Justin Beibers "baby" song is the most disliked video on youtube!</UTT>See, for all the positivity YouTube inspires there's still a lot of hate on it, guess you have to see the best of both sides. Anyways it was very nice chatting with you tonight, have a great night!</UTT>I agree! People can be pretty mean sometimes! And Ditto! It was wonderful chatting with you as well!</UTT>Absolutely haha, take care!</UTT>1

One day I hope to visit Japan, I will make sure I take lots of extra money with me.</UTT>Yup do that for sure. And if you go to Iceland make sure you rent a car there or just fly a lot</UTT>Did you know the dutch creating a commuter bus designed to travel 160 mph? I don't think I want to travel on a bus with that king of speed?</UTT>I actually want to try that. Do you know who the first king to travel the world was?</UTT>Yes If I am right, the first king name Kalakaua, I didn't know there are kings in hawaii, guess I never thought about it.</UTT>Yeah me either but so cool of him. How about tv, do you watch much?</UTT>Yes, when I am not working I watch TV in the livingroom and sometime when i am lying in bed. I try to watch news every night.</UTT>Oh cool.

Hello,  how are you doing? Chinese american james wong howe was an oscar-winning cinematographer who pioneered the use of wide-angle lenses, low-key lighting, crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography. he was not an american citizen until 1943 and his marriage with a white woman was illegal until 1948 due to racism.</UTT>That's interesting. No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography.</UTT>Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself. even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick.</UTT>Too funny! Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won.</UTT>Wow,  thats tough! Gavin free, known for rooster teeth and achievement hunter on youtube, also worked on the slow motion cinematography for hot fuzz, sherlock holmes: a game of shadows, and dredd</UTT>Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won.</UTT>yeah,  I think you just told me that.  Too bad for him.  which movies was he apart of?</UTT>I'm not sure. Are movies your favorite form of entertainment? Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.</UTT>Yes,  I watch a lot of movies!  When caesar visited britain, around 50bc, he noted that its people bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment</UTT>That's interesting. Bill nye "the science guy" got his break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest.</UTT>He really does look like Steve martin. The nintendo entertainment system was finally discontinued in september of 2003 in japan.</UTT>Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures.</UTT>Ronald reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment executive didn't think he had "that presidential look."</UTT>Haha. Guess he showed that exec! Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures</UTT>Thats interesting.</UTT>Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognizable and familiar..</UTT>Cool. The nintendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors.</UTT>I didn't know that! Early forms of entertainment were supported in royal courts.</UTT>nice!  Do you like animals? There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.</UTT>That's amazing. There are 1.5 million living species, but 1 million of them are insects!</UTT>nice talking to you.</UTT>1

I am not a Facebook fan. How about you? Its amazing how big it has vgrown since it's origin in 2004.</UTT>I'm pretty indifferent to facebook even though I've been on it on and off since it was founded in like 2004</UTT>I am also not a fan of the founder, Zuckerberg. you?</UTT>No, I don't like his philosophy of removing anonymousy off the internet nor letting 13 year olds have a facebook profile</UTT>legal maneuvers, i suppose. Funny how you rarely hear about the other co-founders.</UTT>Yea his rommates Saverin, McCollum, Moskovitz, and Hughes; they made a movie about facebook that said there was disagreements and I've heard Zuckerburg at least screwed over one of them</UTT>And still people, like sheep, trust that they can share their personal info on the Facebook platform without concerns. Since the founders all started out as students at Harvard, I wonder how many graduated...</UTT>I don't know, but facebook is worth 104 billion now so I guess it doesn't matter too much</UTT>Right. :Sorry for not graduating Mo,. but here is a house for you." Today, Facebook makes most of it's money from advertisements, and screwiing with elections. LOL</UTT>Too bad myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook, I liked myspace a lot better when I was in high school</UTT>My dog had a MtSpace page. Maybe you were Myspace friends... Apparently my dog did not help them earn enough money to afford to write a check for $75 million..</UTT>Maybe, dogs do have constitutionally guaranteed legal rights in Germany</UTT>The German Shepherd dog lobby is strong in Germany. But this does not explain how the Loch Ness monster was granted status as s protected species. Although there are a lot of monsters in politics.</UTT>There's also a lot of insects in politics too, and 1 million species of them too</UTT>All polititians are animals. 20 quantrillion animal species on earth, and most of them live in my back yard.</UTT>I only really care about the domesticated ones so I guess if they don't have a white patch on their foreheads I don't care about them</UTT>I have a cat named, "Spot" because she has a white spot on her face, but she is far from domesticated. Must be another holdover from evolution, like hiccups.</UTT>I wonder why that's why people say to drink water when you have the hiccups, something to do with use to having gills</UTT>Right. Another evolutionary quandry...is the guitarist from the band, "Muse" who hols the record for smashing more guitars while on tour than anyone else.</UTT>Matthew Bellamy? That's a pretty cool world record to have</UTT>Sure. I wonder if Bellamy ever set speakers on fire like Eddie Van Halen did while recording a solo for "beat it"?</UTT>I don't know, the both of them should team up with Brain May and find something crazy to do with May's astrophysics knowledge</UTT>Where are all the normal guitarists these days? Maybe they are all held hostage on the floating recorning studio that Pink Floyd has on the river Thames...</UTT>Lol, maybe. Well it was nice chatting with you</UTT>1

Well, that was weird. My articles just switched to basketball</UTT>Mine always were.  Did you see how judge Judy's pay compares to Lebron's</UTT>yes, but considering the size of here syndication area, it makes sense,</UTT>Yep.  Lebron certainly deserves his pay.</UTT>People who complain about their salaries don't take into account how many people can watch them and how much money the networks and teams make off of their talents.</UTT>Exactly! The multiplier is the thing.  I started a company selling directory assistance calls to AT&T at less than 25 cents apiece.  However, we sold over 50 million such calls per month.</UTT>My dad was a Yankee before I was born. I've never understood why this concept does not sink in with some people. These people deserve it- lebron james' high school basketball games would attract 1750 attendees. tickets cost between $100 - $120.</UTT>I agree.  The challenge in life is to find the enterprise that gives one the benefit from the "multiplier".  Jordan was smart enough to turn down $10 million for shoes and later received $90 million from another company.</UTT>Lebron James, and one reason he's so successful is that he understands this, his worth.</UTT>No doubt about it.  I suppose he may have an agent who helps with that strategy.  Did you notice that the US Supreme Court has a basketball court on the top floor known as "The Highest Court in the Land?"</UTT>That's funny. Like how The new zealand basketball team are nicknamed the "tall blacks"</UTT>I wonder what the derivation of that name really is.  Also, the dunk being banned for 10 years.  I think it took that long to figure out how to build a backboard that won't shatter.</UTT>It was a joke referring to their famous rugby team The All Blacks.</UTT>I see.  That is somewhat of a relief.  I agree with coaches of football or basketball being highly paid.  They bring in the revenue.</UTT>Yeah, I think anyone who contributes to a successful team should be paid very well.</UTT>It is back to that multiplier thing.  How much revenue does the sport bring in and how much less would it be with a bad coach?</UTT>And that's why bad coaches get fired very quickly.</UTT>Sure is.  It is simple economics.  Few of us work in jobs where our financial contribution is so visible.</UTT>Though this is a bad stat: In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.</UTT>I read that.  I think it is an okay stat.  The governor of a state does not impact the income like a coach does.  I am originally from Oklahoma and our college football has been pretty important for years.</UTT>Depends on the state, I'm from NJ but live now in NY. It isn't that important here.</UTT>I understand that.  Well, Panda is calling.  Nice talking with you.</UTT>1

Hi! Do you like baseball?</UTT>yeah we can talk about baseball, who's your team?</UTT>I do not have a specific team. How about you?</UTT>yeah me either, I like the rockies because they are close and fun to go see</UTT>Very cool. Do you know why managers wear uniforms?</UTT>yeah I saw that, crazy right? can you imagine them playing? too funny</UTT>Yes, I always thought it was odd that they wore uniforms. But now it makes sense that it it because they can play.</UTT>Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in canada? kickball was fun as a kid</UTT>I used to love kickball. It makes sense because it is a mixture of those sports but it is easier to keep it just one word.</UTT>yeah always fun! Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's status as America's national pastime?</UTT>I wonder why they are surprised that it is popular here. It is americas favorite past time.</UTT>yeah, they are crazy about baseball. heading there in May</UTT>That is very exciting. Maybe you will be able to watch a game. Do you know who schedules the games?</UTT>maybe I'll have to introduce them to kickball. No, who schedules the games? ;)</UTT>Up until 2005 it was a married couple for 24 years!</UTT>Now it's probably some lonely person</UTT>hahah probably. I wonder if that position is remote so you would not need to go into the office.</UTT>that's the only way you or I would do it. Ha! Who won the world series? I don't remember.</UTT>I am not sure who won the most recent world series.</UTT>The women's world cup had higher ratings than the US world series???</UTT>Yes, I did hear that. I was a little surprised.</UTT>pretty bad if you're a cubs fan, last time your team won the world series, the ottoman empire was still in existence.</UTT>That was so long ago! I am going to go try to find out who won the last world series. It was nice talking to you.</UTT>1

Do you ever shop at Target?</UTT>I have shopped at Target. It seems like a nice store, nicer than Walmart, if you ask me.</UTT>I would agree. Did you know that they will price match Amazon?</UTT>I suppose these days they have to. Amazon is everywhere and any time! Target really needs to compete.</UTT>It's a good idea. Did you also know that there are no Target stores in Vermont?</UTT>I wonder what's special about Vermont. Is it the law or something? It's right next door to New Hampshire. Hm. Target doesn' carry tobacco, either.</UTT>That's a good question. I did not know that they didn't sell tobacco. I wonder how long that's been the case?</UTT>It's been at least 20 years, though I wonder what stopped sales. There is money in tobacco. Maybe they want to have a friendly, safe image.</UTT>I'm sure that's the reason. I had also heard that there is a state senator that has to also work at Target to make enough money.</UTT>I guess being a state senator really doesn't pay well. But why Target? Aren't there better jobs out there?</UTT>You would think so. Maybe the flexibility?</UTT>I guess. Seasonal work, flexible hours. Target stopped selling tobacco, but they sell herbal supplments. Talk about a bogus product.</UTT>Yeah I'm not a believer in holistic medicine myself. Off topic but do you watch a lot of TV. I watch a whole lot.</UTT>I sometimes watch the box when I'm in the gym. Try to catch up on the news and stuff.</UTT>Are you a fan of The Simpsons?</UTT>I enjoyed the first eight seasons. I don't find the recent stuff interesting. The show has run its course. You?</UTT>I haven't seen it in a long time but I used to watch it. Did you know that there is only one episode ever where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned?</UTT>The show really was about Bart and his hijinks. I think it's funny that That 70's Show was remade verbatim in the UK and flopped. Something about casting didn't work, I think.</UTT>Those things rarely do. The only one I can think of that really did was The Office. Did you happen to see the Family Guy episode of South Park?</UTT>I did. It was the one when the manatees were fetching balls to make up a story line. Good episode.</UTT>It was hilarious. After that episode aired, The Simpsons crew sent flowers to the South Park office which is find very funny.</UTT>1

Hi Do you know much about cars?</UTT>I know a little bit about them. I know that I love driving and would rather not have to walk if I can help it! Do you?</UTT>Hahaha  I'm like you.  I was surprised to learn that the first patent was issued in 1886 to Karl Benz.</UTT>Really? That is surprising to hear! In 2014 it was estimated that the number of cars was over 1.25 Billion! I wonder how many more there are now!</UTT>Holy smokes!  That's a lot of plastic and metal.  I wonder if Karl Benz ever wondered there would be that many cars when he was developing them.</UTT>Yeah! I bet he never imagined we'd have that many cars! It's a shocking number, for sure! Did you know it's legal in South Africa to have a flame thrower on your car?</UTT>I didn't know that.  Yikes!  What do they do with them?</UTT>Ha! I'm assuming use them for road rage situations. But they say, they use them to prevent carjackings.</UTT>That sounds scary to live there if they have to put those on their cars to prevent that.  The first car that was made available to the masses was the Model T built by Ford in 1908.  I've seen those in parades.</UTT>Model T Ford, just sounds cool! I'm sure I've likely seen one before. Jann Mardenborough became a pro race car driver by beating 90,000 people in the video game gran turismo! I used to love that game!</UTT>That is interesting.  I wonder if that was part of a contest or something?  I didn't realize McDonalds didn't have drive thrus until 1975.</UTT>Yeah! I heard they added the drive-thrus then so that soldiers in fatigues didn't have to get out of their cars, since they weren't allowed to.</UTT>Yes!  Do you know how the backs of cars became to be known as trunks?</UTT>Nope. I never thought about it. Do you?</UTT>They are called that because in the early days of cars people used to carry wooden trunks on the back of them.</UTT>That hardly sounds very safe for ones belongings! But hey, if that's all they could do back then, I get it! Do you have a dog?</UTT>I do have a dog!  Did you know that they are not color blind?</UTT>No I didn't! I always thought they were! So they see color?</UTT>They just can't see as many different colors as humans.  I have to get ready to wrap things up for the evening.  I enjoyed the chat!</UTT>Oh wow! Interesting! Yeah, I have to get going too. Have a great night! :)</UTT>You have a great night too!</UTT>1

hey there, do you watch drama?</UTT>I watch it occasionally, but I am a huge fantasy fan. I would like to watch with the kids Mary and the Witch's Flower.</UTT>Nice. did you know people fantasy draft the national spelling bee?</UTT>I could see that, sounds like you won't get much money for that though. Rather be a paid actor at that point.</UTT>true. did you know there is also fantasy congress?</UTT>That itself sounds very boring I'd rather shoot myself than to do that.</UTT>I guess there are people who enjoy it. Did you know there is a single fold in the brain that makes the difference about fantasy and reality?</UTT>yes, i've looked this up after watching the matrix. It's very interesting.</UTT>So amazing. have you ever watched The House?</UTT>No. I'd rather read the 15,145 page fantasy manuscript written by a janitor from chicago.</UTT>That is amazing how he did that</UTT>Well it took him 6 years to write it. I don't even know how if I could dedicate such time to do it.</UTT>Exactly. do you know michael cane?</UTT>I do not know a michael cane. I know a michael caine, a michael scott.</UTT>yeah, caine . He apparently became an actor because all the pretty girls were in drama class.</UTT>I do not understand.</UTT>DO you know Jon Hamm?</UTT>Not sure who that guy is. I know the famous people like Spielberg.</UTT>He is an actor and used to be a drama teacher. Do you know Ellie Kemper?</UTT>Yes, I love Ellie Kemper. She is beautiful.</UTT>She is really funny. Nice chat.</UTT>1

Do you own a car?</UTT>Yes, I  do.  It's hard to find public transportation in our area.</UTT>Same here, rural living at its finest! It isn't a cadillac is it?</UTT>No, it is not.  I heard that Cadillac was named after a French explorer who founded Detroit.</UTT>Yep that is right, his name was antonie de la mothe cadillac. I am glad they just stuck with Cadillac lol</UTT>I know, right?  His entire name is so hard to pronounce.</UTT>For sure, doesn't quite roll off the tongue very good. Did you know in south africa you can equip your car with flamethrowers?</UTT>Yes, I know.  It is illegal in the US.</UTT>For sure, and very dangerous I bet. I need a flame thrower to warm my car up in this cold weather</UTT>Where are you located?  East part of the US?  It's warm in Texas.  Do you know why McDonalds' added the first drive through?</UTT>Iowa, so cold here! Did they add it to make it easy to obtain food lazily? lol</UTT>You are funny.  It was in order to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their uniform.</UTT>that is some nice respect. That probably helped profits around military bases.</UTT>Most businesses think of themselves before thinking of their customers.  I'm sure McDonalds just wanted to be more profitable.</UTT>yea very good point, lol! Did you knw why they call it a trunk</UTT>Because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back.</UTT>there you go, pretty easy lol! I wonder how easy it was to steal from someones trunk in the early days</UTT>It should be really easy.   Did you hear about someone who became  a professional race car driver because he beat 90000 people in the video game Gran Turismo?</UTT>I used to love playing that game. I couldn't imagine playing anyone 90000 times, but it paid off in the end for that guy. What was his name?</UTT>Jann Mardenborough.  Have you heard this name before?</UTT>I have never heard that name. I am going to google him. It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>It was nice chatting with you too.</UTT>1

Did you know in south africa you can equip your car with flamethrowers?</UTT>Yep that is right, his name was antonie de la mothe cadillac. I am glad they just stuck with Cadillac lol</UTT>Jann Mardenborough.  Have you heard this name before?</UTT>Yes, I know.  It is illegal in the US.</UTT>Because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back.</UTT>Yes, I  do.  It's hard to find public transportation in our area.</UTT>It was nice chatting with you too.</UTT>Where are you located?  East part of the US?  It's warm in Texas.  Do you know why McDonalds' added the first drive through?</UTT>Do you own a car?</UTT>Iowa, so cold here! Did they add it to make it easy to obtain food lazily? lol</UTT>that is some nice respect. That probably helped profits around military bases.</UTT>You are funny.  It was in order to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their uniform.</UTT>No, it is not.  I heard that Cadillac was named after a French explorer who founded Detroit.</UTT>I have never heard that name. I am going to google him. It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>Same here, rural living at its finest! It isn't a cadillac is it?</UTT>there you go, pretty easy lol! I wonder how easy it was to steal from someones trunk in the early days</UTT>I know, right?  His entire name is so hard to pronounce.</UTT>most people think that way</UTT>It should be really easy.   Did you hear about someone who became  a professional race car driver because he beat 90000 people in the video game Gran Turismo?</UTT>For sure, and very dangerous I bet. I need a flame thrower to warm my car up in this cold weather</UTT>0
When I was a kid I used to always collect baseball cards. I heard a man found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. Have you ever collected baseball cards?</UTT>That's cool.  Sadly, bo I never collected baseball cards.  What about you?</UTT>I love baseball so yes, but none are worth any crazy money. Do you watch baseball at all?</UTT>Yes, I do watch some games.  I read somewhere that managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams, if the need arises.  How wild is that?</UTT>Yeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team?</UTT>My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves and they have been around as long as the Cubs, too.  Both were founded the same year as the Little Bighorn battle.  Wow!</UTT>Both those teams have so much fans. My dad said when the Cubs won in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. Have you heard of the cubs curse?</UTT>Yeah, it's pretty funny actually. It started in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in the stadium with his smelly pet goat.</UTT>The best part about baseball is watching the world series. I remember when the red sox came back and beat the Yankees down 0-3. Its crazy how its been going on since 1903. I wonder how many people actually watch it still.</UTT>I think it's still pretty popular.  You know in Japan is so popular, many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.</UTT>I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series.</UTT>Worldwide I think Soccer rules.  But, baseball is still pretty popular, too.  I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  That's kind of strange.</UTT>Speaking of strange I heard that the cubs have employed a pitcher with 6 fingers. I do not know why my dad likes that team</UTT>Yeah, they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers on their pitching hand. Uncommon, but totally true!</UTT>Another weird thing about the cubs is the last time they won the ottoman empire was still going. Do you really think they were cursed?</UTT>I don't know about cursed, probably just bad luck on their part.</UTT>They started out so good, they were the first team to win back to back. seems kinda weird maybe baseball is fixed.</UTT>I've said that before, myself!  Did you know the great Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 World Series with his team down by one run?</UTT>People do not care even if it is fixed, they still wanna watch it. in 2005 a couple scheduled 2430 games!</UTT>Yeah, I heard that they did that for 24 years.  They must be very organized to keep all those schedules straight.</UTT>Baseball is a fun sport, I like seeing it in person live. Have you ever seen baseball in person?</UTT>Yes, I have seen many baseball games in my lifetime.  I still love it just as much as I did when I was a kid, playing.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to get to work.  I'll talk to you later, friend.</UTT>1

Have you heard about the hs teacher in FL who had students help him drown raccoons in class?</UTT>Yes.  That must have been traumatic for the kids and against the law too.</UTT>Traumatic, I'm sure, for the student who shot a video broadcast on an Orlando TV station. The teacher was a long-time, 34 year veteran teacher in Ocala, FL.</UTT>I can understand that the raccoons were a problem.  They were killing chickens.  But he obviously had trapped them.  He should have taken them to the woods many miles away.</UTT>Exactly. That's what we'd do in my rural area of the northeast. Most people understand that raccoons can be pests.</UTT>Apparently the law would have allowed humane euthanasia, but I don't know that methods are considered humane.</UTT>It's certainly humane to relocate animals if possible. Can't you just imagine the range of comments this event brought out on Facebook?</UTT>I am sure it went viral.  You know the color scheme on Facebook is largely blue because its founder is red-green colorblind.</UTT>Shame Zuckerberg can't see green because he has a LOT of "green" most of us will never see.</UTT>True.  But we won't have to testify before Congress either. Facebook sure had humble beginnings with its start in a few colleges.</UTT>Absolutely. Launched in 2004. Over 1 million registered users by, I believe, 2006 or 2007. Public offering in 2012. That's fast growth.</UTT>I love it that Americans continue to create such value like that and Google and Amazon.  Last year Facebook had 2.2 billion users who are active.</UTT>I didn't know that. I'm beginning to become wary of these new "giants" of the information age. Facebook has surged eons ahead of the book of faces in collegiate directories, hasn't it?</UTT>Yes.  Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million.  Blockbuster also turned down an offer to buy Netflix for $50 million.  Both of the potential buyers are now gone or nearly gone.</UTT>I'll be somebody out there is rueful today about their decision in 2005 (MySpace) not to purchase Facebook.</UTT>Undoubtedly.  I wish I could relive 2008 over and get my money out of the stock market before it crashed.  I read that the "like" button is illegal in one German state.</UTT>Sorry about your financial loss. Impossible to "like" in any way. Maybe the German restrictions make some sense.</UTT>I just said it to demonstrate that there are many people with financial regrets. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?</UTT>Funky. The only fish I know well are trout, bass and catfish, all considered olfactores, I believe. (No limbs with digits).</UTT>Those are all fresh water fish, which means that they "drink" water through their skins rather than their mouths.</UTT>Yes. I've never done ocean fishing, but I'd love to catch a small shark and prepare a meal with it right on deck. Saltwater fish like sharks drink, too, through gills and their mouths. Wanna put a tasty shark in my mouth. I've been told they're delicious.</UTT>My problem with deep sea fishing is I like to be in control.  When I want to go to shore, I want to go now.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is supposed to be immortal.  I guess whoever said that does not know the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy is increasing.  That means that all particles in the universe will someday be moving in a random way.  No jellyfish then.</UTT>As far as I can see, a lot of things in my universe are moving randomly already. In the election of 2020, I hope that course can be corrected! Good to speak with you. Thanks.</UTT>Likewise.  Bye.</UTT>1

hi!</UTT>Hi, can you imagine the US not charging income tax like Monaco!</UTT>no that's crazy! Did you know 86% of Nevada is owned by the government, crazy!</UTT>No, i didnt! Why do they own so much?</UTT>I think it's a power trip, not sure! You know the government does what it wants lol</UTT>I would agree with you! Do you think the US is a strict as China? They censor the word "censorship".</UTT>Oh wow, I do not think the US is as strict as China</UTT>My brother was in China teaching English and even the internet is locked down there. I kinda this its odd that we publish peoples name who renounce their citizenship.</UTT>I agree! China is very strict from everything I have read. Was your brother happy in China? I think the government goes too far most of the time in some countries.</UTT>He enjoyed China! He missed a lot of the thing back here in the US though. Are you a Hanson fan?</UTT>I bet he missed a lot! I am not sure are you talking about Hanson the singers? I hear them on the radio once in awhile.</UTT>Yes, exactly! They are actually from a town near where i lived in Oklahoma. Can you believe that they had a song that was the most requested on a Alt/Rock station?</UTT>Wow, I was not aware of that. They were pretty popular for awhile! Did you know in Canada all radios must play 40% canadian music??? Wow.</UTT>Haha, i didnt know that. Come to think of it i dont really even know that many Canadian bands.</UTT>I don't either! lol, some of the Governments want to rule everything i think. There was a man who acted as a government official and sold the eiffel tower! 2 times!</UTT>Maybe the government isn't doing to well if they've had to be bailed out by JP Morgan.</UTT>Right?? Our world is so mixed up, hopefully one day our Government and politicians will make sense for a change.</UTT>Are you affected by the government shut-down? I cant believe they've shut down 17 times.</UTT>I am not thankfully! But I know many who are and I think the Government needs to be the ones to not get paid until they sort everything out!</UTT>I did hear that many are still collecting salaries while not working. Thats not good.</UTT>They are? I think I heard that but it will be delayed in getting paid. Only the people actually working should still be paid as usual it's not right how the system works.</UTT>have a great day!</UTT>1

I don't like Kin Jong Un or his sister</UTT>I don't know much about them.</UTT>Yes when we have a reality TV star as president many people look for cult of celebrity in politics</UTT>I heard that he had his own defense minister killed.</UTT>Yes he has killed many people.  He tortured witnesses and his own family members</UTT>I've heard that about him. I don't even think they have the internet in North Korea.</UTT>The regular people do not but the king does.  He has a lot of things while his people are starving</UTT>Apparently Kim Jong Un cuts his own hair too.</UTT>He is unlike most celebrities with money and fame for sure.</UTT>He also apparently orders the repairs of theme parks himself.</UTT>I did not know anything about North Korea having theme parks.  Many celebrities in the US make lots of money - even minor ones like Judge Judy.</UTT>I believe that she makes a lot of money, she is on TV every single day. It is hilarious.</UTT>Yes.  I love that Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who believes he can combat hunger by encouraging diverse eating</UTT>That is very interesting, I've never heard of Jenna Marble the youtube celebrity, but apparently she makes $346,827 from it.</UTT>Wow.  I knew youtube can pay some people a lot for ads!</UTT>They do, you have to wonder how long something like that will be able to last though.</UTT>But some are even teenagers making much more than working at McDonalds!</UTT>This is true, I wonder if people in North Korea could earn a living off of Youtube.</UTT>I don't think the people in North Korea have access to the Internet</UTT>I do not think they do either, apparently not good barbers either!</UTT>Yes North Korea is an awful dictatorship run by the Kim family for years.</UTT>1

Hello! Do you like watching movies?</UTT>yes, i love watching movies. you?</UTT>I do too! What is your favorite genre?</UTT>i like all genres but usually drama, thriller and comedy are my faves.</UTT>Oh cool! I wish I took Jon Hamm's drama class in high school, I'd be somewhere today!</UTT>i wish i had taken drama from a famous teacher too. i might have ended up on the tv or something. doing a movie with TC</UTT>I would have rather worked with Hugh Laurie! He made bank!</UTT>yes, i bet he got paid more than the rest of the cast combined. but he got more talent than the rest of the cast combined.</UTT>He still isn't worth as much as Tom Cruise though! Or even Seinfeld!</UTT>nobody is worth seinfeld. the man is so rich he should start his own country. what does he do all day anyway? count his money?</UTT>He really is! I bet it's a full time job! Did you know TC built an underground bunker?</UTT>yeah, that sounds like scientology. i figure he is anticipating the alien invasion. can he speak alien? does he know the UN ambassador?</UTT>He's crazy! He even threatened a guy with the name Tom Kruse!</UTT>yes, he is very protective of his identity. i guess he thought that he had to defend his name. he is a street guy that way.</UTT>I guess he is! Full of drama though haha. Jim Carrey isn't though and avoids making dramas!</UTT>i think that he is wrong on that score. drama can be uplifting and positive. i reckon he could do quite well dramatically.</UTT>I think so too, besides the number 23. Have you ever listened to any radio dramas?</UTT>i did when i was younger. they can be quite exciting and dramatic. i can see why the kids loved them.</UTT>I will have to listen to them since I can find them free online!</UTT>You should! Lemont Cranston as The Shadow! Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Great chat to you as well. Have a good night!</UTT>1

Hello - how are you doing today?</UTT>Hello. I am doing good and yourself?  Do you have an iphone by chance?</UTT>I'm doing good too. I do have an iPhone. What about you?</UTT>i don't, i have an android but i've heard that iphones have more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent.</UTT>I've heard that too which is kind of scary stuff.</UTT>It really is.  Phones are wonderful inventions though.  Just think about it. They convert sound into electrical signals.</UTT>I can't imagine not having a phone. New York's area code is 212 because this was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.</UTT>Is that right?  I wonder what the rest of the country thought about that when area codes were decided.</UTT>Not too sure. The cables carrying phone and data lines across the ocean are only 2.7 inches thick and just lay on the ocean floor.</UTT>That's incredible that all of that information travels in lines so small!</UTT>I agree! It's impossible to separate two phonebooks that have their pages overlapped together.</UTT>You know, I've actually heard that before. I guess it would have to be too very thick phone books for that to be.</UTT>I saw that Unicef will donate a day of clean water to child in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone.</UTT>That's a great program! I'd like to find out more about it. Do you know how to sign up or anything like that?</UTT>I do not. Do you like the movie Jumanji?</UTT>i like the original with Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt.  It was good!</UTT>I do too! The boy from Jumanji was the voice of chip in Beauty and the Beast.</UTT>I didn't know that.  That's cool.  Oh, hey, I do know that Bradley Pierce did the original voice of miles on sonic the hedgehog.</UTT>I didn't know that. Jumanji had an opening weekend in the US of $36 million.</UTT>That's pretty good for something that started out as a children's book in 1981!</UTT>I think so too. Tim Curry is the voice of slick in the Jumanji cartoon.</UTT>I like him.  The movie is taken from a book by Chris Van Allsburg and he also wrote the movie so I bet that's why it's so good.</UTT>1

I guess it would have to be too very thick phone books for that to be.</UTT>I think so too. Tim Curry is the voice of slick in the Jumanji cartoon.</UTT>That's a great program! I'd like to find out more about it. Do you know how to sign up or anything like that?</UTT>I saw that Unicef will donate a day of clean water to child in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone.</UTT>i like the original with Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt.  It was good!</UTT>Hello - how are you doing today?</UTT>I didn't know that.  That's cool.  Oh, hey, I do know that Bradley Pierce did the original voice of miles on sonic the hedgehog.</UTT>I do not. Do you like the movie Jumanji?</UTT>That's pretty good for something that started out as a children's book in 1981!</UTT>I do too! The boy from Jumanji was the voice of chip in Beauty and the Beast.</UTT>I like him.  The movie is taken from a book by Chris Van Allsburg and he also wrote the movie so I bet that's why it's so good.</UTT>0
Hello, are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>I am indeed! My favorite politician is Hillary Clinton.</UTT>I like her too! She definitely was raised to be a politician, she was even president of Young Republicans in college.</UTT>I find that interesting, but unsurprising. She's so accomplished. I guess she even has a grammy for the spoken word album of her book.</UTT>Yeah I would've never thought of her being famous that way! I saw a White House lecture online with Stephen Hawking that also had the Clintons featured.</UTT>How interesting. That's how you know you've made it...when you're associated with Stephen Hawking! I was so very excited to find out that she was the Democratic Party's nominee for President in 2016.</UTT>Oh yeah, she definitely was raised to be excellent with campaigns. Although I always thought it was strange the way she pandered to her audience, like when campaigning in the South she'd put on a Southern accent.</UTT>I think she's smart...there's probably a reason why she did that. I definitely think she could have handled the job of the President.</UTT>I think she could have too. The only thing I hold against her is she can be awkward with foreign relations and things get lost in translation. Like her and Sergey Lavrov pressed a "reset" button but it was incorrectly translated to be "overload" haha.</UTT>I understand your point. Being the president is such an important role. I wish we could have added her to the list of U.S. presidents.</UTT>And I think she'd be good at business too! I wonder how much she's worth, maybe she coud be one of the wealthiest presidents of all time.</UTT>Actually, the top three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. I wonder how she'd stack up.</UTT>Wow that's surprising! You would have thought Trump would be there somewhere. The U.S. presidential guest house is bigger than the White House.</UTT>You know, if this were 1805, Clinton would be the vice president! I guess in before the 19th century, the runner up of the election would become the vice president.</UTT>It's definitely a good thing that's changed since then! Now we seem to be more professional with the system. At least compared to other countries, like in Indonesia the president has released 3 albums while in office.</UTT>Hmm, I wonder if his songs were ever on the radio!</UTT>I'm not sure! I bet if they were we could have tuned in, am radios are able to pick up anything, even radio storms from Jupiter!</UTT>Radio is definitely such an underrated form of media. It's so simple, but so very effective. It's so simple that some soldiers in WWII made radios using razorblades and pencils.</UTT>That's incredible</UTT>I would agree wholeheartedly. There's also a website where you can listen to radio dramas for free, if you're interested.</UTT>That really does sound interesting! I have a preference for learning over the radio. I like one station a lot, it broadcasts a weekly news program entirely in classical latin!</UTT>I love classical latin! I bet Canada doesn't though...I guess in Canada, 40% of the content played on the radio needs to be Canadian. I bet they're not listening to latin!</UTT>Oh yeah that's a strange law, you'd think radio would be more free huh! Well it was nice talking to you, have a nice night!</UTT>1

Hey there what do you think about the president? And who do you think the top three most wealthy presidents were?</UTT>I think the President is probably in the top 3 richest presidents along with Kennedy and maybe Bush. Am I right?</UTT>Well it's actually JFK, Washington, and also Jefferson. I wouldn't have predicted that, but I guess it makes sense if your accounting for inflation, have you heard about the president of Zimbabwe yet?</UTT>I do not know about the President of Zimbabwe. I do know in Guatemala close relative of former Presidents cannot run for President</UTT>Well the president of Zimbabwe, his name is actually president banana haha. I wonder if he has a vice president named plantain LOL, and also the president of Indonesia released three pop albums, I kind of want to listen to those haha</UTT>Wow! Presidents around the world are very interesting! Did you know that only one of our Presidents had a PhD, Woodrow Wilson.</UTT>No I didn't know that! We should have more presidents with phds, did you know that before 1905, the runner-up would become the vice president, so you would have had President Trump and Vice President Clinton today?</UTT>I did know that! It must have been hard to work with your opponent, perhaps even harder than losing the election while having the popular vote. That happened to 5 candidates for president.</UTT>Yeah that would be hard. I wonder if that would be more or less hard and making three pop albums while in office like the president of Indonesia did?</UTT>Seems difficult to me. Also hard is learning another language, that last president to speak a foreign language was FDR.</UTT>That is interesting. Also I think it's weird that Nevada has a"none of these candidates"option when they vote, I think that could be used in other states as well, it would be useful</UTT>Wow, I wonder if we would ever have a President then or an inauguration. Lincoln was the first president to be photographer for his inauguration....with John Wilkes Booth in the photo!</UTT>Well that's very scary! Definitely a bad Omen, did you know that our top voter participation percentage has maxed out at about 63%, that seems really low to me, and that's over the last 100 years</UTT>I'd believe it, especially that a cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia Senate election. I'm not sure people take voting seriously.</UTT>No I don't think so. Especially since the taller candidate wins about 75% of the time, that's highly unlikely to be due to ideas, and instead is probably a factor of television showing the height difference</UTT>Well, he may not be tall but a dog beat two people for mayor. He served for 13 years.</UTT>Haha that's funny. I wonder what his daily routine consisted of? Speaking of Elections, did you hear that ancient Athens used to just use a lottery system? I could see how that would elect a dog LOL</UTT>In Oregon all elections are conducted by mail. I am so surprised at how different elections can be across the world!</UTT>That is interesting! do you go to any concerts by the way? They should have presidential election concerts haha</UTT>That would be great. Thanks for chatting. I learned a lot of cool new things!</UTT>I did too, and I'm going to make sure to avoid a free concert lol they were sued for having really bad concerts actually</UTT>1

Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?</UTT>No but I figure since he was so good in martial arts moves, dancing would come easy.  What is more surprising is Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.</UTT>Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.</UTT>Well another actress who won dancing was Emilia Clarke.  She did the funky chicken dance and robot dance during her audition to Game of Thrones.</UTT>It doesn't seem that that would help her get the part.  Tupac danced ballet in high school.</UTT>Really!  I always thought he was softy in the inside.  Speaking of ballet, there are slippers that made drawings from the dancer's movements.</UTT>That would look like modern art to me.  Tupac obtained the role of Mouse King in a production of Nutcracker, so he was serious about it.</UTT>Another dance who took his job seriously was tap dancer Bill Bailey he was the first to do the moon walk ever recorded.  This whole time I thought Michael Jackson was the first.</UTT>I did not know that.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, so I must have lost my sense of rhythm between 1 and 5 years old.</UTT>Well Richard Nixon had a great sense of rhythm, he wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show.</UTT>That is incredible!  Ballet dancers can wear out 4 pairs of dancing shoes per week.  Looks like that could find a more durable material.</UTT>Dance is such a beautiful art even parrots are getting into the action.  Parrots are able to dance perfectly in time with music.</UTT>My daughter used to have an African Grey.  I have seen the bird do it.  My wife plays the piano which is a stringed instrument but because of the hammers can be a percussion instrument setting the beat for the parrot.</UTT>Do you think parrots can dance to the sound of a piano?  It crazy to think that steam piano's used to exist and I hear they are very loud.</UTT>They can move with the beat. There is a gorgeous pianist named Lola Anastanove or something like that that I saw on Youtube.  Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody as Paul McCartney used for Hey Jude.</UTT>Interesting fact!  I saw a Youtube video about a mute man who was found wandering the streets in England and the only way he could communicate was via piano.</UTT>In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano.</UTT>How in the world could a piano have been placed there?  Fun piano fact.  Mozart and Haydn two of the biggest composers of the classical era each owned a piano made from the same tree.</UTT>That is a fun fact.  I would guess a helicopter on the piano placement.  They needed a light grand piano on the Hindenburg, so they made one of aluminum and it weighed 356 pounds.</UTT>All these fun piano facts and to think Italy was the county that invented the piano.</UTT>We have a 7 ft 6 inch grand in our house.  It is a great instrument.  Don't forget to look up Lola, the greatest female pianist of the day.. Nice talking with you.</UTT>1

Do you like watching youtube?</UTT>Yes, I watched, YouTube this morning. I  even subscribed to new videos.</UTT>nice, it is awesome! It is the second most visited search engine</UTT>It is popular, it's been around since 2005.</UTT>that is a long time. I think Google owns it now. Good investment, they have #1 and #2 popular search engines</UTT>Wow, that's incredible. I like Facebook as well,  it started a year before YouTube in 2004.</UTT>wow, how time as flown! I like facebook most of the time. Can you believe myspace turned down buying it?</UTT>They must be kicking themselves. That's a 104 billion dollar company!</UTT>Right and it would have only costed 50 million. They should have bought it anyways since it was the competition!</UTT>True, I have been on  Facebook so long I remember when it was expanded to people in higher education institutions.</UTT>I started in like 2006 I think, it was so cool to start. I didn't like the blue look though</UTT>Oh, that's only because the founder  suffers from red-green color blindness.</UTT>well that makes sense lol. I wonder why no other colors were put into it though. Oh well, what am i to say, it is worth the 104 billion</UTT>They get money from advertisers. Once, Burger King had a promotion to unfriend people for a whopper. LOL.</UTT>I loved that promotion, did you take part of that?</UTT>No, but if I was hungry enough I would have. LOL.  I do use the like button on Facebook, but did you know it's illegal in a German state?</UTT>Me too, I should've did it, I have 100s of friends I could have deleted lol. I wonder why it is illegal, thoughts?</UTT>I am unsure.  I know in Iceland they use it for suggestions about their constitution.</UTT>That is awesome, power to the people! I am sure they hear crazy ideas though lol. It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>It was great chatting with you as well.</UTT>Enjoy your day, unadd some friends for that whopper!</UTT>1

have you been to Hall in Springfield Mass?</UTT>No, I have not, you?</UTT>Yeah I have been to Springfield, FASCINATING.</UTT>wow, what was an experience.  Btw, do you watch basketball</UTT>I am not such a big fan, but at least I know what NBA Stands for.</UTT>I am its fan.  Do you know Reggie Miller</UTT>No What Team Does he play for? Golden state?</UTT>For Indiana.  His sister is Cheryl and she is a basketball player</UTT>Ohh I see, its common for pro players to have family play like seth curry and mychel thompson brothers of steph curry played in the back court together</UTT>Exactly.  btw, did you know that Allen Iverson had a lifetime contract with Reebook, and he will get 32 million dollars by the time he turn 55 years old</UTT>omg they get paid too much, can he get paid in a lump sum?</UTT>That is a lump sum.  Such a lucky guy.</UTT>wow that's definitely lucky, but hey, i couldn't shoot a ball the way they do in that 9.4 inches diameter court so I guess they deserve it because they got talent.</UTT>they are the best in the world.  So they deserve the money.  Also, do you know Kareem abdul-jabbar</UTT>Well its mastery and training, well you know whats strange, the guy who invented busketball By the name James, is the only losing coach in the university of Kansas's History, its crazy lol. Not Particular, who is Abdul?</UTT>I really do not know how such a coach had a losing record.  Abdul is a very famous basketball player who used to play for Lakers, and he is very tall</UTT>OMG all players are tall, I think its a requirement for them to be good at the game.</UTT>Yeah, that is the nature of the game.  Some of them are not that tall, but these are exceptions.  Also, do you know Tim Duncan</UTT>ohh Yeah that's Fascinating, Yeah I know Tim Duncan of San Antonio spurs</UTT>He is my favorite player because of his talent on the course and his personality off the course.</UTT>Yeah He seems to have discipline, I read it somewhere that he stayed in college for 4 years instead of going directly to NBA.</UTT>Exactly.  Btw, nice chatting with you.  Have a happy holiday</UTT>YOU TOO HAPPY HOLIDAYS</UTT>bye</UTT>1

Do you know anything about astronomy and the planets?</UTT>Hello - I know a little bit. What about you?</UTT>Not too much, but have been wanting to learn about the earth.</UTT>Did you know that more than 80% of Earth's natural forests have been destroyed?</UTT>That is terrible!     Do you know how old the earth is?</UTT>I do not. How old is it?</UTT>I believe it is 4.5 billion years old.    Did you know in the early era of the planet, a day was much shorter!</UTT>That's a long long time! I did not know that either about shorter days. I saw that in 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials.</UTT>I wonder if extraterrestrials listen to radio storms from Jupiter?</UTT>I bet they do if they exist. Hard to believe you can hear them on Earth.</UTT>Maybe not Canada though, where all radios must play 40% Canadian music.</UTT>That is an odd law. Soldiers in WWII made radios using razorblades and pencils as the diode.</UTT>I wonder if one could build a guitar with crude tools like that.</UTT>I bet someone could come up with a way to do that.</UTT>It might not be able to set speakers on fire like Eddie Van Halen once did.</UTT>HAHA that's awesome! Pink Floyd's guitarist turned a houseboat on the river into a floating recording studio.</UTT>I wonder if smashing a guitar like Matthew Bellamy would sink such a location!</UTT>LOL. Brian May uses coins as a pick.</UTT>He is also a smart guy with a phd in astrophysics.</UTT>Wow - that's pretty amazing. I would have never guessed that.</UTT>I guess it might help.    Certainly more than classical latin, which is only useful if listening to a Finnish weekly news show!</UTT>1

I saw that in 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials.</UTT>I guess it might help.    Certainly more than classical latin, which is only useful if listening to a Finnish weekly news show!</UTT>Did you know that more than 80% of Earth's natural forests have been destroyed?</UTT>Not too much, but have been wanting to learn about the earth.</UTT>That is an odd law. Soldiers in WWII made radios using razorblades and pencils as the diode.</UTT>I wonder if smashing a guitar like Matthew Bellamy would sink such a location!</UTT>I wonder if extraterrestrials listen to radio storms from Jupiter?</UTT>Do you know anything about astronomy and the planets?</UTT>I wonder if one could build a guitar with crude tools like that.</UTT>He is also a smart guy with a phd in astrophysics.</UTT>0
Hello, How are you tonight? Have you seen the Tesla car?</UTT>Yes I've actually driven in a Tesla before, what about you? I like that they have a lot of vehicles coming out like the model S and model X these days</UTT>Yeah, I heard they were coming out with new cars. Exciting!! What do you think of Elon Musk? I have watched him a few times in interviews.</UTT>Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL</UTT>Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014.</UTT>Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha</UTT>Most people wouldn't, wonder why? To help the environment? Who knows he probably got something else better lined up!</UTT>Yeah I agree. It's crazy though that they named themselves after Nikola Tesla, but they're not the only company that was named after him! There is another car company called just Nicola apparently</UTT>Interesting, I owned an electric car for 3 years, it was an easy car to drive. My husband named it the phantom! He could never here when I got home. lol</UTT>Haha well that is one benefit of the electric-car then! On a different note though, what do you think about Fox News? Apparently they broadcasting over 86 countries around the world</UTT>About the only one I watch these days! I didn't know Richard Nixon was one of the creators!</UTT>Yeah I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that they were going to sue The Simpsons because they kept parodying them, I thought that fox owns The Simpsons?</UTT>I did too! Didn't know they were going to create a cable channel  just for The Simpsons! Do you watch that show?</UTT>I liked to watch The Simpsons yes, back to fox news though it's interesting that their median viewer age is 68, that seems old</UTT>Yes, That's strange, find that hard to believe. I do believe Fox news is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.</UTT>Yes I think you're right. It's also interesting that Fox News has only 55% of its time dedicated to opinion pieces while on MSNBC at 85% of the time, they definitely have a better percentage on Fox News in my opinion</UTT>I think so.Do you like Dance? I love to watch babies dance to music, adorable!!</UTT>Yes I agree with you! I also think it's funny that the girl from Game of Thrones did the robot dance and also the Funky Chicken during her audition LOL I wish I could see that tape</UTT>Ha, ha, ha,I can imagine that! I'm not surprised MJ used a device for the lean dance move? Wasn't that in the song  Smooth Criminal?</UTT>Yes I think so. I'm also shocked that he has a patent on that device. It's crazy though that the moonwalk was first performed in1955 so it's actually an old dance move</UTT>Really, didn't know that? 1955, they had all kind of different moves then. Good chat!!</UTT>Thank you you too! And watch out next time you see a ballet dancer, apparently some ballet slippers can make drawings out of the performers movements on the floor</UTT>1
Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014.</UTT>i do not either with the wife and kids</UTT>Really, didn't know that? 1955, they had all kind of different moves then.

Hey have you ever gotten a hot chocolate at 7:11?</UTT>Not that I can remember.  I guess some lade in VA used it when approached by two carjackers.</UTT>Yeah she was 50 years old and use the piping hot liquid to fend them off LOL that's actually a good idea</UTT>The police report only noted that her 22-year-old daughter did it but the article isn't clear.  Still, I guess it worked.</UTT>Yep instead of guns people should carry around hot chocolate LOL but I guess the temperature of the hot chocolate was 170 degrees which is insane</UTT>Yeah, you don't hear of people dying with hot chocolate although it is 171 degrees.</UTT>Yep and 158 degree water will cause third-degree Burns, so they definitely got burns on the thieves</UTT>They had it comin'.  There's a guy in AL that used hot coffee for 2 robberies. It didn't say if he got caught.</UTT>Speaking of robberies, have you ever gotten to a car before? I guess the lady what's about to get into hers before she was accosted</UTT>Nope. Speaking of cars, in S. Africa it's legal to equip one's car with a flame-thrower to prevent such things.</UTT>Wow that's cool! Do that someone beat 90,000 people at the game Gran Turismo and then later became a professional race car driver, like how is that possible</UTT>Don't know... I do know that I'm happy McDonald's added drive thrus to help soldiers and it has help me as well.</UTT>Haha yes it is definitely helped me to be lazy, they didn't want the soldiers to have to get out of their cars in their uniform</UTT>Yeah.  It's sad the Pilgrims got a bum rap for boring clothes.  They were actually full of color.  They only wore black for special occasions.  I see Grateful Dead tie-dyed for them...</UTT>Haha that is sad, I wonder what the Apple clothing from the 80's looked like they actually had their own clothing line back then</UTT>I don't remember that.  They do still sell t-shirts.</UTT>I'll have to look those up, would you buy a t-shirt that was made in North Korea though? That's where Rip Curl shirts are made even though on the tag they say China</UTT>No, I'm not a fan of their crazy leader.  Did ya know that some ballet dancers go thru 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week?  Their poor feet...</UTT>Yeah that sounds like it would hurt. What do you think about putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes? Have you ever tried it apparently it makes the shoes smell better</UTT>Maybe the should try some shoes that are 5,000 years old.  They found some that perform better than modern shoes.</UTT>Yeah I want to see what those shoes look like. Do you know who Stephon Marbury is? apparently he is promoting some $15 shoes but is not being paid to do so</UTT>1

Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !</UTT>Hi! Me too!</UTT>Hey do You know what Myspace is ? Did You ever had an account with them ? :)</UTT>I did have a MySpace acount! Kinda loved it! But then Facebook took over lol</UTT>Did You know Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in early 2005 ?</UTT>Wow, I guess that was a huge loss! Facebook is so big now! Did you know Face book is mostly blue because Zuckerburg has some color blindness?</UTT>I knew he was color bling, but I didn't know that was the reason Facebook is blue :)</UTT>I thought that was pretty interesting! Burger King once had a promotion that if you unfriended 10 people....you would get a free whopper lol...crazy!</UTT>Did You ever unfriended anybody ? :)</UTT>no way lol, all of my Facebook friends are well known to me.</UTT>I did unfriend some - not a lot :) I wonder if they know that  they are "unfriended" ;)</UTT>I guess they might know if they see your posts or not.</UTT>Maybe they just think I'm not posting anything ;)</UTT>true! So do you like any Tv shows?</UTT>Plenty :) Now I'm watching Ray Donovan :) You ?</UTT>I like That 70's Show sometimes and love Grey's Anatomy.</UTT>I missed both :) are they good ?</UTT>Yes, very good. I like comedy and Drama. They cancelled That 70s Show in the UK lol guess they didn't get the humor.</UTT>...but was it the same show, or a remake with different crew ?</UTT>No That 70S show is just reruns but Grays Anatomy is an ongoing series.</UTT>But in UK - was it our version of that show, or did they make their own version ?</UTT>Ohhh, that I don't know, good question! I watch Southpark sometimes it's a funny cartoon.</UTT>I love the satire to current events in South Park :) same in Family Guy and Simpsons :)</UTT>Yes! Me too. So are you a fan of the newest phones at all?</UTT>Not really :) I like my 2 year old Android phone :)</UTT>I like my older Android as well. The prices are too high for me. It has been great chatting!!! Have a great night!! :)</UTT>1

Do you remember about the confidential informant in the Trump campaign?</UTT>I had a vague recollection of that.  It was an FBI spy, right?</UTT>It was not an FBI spy - just someone in the campaign who was concerned about the connections between the Trump campaign and Russia.</UTT>oh ok, it was a confidential informant.  Trump claimed it was an FBI spy, but it wasn't.</UTT>Correct.  Even Lindsey Graham agreed  that he was not a spy.</UTT>Right, it seems the GOP did not want to back Trump on that whole spygate thing.</UTT>Yes it might have been the last time they stood up to Trump.  The president is a title for the head of state in most republics, but it is not a dictatorship</UTT>Right, although 5 have been elected while still losing the popular vote</UTT>Yes - the Republicans have lost the popular vote in 6 of the last 7 elections as their traditional demographic is shrinking.</UTT>That's true, they also don't seem very interested in reaching out beyond their traditional demographics.  I wonder how they plan to survive in the future?</UTT>I am not sure.  Their core support in recent years comes from the South and the Mountain states, and the Evangelicals.  The urban areas are all blue.</UTT>Hillary Clinton was a republican in college, apparently...that's interesting.</UTT>I did not know that.  Though she might be like me and grow more liberal as she ages.  Plus the Republican party has grown far more right-wing even since Reagan.</UTT>Yeah, the GOP is hard to relate to at times.  I try to be objective but its hard to even consider voting for a party that denies climate change and has people like Mike Pence that believe in conversion therapy.</UTT>I completely agree.  After the Civil Rights act and the Voting Rights Act they started shifting right and very conservative.  Taking away voting rights seems to be their big thing right now.</UTT>Yeah, they are not the party of Lincoln like they claim.  Although, Richard Nixon did propose a guaranteed minimum income.</UTT>Yes for sure.  I find it funny that Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride because he did not want to be associated with the Republicans!</UTT>That is really funny!  Lincoln was the first president to be photographed and john wilkes booth was in the photo...wow!</UTT>Wow that is crazy!   It fits though - every US president who has had a beard was a Republican!</UTT>Wow!  Trump should grow a beard.</UTT>I am not sure about an orange beard!  He might look like the first president of zimbabwe who was called president banana!</UTT>1

Did you find the first part of this kinda hard to read?  I thought it was somewhat emotionally upsetting.</UTT>I concur.  Shooting at innocent children is the worst crime ever</UTT>Yeah I can't imagine what it would be like to be in that situation.</UTT>I turned off my TV set when I saw these incidents because I could bear to watch them</UTT>Yeah that's kinda how I am with the news on TV it always seems to be negative stuff like what's mentioned in this article.</UTT>By any chance, you watch a lot of TV</UTT>Yeah mostly Netflix not much public channels, do you watch TV much?</UTT>I used to but not now because I am quite busy.  By any chance do you know the 70's show was remade verbatim in the UK</UTT>No I did not know that did you know that star wars is the most successful film merchandising franchise</UTT>I knew they was a big success but not this success</UTT>yeah absolutely, have you ever played xbox?</UTT>Yes, I play it a lot in my free time, you?</UTT>yes absolutely what game do you like to play</UTT>football fantasy, auto thef and the likes.  YOu?</UTT>fortnite, overwatch and halo</UTT>Ohh, they are good games</UTT>yeah i like them a lot did you know the army use xbox 360 controllers to fly uav spy planes</UTT>Do you know that there are controllers created for quadrilpegics so that they are able to play xbox 360 and other consoles</UTT>no i did not that is pretty fascinating</UTT>did you know that the army use xbox 360 controller to fly uav spy plane</UTT>yes i did know that</UTT>1

Hey, ever use Facebook?</UTT>I do, it is the primary source of news for 30% of American adults. Do you use facebook your self?</UTT>COnstantly, unfortunately. I'd consider Burger King's offer to get a free WHopper by unfriending 10 people if I liked Burger King.</UTT>Yeah that would be cool, everyone uses facebook now, there are more people on Facebook than there were people in the world 200 years ago.</UTT>They've come a long way since 2004.</UTT>they did, it's because since 2006, anyone who claimed they are at least 13 years old could register.</UTT>I had heard that Iceland was rewriting their constitution using input from people on Facebook. I suppose that's a 21st century of doing it.</UTT>Probably, the sad thing is a third of all divorce filling of 2011 in the United States contained the word Facebook, so I could just imagine facebook ruining people's lives and children.</UTT>That is sad. Remember when all our immediate communication was over the telephone? I remember being excited as a kid to pick it up and see who was calling.</UTT>I do too, life was so simple in the 90's, I was so excited too when someone called, did you know that there is a luxury phone maker that hires the London symphony orchestra to record ringtones</UTT>Wow, that seems unnecessary. I wonder if they've done the Benny Hill theme song?</UTT>I'm not sure but that would be so funny</UTT>I heard once that if you interleave all the pages of two phonebooks that you can't pull them apart. I think Mythbusters confirmed it.</UTT>Wow that's crazy, did you know that dolphins will communicate with each other using a telephone, and they even recognize each other over the phone</UTT>That's awesome. I often wonder if they really are smarter than us.</UTT>I'm not sure, I think humans are the smartest creature.talking about intelligence, the inventor of dial telephone was convinced that telephone operators were rerouting his calls to rival businesses.</UTT>Sounds paranoid to me.</UTT>Yeah he must be, did you know that President Andrew Johnson never attended school in his life.</UTT>That explains his presidency. Speaking of historical people CS Lewis and Tolkien used to have a bad poetry contest.</UTT>really that sounds interesting</UTT>You laugh, you lose, was the criteria.</UTT>it's been nice talking to you.</UTT>likewise</UTT>bye</UTT>1

Hi there!  Do you like cars?  I do because I would never get to go anywhere without one.</UTT>It is very useful for getting me around.  I dont know what I would do without it.</UTT>lol  Did you hear about the flame throwing cars they have in South Africa?</UTT>Yeah, carjacking must be pretty bad there.</UTT>No doubt!  Did you know when and why McDonalds added drive thrus?</UTT>I heard it was because of the soldiers.</UTT>Yes.  They added them in 1975.  Did you know that the backs of cars became known as trunks because cars used to carry wooden trunks on them back in the old days?</UTT>That makes a lot of sense.  I heard in England it is called the boot.</UTT>That's interesting!  Do you know who the car brand Cadillac was named after?</UTT>Its a french explorer.  Antoine de la mothe Cadillac</UTT>You get a super chat high five!  I was surprised to see that the first patent for a car was given out in 1886.</UTT>Yeah, me too,  I always thought it was Ford who did all that, but he was the first to mass produce.</UTT>Ford made the Model T in 1908 I believe?</UTT>Yes!  That is correct!</UTT>Do you like reading?</UTT>I do.  I dont understand the moral panic of the 18th century though.</UTT>Me neither.  Reading was one of the few forms of entertainment people had back then.  Enders Game is suggested reading for many military organizations including the Marines!</UTT>Its a good book!  Have you read it?  I am not sure int is military reading material though,</UTT>I haven't read it.  I haven't read Starship Troopers either which is on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 US military branches.</UTT>I did read Enders Game, but not Starship Troopers.  If the military recommends maybe it is good.</UTT>It must be.  I did see both movies though. lol  I have to get going.  It's been fun chatting with you!</UTT>1
I heard it was because of the soldiers.</UTT>I did read Enders Game, but not Starship Troopers.  If the military recommends maybe it is good.</UTT>I do.  I dont understand the moral panic of the 18th century though.</UTT>That makes a lot of sense.  I heard in England it is called the boot.</UTT>It is very useful for getting me around.  I dont know what I would do without it.</UTT>Yeah. Did you know with youtube they account of half of peak internet usage</UTT>I haven't read it.  I haven't read Starship Troopers either which is on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 US military branches.</UTT>Its a french explorer.  Antoine de la mothe Cadillac</UTT>Yeah, me too,  I always thought it was Ford who did all that, but he was the first to mass produce.</UTT>Me neither.  Reading was one of the few forms of entertainment people had back then.  Enders Game is suggested reading for many military organizations including the Marines!</UTT>Do you like reading?</UTT>That's interesting!  Do you know who the car brand Cadillac was named after?</UTT>It must be.  I did see both movies though. lol  I have to get going.  It's been fun chatting with you!</UTT>Yes.  They added them in 1975.  Did you know that the backs of cars became known as trunks because cars used to carry wooden trunks on them back in the old days?</UTT>Its a good book!  Have you read it?  I am not sure int is military reading material though,</UTT>No doubt!  Did you know when and why McDonalds added drive thrus?</UTT>Hi there!  Do you like cars?  I do because I would never get to go anywhere without one.</UTT>Yeah, carjacking must be pretty bad there.</UTT>lol  Did you hear about the flame throwing cars they have in South Africa?</UTT>Ford made the Model T in 1908 I believe?</UTT>Yes!  That is correct!</UTT>0
What do you know about the earth?</UTT>Funny you should ask, I was watching Cosmos on Netflix and learned that Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago! I wonder what people looked like back then?</UTT>Probably strands of amino acids or something</UTT>Haha, good guess! When Earth was formed, the day was only 5.5 hours long, how come one day is 24 hours now?</UTT>Who knows? Perhaps the rotation of earth changed?</UTT>Yeah, I'm already feeling out of time in 24 hour day periods, I can't imagine living on on 5 hours a day, I need my sleep!</UTT>Well sleeping for almost 3 days straight sound very restful though</UTT>A little too restful! More than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed, why do you think they are being destroyed at such rapid rates?</UTT>Well logging, clearing farmland, increasing human population to name a few</UTT>Some people believe that it has something to do with extraterrestrials! The UN even appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they ever made contact with Earth.</UTT>I mean given how vast the universe is, other life is a high possibility. However people should not shirk responsibility for destroying the natural forest by simply blaming aliens.</UTT>I agree we must preserve the environment since over 7.6 billion humans live on earth and depend on its natural resources, are you doing anything to preserve the environment?</UTT>Well my own small part. I trying to limit my use of plastic, be conscious of the business practices and sourcing of the items I use, and I helped plant trees to combat desertification in the desert</UTT>That's awesome! Where do I sign up to help plant trees? I watched a couple of documentaries on Netflix about that which led me to watch other ones and I'm a guilty contributor of taking up half of peak internet traffic with my Netflix binges.</UTT>I mean netflix is a convenient service. Considering Reed hasting built a multi billion dollar company after racking up a 40 late fee, I think the tradeoff was worth it</UTT>Very well worth it! I was also a victim of those substantial late fees, I wonder how Blockbuster feels now about declining several offers to buy Netflix at a discounted rate of $50 million dollars, how would you feel?</UTT>Well they no longer even exist to regret it lol</UTT>That's true, but as much as people love the services Netflix provide, Netflix is in huge debt in order to develop new content, they're at least two billion in debt!</UTT>Well most companies are leveraged, incuring debt today for better success tomorrow</UTT>True, is that how you feel about robots being more prevalent these days? Some people fear that with robots being able to perform tasks like deboning a chicken, these workers jobs would be taken over.</UTT>Well ideally with robots doing more work, people would be able to laze about, but clearly that is not the direction we are heading so yes, I think robots will one day be able to do all our jobs. Whether something like the matrix will happen is debatable but considering people made google's test ai into hitler within the week, it is a possibility</UTT>Yeah, it's so scary to think about. Have a good day!</UTT>1

Good evening!  It might be fun to have a President Banana in the White House right?  That was the name of Zimbabwe's first president actually, but we can dream.</UTT>That certainly would be fun!</UTT>Maybe Trump needs to follow in the footsteps of the President of Indonesia and make some pop albums.  That could be what he needs to win over some of his biggest critics.  LOL</UTT>Pop albums. With Kanye. Then declare a national emergency that requires everyone to buy a copy.</UTT>LOL!  What would it be like if the vice president was Hilary?  That is how our system was until the early 1800s.</UTT>Hillary and Trump in the WH together. They wouldn't even make eye contact.</UTT>Probably better they changed the rule.  It could make for some amazing television though!</UTT>Lots of drama! The greatest reality TV out there! Team Trump vs Team Hillary. Who will get voted out of the WH?</UTT>They play their cards right, they could release an episode everyday and maybe catch up to Pokemon's output over the course of a couple years!</UTT>I've never see Pokemon, and I don't think I ever will.</UTT>Well if you ever get into it you can binge like crazy with all of those episodes!  It seems I mostly get Thomas the Tank Engine here with my kids.  Amazing the narrators they have gotten for that show.</UTT>I guess it's a fun show to work on, and the stars really enjoy lending their talents to it. I've only seen it a bit. A lot classier than Pokemon.</UTT>The theme song is ringing in my ears already.  Maybe I should learn it on a piano?</UTT>Couldn't hurt. Find a good instrument first. Maybe the one that Freddie Mercury owned?</UTT>Is that the same one that Paul McCartney recorded Hey Jude on?  That piano has been part of some amazing rock history hasn't it?</UTT>It sure has. And perhaps if you get your hands on it, you too can contribute a song to that legacy.</UTT>I might only be successful mashing the keys.  At least I know even the best can't play "Circus Galup" which is designed to stress test those auto pianos.</UTT>I wonder who the composer was. Probably an engineering type.</UTT>Speaking of engineers, someone was able to build a 350+ pound aluminum piano that once rode in the lounge of the Hindenburg.</UTT>I bet it was a work of art, but how did it sound? Probably tinny.</UTT>It's hard to imagine it sounded like some of the better designed pianos.  Wouldn't it be something if we returned to a time when the news didn't feel that there was any news that had to be reported and played piano music instead?</UTT>No money in that. No news?! Just make some up! I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good night!</UTT>You too!</UTT>1

Do you enjoy the NBA by any chance?</UTT>The NBA is my favorite professional sports league. I am a fan of the New York Knicks & grew up idolizing Allen Iverson.</UTT>He did well for himself. He signed a contract with Reebok that would pay him $800,000 per year until age 55 and then a lump sum of $32,000,000.</UTT>Incredible. What he did for Reebok as a brand will surely not be in vain. I loved his Reebok commercial featuring the rap artist Jadakiss.</UTT>I don't remember that commercial. Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned in the NBA when they were released?</UTT>Its unbelievable, but Jordan still wore them anyway as Nike was willing to pay the fines for each game.</UTT>That makes it easy. Are you familiar with Tim Duncan?</UTT>Yes, arguably the greatest power forward of all time & greatest San Antonio Spurs player of all time.</UTT>That's him. He stayed in college for four years and sacrificed money instead of going directly into the NBA.</UTT>Yes, Tim has always stuck to his morals and core values. Even to this day after he retired from the NBA.</UTT>Glad to hear that. Did you know that Reggie Miller's sister overshadowed him in high school? She broke 8 national basketball records.</UTT>Yeah Cheryl was an outstanding high school & collegiate player. The story goes that Reggie scored 40 points in a game & was bragging about it on the way home only to learn that Cheryl scored 105 points.</UTT>Hopefully it kept him humble. Were you aware that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar got the dunk shot banned for over a decade in college because he was so successful at it?</UTT>Yeah, that is almost as shocking as learning that the inventor of basketball James Naismith is the only losing coach in the history of the University of Kansas.</UTT>That's unfortunate and not what you would expect. It kind of disgusts me that in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid government employees are college football or basketball coaches.</UTT>Absolutely, especially since college athletes don't receive a dime & are unable to hold a job.</UTT>I agree. It's ridiculous. We put too much emphasis on sports at that point. Did you know that the supreme court building has a basketball court?</UTT>Yes known as "the highest court in the land".</UTT>Ha ha. That's funny. Did you also know that there is a New Zealand basketball game?</UTT>Yes, basketball is a global sport & very popular, especially in Europe & China. Unfortunately New Zealand has a team name with racial undertones.</UTT>I heard it was called the Tall Blacks and was wondering where it came from and if it was racist.</UTT>1

How's it going? Did you know the term planet is of ancient origin tied to history, science, and other stuff?</UTT>I did not... Did you know Jupiter's moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun</UTT>Wow, Ganymede must be pretty huge if it would be a planet w/o Jupiter!</UTT>I know... The planet venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons. it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.</UTT>Uranus has a weird rotation too, it rotates sideways</UTT>Makes me giggle every time... Im so immature...</UTT>Uranus rolls around the sun instead of spinning</UTT>The sun is actually white, only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering</UTT>That makes sense, I didn't know that it was a near perfect sphere of hot plasma</UTT>At least it's not like a lightning bolt... A lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun, about 5x hotter.</UTT>That's crazy, it funny that a lightning bolt is hotter but the sun can produce enough energy in one second to meet the needs of earth for 500,000 years</UTT>On july 11th, 2011, neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846. That's a long rotation!</UTT>That's nuts. I guess there's a planet that precipitates glass</UTT>Huh, I did not know that... More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed</UTT>That sucks, only 29% of earth is land and most of the forests are gone</UTT>When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. I would not be able to get anything done!</UTT>Yea, that's fast, I heard the moon slowed down the rotation since it has gravitational interactions with Earth</UTT>Wow! In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth</UTT>That might come in handy, Astronomers detected the building blocks of life 455 light years away</UTT>Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. No more high pitched talk, sad...</UTT>Man that's sucks. If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>1

Do you  play fantasy football?</UTT>No, but I fantasize about playing football... Does that count?  Like, I imagine myself as Kellan Moore, the only left-handed QB currently in the NFL. WHat are your fantasies?</UTT>I guess it does, I dont play fantasy football so yeah, and is he the only left handed QB? interesting fact!</UTT>One of my oldtime favorites was Jim Kelley of the Bills, who was also a lefty, but Kellan is the only lefty in the game today. Do you know who are the only African-American QBs to have won the Superbowl?</UTT>I didnt know that either, only one? I guess most QB are mostly white</UTT>Two African-American QBs have won the SUperbowl: Doug Williams and Russell Wilson.</UTT>I remember Russell Wilson he was a really talented QB, Im guessing you know who Brady is</UTT>Of course. Didn't he have a TV show: The Brady Bunch? Oh, I guess that is fantasy!  Did you ever see the movie, The Dark Crystal, directed by Jim Henson?</UTT>Im not sure about that, he used to play for the Jnipero High School team, the coach benched him the whole season, I guess he though Brady had no talent</UTT>Well, Brady sure proved him wrong! You know, there is a football stadium in Allen texas that seats 18,000 and cost $60 million?  Yeah, football is big in Texas...</UTT>He did, Brady is now a hall of famer and to many the best QB of NFL history, and really $60 million!!!! wow, thats a lot of money,</UTT>I bet Brady makes a lot of money too!  The US pays big time for football players and coaches! Did you know2 that the highest paid Dept of Defense employees are football coaches?</UTT>I bet he does too, and no, thats a new fact, interesting, why would the department of defence need coaches?</UTT>They coach the service branch teams (Army, Navy, Air force). Huge stadiums at their academies too!  You know that 14 of 25 biggest stadiums are college football stadiums?</UTT>Really? college stadiums and not pro stadiums? I guess college football also moves a lot of cash,</UTT>Yeah. Big money for colleges. I like how football brings families together. Like, the rapper Snoop Dog wrote a fight song for is son's high school football team.</UTT>Snoop Dog is one of my favorite performers, football is a nice game, ESPN made one of the most valuable contributions to the game</UTT>Yeah? What would that be?</UTT>The yellow first down line, ESPN even won and award thanks to it.</UTT>Interesting world we live in where people are hailed for superimposing imaginary lines on TV screens!  Sounds like fantasy. Did you know that there is an actual university twhere a person can study Sci Fi and Fantasy literature with a concentration in Tolkien studies? Imaginary lines...Imaginary tales...</UTT>I didnt know that but if people play fantasy spelling bee I guess anything is possible,</UTT>1

Do you like horses by any chance?</UTT>I'm afraid not, my wife does though, she's actually at a barn right now!</UTT>Oh wow! Were you aware that Clint Eastwood developed a horse allergy? So surprising with all of his westerns.</UTT>I'd like it if my wife got an allergy, it would save us some money.  She told me about those Icelandic horse with the fifth speed once and showed me a video, it looks a little strange.</UTT>I'm sure it's a big expense. I honestly did not know that other horses had four speeds. Very interesting.</UTT>I guess I didn't know either.  Maybe it's because it's cold in Iceland?  Not as cold as Oymyakon, -88F, that's cold!</UTT>That's insanely cold! Do you know why Dalmatians are associated with firefighters?</UTT>I suppose they protect the horses?  To be honest I'm happier in a car, that's the only horse power I'm interested in.</UTT>Yes, they calm and protect the horses. I do not know why that particular breed does. Speaking of cars, there was a no vehicles to school day at a high school so two students rode horses and were suspended. Why would they have a day like that in the first place?</UTT>There's always this day or that day at schools.  My kids got to take stuffed animals to school today.</UTT>Yes I remember lots of weird days, but how were they all supposed to get there if no one was allowed to bring a vehicle?</UTT>I want one of those South African cars with flames throwers on the front!</UTT>What?! Why would they do that? That sounds insane.</UTT>I guess it can be a dangerous place.  I know it's not to melt the snow, I doubt they get any, aside from the mountains.</UTT>How strange. Speaking of cars, did you know that Cadillacs are named after the founder of Detroit Antoine De La Mthe Cadillac?</UTT>I did not, doesn't sound like a regular Detroit name.  I heard the name trunk comes from when the old cars had wooden trunks held on the back.</UTT>It was a French explorer. I did not know that. It sounds like a big pain to have actual wooden trunks.</UTT>So, it it cold where you are?  Not like Siberian cold, just regular cold.  I have snow at the moment.</UTT>Depends on the season. I have snow at the moment as well. This is off topic but how do you feel about fish?</UTT>Not a fishing person myself, but they can be interesting.  I like seahorses, are they fish?</UTT>They are fish and actually they are the only fish with a neck.</UTT>1
Do you like horses by any chance?</UTT>So, it it cold where you are?  Not like Siberian cold, just regular cold.  I have snow at the moment.</UTT>I'm afraid not, my wife does though, she's actually at a barn right now!</UTT>Oh wow! Were you aware that Clint Eastwood developed a horse allergy? So surprising with all of his westerns.</UTT>I'd like it if my wife got an allergy, it would save us some money.  She told me about those Icelandic horse with the fifth speed once and showed me a video, it looks a little strange.</UTT>I'm sure it's a big expense. I honestly did not know that other horses had four speeds. Very interesting.</UTT>I guess I didn't know either.  Maybe it's because it's cold in Iceland?  Not as cold as Oymyakon, -88F, that's cold!</UTT>That's insanely cold! Do you know why Dalmatians are associated with firefighters?</UTT>I suppose they protect the horses?  To be honest I'm happier in a car, that's the only horse power I'm interested in.</UTT>Yes, they calm and protect the horses. I do not know why that particular breed does. Speaking of cars, there was a no vehicles to school day at a high school so two students rode horses and were suspended. Why would they have a day like that in the first place?</UTT>There's always this day or that day at schools.  My kids got to take stuffed animals to school today.</UTT>Yes I remember lots of weird days, but how were they all supposed to get there if no one was allowed to bring a vehicle?</UTT>I want one of those South African cars with flames throwers on the front!</UTT>What?! Why would they do that? That sounds insane.</UTT>I guess it can be a dangerous place.  I know it's not to melt the snow, I doubt they get any, aside from the mountains.</UTT>How strange. Speaking of cars, did you know that Cadillacs are named after the founder of Detroit Antoine De La Mthe Cadillac?</UTT>I did not, doesn't sound like a regular Detroit name.  I heard the name trunk comes from when the old cars had wooden trunks held on the back.</UTT>It was a French explorer. I did not know that. It sounds like a big pain to have actual wooden trunks.</UTT>Depends on the season. I have snow at the moment as well. This is off topic but how do you feel about fish?</UTT>that is awesome . i spend most of the day with my pets with me in bed .</UTT>They are fish and actually they are the only fish with a neck.</UTT>0
It's crazy that the wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson.</UTT>JFK I could see but Washington and Jefferson surprise me.  I thought Washington was just a general before becoming president.</UTT>Generals maybe made a lot back then. I also think it's crazy that the president's guest house is bigger than the white house.</UTT>I know! It seems like it'd be the other way around.  Maybe when they built it they were thinking about being humble or something.</UTT>That is very possible. Did you know that until 1805 the runner up for president became the vice president.</UTT>Seems like I did hear that somewhere before. I like the idea. I think it would make for more viewpoints being heard.  What about you?</UTT>I agree that, that could be an interesting way to do things. Did you know that us congress plays a republicans vs democrats baseball game.</UTT>I do know that. I remember the shooting, I think, from last year during a practice for it.  Did you know that they have three subway lines just for them to move between the capital and their offices?</UTT>I didn't know that, but that makes sense. The crazy thing about that baseball game is it's been occurring since 1909. That's a long time to continue having a baseball game.</UTT>It really is. I think maybe they do it to try and build camraderie or something.</UTT>Sports in general seem to build camaraderie so that makes sense, but the republicans are leading by 3 wins. I'm sure that annoys the democrats.</UTT>I bet it does.  Did you know that in Nevada you can vote for none of the candidates during an election?</UTT>I did not know that and that seems kinda pointless. I think it's interesting that since 1900 taller candidates win the presidential election 75% of the time.</UTT>That is interesting.  I wonder what happened in 1900 to make the change.</UTT>Maybe back in 1900 people were closer to the same size. Has time progresses people seem to be getting taller. Walking by the middle school makes me feel short.</UTT>You could be right!  Here's an interesting tidbit.  Ancient Athens used to forbid elections because they thought it would lead to an oligarchy.</UTT>Yea, it seems like people from Ancient Athens thought a lottery was a better idea. They could have been right.</UTT>The more I look at our government today the more I think they just might have been.  so I guess that means that elections are not actually democratic.</UTT>Not if things can get rigged in someones favor, but there could have just as easily been flaws in the way that Ancient Athens did things.</UTT>True. They could have just appointed people in a certain "group" just like they can be elected now.</UTT>I agree.</UTT>Elections have only been around though since the 17th century.</UTT>1

Hello! Are you a fan of the hit blockbuster, "Hamilton?" Over 80,000 users online tried to get tickets for it on February 28, 2016.</UTT>No, I am not. How about you? I did not know it was so popular that people would not get tickets!</UTT>I'm not a fan yet either, but I am intrigued because it is so popular. The Kennedy Center (which hosted Hamilton for 14 weeks) had to change their entire system just to satisfy peoples' desires for tickets. Pretty crazy!</UTT>Many members of the Kennedy Center even came away without seats.</UTT>Yeah that's hard to believe. The highest priced tickets were $625 plus 14% fees for phone and online purchases. I can't imagine paying that for anything.</UTT>Yes, I heard that people were looking for lines so that they could purchase tickets.</UTT>Pretty insane. It seems like the process to get tickets was controversial since there were over 70,000 people interested in tickets, but they could only process 4 - 5,000 per hour. That would be an insanely stressful job.</UTT>You said you can't imagine spending that much money. Neither can I, but I cannot imagine wasting time to acquire the tickets either! And yes, processing for it seems stressful as well!</UTT>No kidding! I wouldn't wait outside in bad weather for tickets for sure. Especially since you can often find tickets on second hand marketplaces like Craigslist.</UTT>One person spent most of her 27th birthday outside of the building to get them. She even pulled an all nighter. That does not sound like my idea of a good birthday.</UTT>No thanks. I would much rather do other things on my birthday. I guess it would be okay if you got along with the people in line. One patron said it was the "most enjoyable waste of nine hours" she'd ever spent. There are so many better things I could do with nine hours of my time.</UTT>Yeah, when one person said that they were crazy for doing it, another person said it was worth it. They might be kidding themselves, if I do say so myself. But who knows, as I am not a Hamilton fan!</UTT>Are you a fan of going to the movies? I have never even heard of it, but a movie called Trojan Wars had a budget of $15 million dollars and only earned around $300 in the box office.</UTT>I am not really a fan of the movies. Are you? I kind of lose interest. I prefer series better. I really like Disney movies. Did you know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop and almost caused Disney to shut down their animation studio?</UTT>I had heard that before! I am a fan of the movies, but I don't go very often. Who is your favorite actor? I love Tom Hardy and Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is actually the highest all-time box office star.</UTT>I don't really have a favorite actor. Tom Hanks is pretty funny. Have you watched Silence of the Lambs? They were a box office success.</UTT>Yes I have! I have actually read the book too. I find it crazy that a horror movie like that was released on Valentine's Day weekend.</UTT>Yeah, can't imagine thinking it was a good idea saying to a date "Let's go watch this horror movie for Valentine's Day."</UTT>Yep definitely doesn't sound like a romantic date. I guess people enjoy things we never would. We would pass on waiting hours for tickets and we'd pass on watching gore for a holiday lol</UTT>Though, it might be a memorable Valentines Day so I don't know!</UTT>I'm not sure where you live, but I've always wondered how area codes work. In NY, the area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.</UTT>That is pretty cool. I remember having a rotary phone! I think it was past its time but my parents were too cheap to replace it. Ha.</UTT>1

I never knew Hugh Laurie was the highest paid actor in a drama.  he get $700k per episode!</UTT>That is so much money, I mean he is a good actor, but still.  I enjoyed that show he was in and I enjoy dramas in general.</UTT>i never watched House.  i didn't understand the draw to it at all.</UTT>Haha.  What about Mad Men with Jon Hamm.  Did you know he actually taught drama at one time at his old high school?</UTT>i see.  one of his students was ellie kemper from the office.</UTT>Wow, small world I guess.  Did you also know that Michael Caine only joined drama class because of the girls.  Glad he did, he is a great actor.</UTT>smart man.  also Jim Carey won't do dramas anymore because he will only play in movies that project positivity because of his beliefs.</UTT>I can respect that.  What is funny, is what we think of what drama is nowdays.  The term drama actually is dervied from a word that means Action.</UTT>cool.  i like watching all kinds of shows on Netflix these days.  Netflix accounts for 33% of all internet traffic in North America from 9pm to midnight.</UTT>Wow, I guess everyone is watching Netflix.  They have 137 million subscribers throughout the world.  That's a lot of people watching Netflix.</UTT>true.  i love Netfilx.  Netflix and YouTube represent half of all internet traffic during peak hours.</UTT>Wow, I don't spend much time on Youtube, but what amazes me is how short of a time these companies have been around.  Netflix was only founded in 1997, which really isn't that long ago.</UTT>yeah and Blockbuster could have bought Netflix for $50M and declined the offer several times.</UTT>Their mistake since the comapny is now woth 2 Billion!</UTT>yup.  i totally forgot that Netflix sued to include DVD rentals in it's subscription.  my DVD player collects dust now.</UTT>Interesting.  I didn't know that.  Funny because Netflix actually spends more money on postage than bandwidth.</UTT>funny.  and all Netflix complains about i how they have to pay to peer with ISP's like cable companies and telcos and how unfair they are treated when their services clog up available bandwidth on ISP networks.</UTT>I wonder how it affected the company when they expanded outside the US in 2010.</UTT>it's funny because the reason reed hastings decided to start netflix was because he got a $40 late fee on a VHS movie rental.  must have been pretty late!</UTT>It is amazing what inspires people to start companies.  I didn't realize that Netflix actually sold DVDs at one time but abandoned it to focus on rentals.</UTT>I love some of their original content too.  they spend tons of money on that and it is paying off.  they started producing content in 2012.</UTT>I honestly didn't know that they had been producing their own content for that long.  I heard that the first series they produced was called Lilyhammer.  I had never heard of it.</UTT>i had never heard of it either.  but i love watching Ozark.</UTT>I tired to watch that, but it wasn't for me.  Well, thanks for the chat, I think I will go watch some Netflix.</UTT>1

hey there, do you every do any shopping on amazon?</UTT>Hello, I use Amazon all the time. Its a lot cheaper to shop on there. That is if you dont mind waiting a few days for your item.</UTT>That is true. But if it need be they will deliver on sundays as well.</UTT>Yeah thats helpful. I do most of my Christmas shopping on Amazon. Everything is so much cheaper. I got my kids these 7 foot bean bags with memory foam in them for less than 200 bucks. Great deal.</UTT>They even own IMDB.</UTT>Oh yeah. Its funny how they started out as an online book store and became the worlds largest internet retailer, based on revenue and market capitalization.</UTT>Yeah and they are so busy now all the time that their warehouse workers walk 7 to 15 km a day</UTT>Thats not really surprising, I worked at a car parts factory delivering parts to the line and I pulled pallets at least 15 miles every day. I heard that Amazons first customer only spent around 30 bucks and they named a building after him. That would be cool.</UTT>yeah not too bad. the ceo of amazon built a clock in a mountain that runs for 10000 years.</UTT>Yeah that would be a facebook post if I ever saw one. Lol. Talk about making money. Facebook is right up there with Amazon in that regard.</UTT>yeah. were you ever on myspace?</UTT>I had one in the early days, can hardly even remember it though, to be honest. did hear that Myspace could have bought facebook in the early days for 75 million dollars and turned it down. Bad business decision.</UTT>That is indeed bad business. Others like iceland are using facebook to reach to people to rewrite the constitution</UTT>I think thats just crazy. I mean its a good idea but it may be giving one company too much power of persuasion over people. I know they are making the posts, but you cant tell me if facebook wanted to they couldnt put the right ads in there to persuade people the way they want them to go with it. Not that Facebook would do something like that. Just a thought.</UTT>that is true, not sure how they are going about it. do you like to read?</UTT>I dont have anything against reading. I just dont read much. Unless you count bedtime for my son. I try to read a book with him every night before bed.</UTT>that is really nice. there is a woman who holds the record for speed reading.</UTT>Thats cool. I think her record is like 4700 words per minute. I wonder how they test it to be sure she actually read all she said she did for the record.</UTT>Maybe they ask her after, what she has read? Nonetheless that is really fast.</UTT>I would say she takes a comprehension test on what she read to make sure she read that much. Yeah that is fast though.</UTT>For sure. It was nice chatting with you.</UTT>1
yeah. were you ever on myspace?</UTT>that is true, not sure how they are going about it. do you like to read?</UTT>That is true.

Hello - how are you today?</UTT>Great. Did you check out the Super Bowl?</UTT>I watched until half time. It was pretty boring. What about you?</UTT>I watched the whole thing. Looks like the only player than can beat Brady is Eli.</UTT>Lol yep. I'm not a huge fan of New England. Was really pulling for the Rams. Did you know the NFL has no written rule against women players?</UTT>What about Elisha Manning?!!</UTT>HAHA! I can't believe the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay.</UTT>Wow! No wonder Brady is hardly ever injured...no matter what Bill Belichick says</UTT>LOL yes I know.</UTT>Anyway...Eli is definitely Brady's kryptonite.</UTT>Yes that's for sure. I think it's weird that Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry in his entire life.</UTT>Who needs strawberries when you have such a great wife like Giselle?</UTT>LOL that's a good point!</UTT>She brings home the bucks too. Makes more than double of Tom. Net worth 400M</UTT>Yep, they are a very wealthy couple. I didn't know that Eli Manning has genius-level IQ.</UTT>Well I think women are smarter than men.  ;)</UTT>LOL! Not sure about that one haha. Did you know in the last 20 years of the NFL draft, only 3 that were taken number 1 overall have won the super bowl?</UTT>Yeah. Brady was number 50 or something. Kurt Warner had to go to the cfl. Then he came to the nfl and won in his first year</UTT>Yea that's a cool stat.</UTT>Almost as odd as the speed limit at ole miss</UTT>It was good talking with you!</UTT>1

how are you? do you have any interest in Space? I find Mars pretty cool, it was named after the Roman god of war</UTT>Hi, how are you? Mars is interesting. Sounds have a higher pitch there than on Earth because of the atmosphere.</UTT>Yea it has a very thin atmosphere, makes sense</UTT>The sunsets on Mars are blue. I wonder who wants to be part of the Mars colonization project in 2023.</UTT>Well I know lichens and cyanobacteria would thrive on mars so I'm sure they'd like to go</UTT>Maybe they should go first. We need to work out kinks in the system. Lockheed Martin was still using feet and miles and caused a satellite to crash.</UTT>Lol, that's  bad Locheed Martin was using the imperial system while Nasa used the metric</UTT>What scientists use the imperial system? Strange. NASA is American and they use metric.</UTT>I really don't even see how the satalite was even able to launch if Lokheed was using the imperial system</UTT>Probably NASA handled the launch, while Lockheed handled the satellite release at Mars. I didn't know that Mars is the second smallest in the solar system. I wonder if it's a comfortable place to live.</UTT>Probably not with all the iron oxide that gives it it's reddish apperance</UTT>There is a thin atmosphere, so it's got that going for it. I would only take 2 to 3 days to get to Mars at 1g acceleration. I wonder whether we'll have the technology soon</UTT>I don't know, i guess the US government hasn't come close yet at least according to wikileaks, all they published were the US governement's plan to destroy wikileaks</UTT>Wikileaks really is a thorn in the side of the US gov't. The US gov't owns 86% of the land in Nevada. I wonder how much it's worth.</UTT>I don't know, maybe the man who sold a government official and sold the Eiffel tower twice should try selling it</UTT>He should be a politician.</UTT>Or he could try being an actor, he could audition as the president, he'd probably do better than Reagan did in his audition as president</UTT>LOL! I wonder what was behind the US legislation protecting gov't employees for violating the Geneva conventions. Sounds fishy.</UTT>I guess the US doesn't want it's military under the jurisdiction of the UN or geneva conventions</UTT>I guess the gov't was planning for atrocities or something. I like that Norway's gov't donated to help save the Amazon.</UTT>Yea but I hope more countries contribute too, Norway's $1bn doesn't seem like enough</UTT>It isn't. Plus Norway has a ton of money from petroleum. And guess what environmental problems oil causes? Norway acknowledges its responsibility.</UTT>Yea, I guess so. Well I have to go, nice talking with you</UTT>1
how are you? do you have any interest in Space? I find Mars pretty cool, it was named after the Roman god of war</UTT>Hi, how are you? Mars is interesting. Sounds have a higher pitch there than on Earth because of the atmosphere.</UTT>Yea, I guess so. Well I have to go, nice talking with you</UTT>Yea it has a very thin atmosphere, makes sense</UTT>The sunsets on Mars are blue. I wonder who wants to be part of the Mars colonization project in 2023.</UTT>Well I know lichens and cyanobacteria would thrive on mars so I'm sure they'd like to go</UTT>Maybe they should go first. We need to work out kinks in the system. Lockheed Martin was still using feet and miles and caused a satellite to crash.</UTT>Lol, that's  bad Locheed Martin was using the imperial system while Nasa used the metric</UTT>What scientists use the imperial system? Strange. NASA is American and they use metric.</UTT>I really don't even see how the satalite was even able to launch if Lokheed was using the imperial system</UTT>Probably NASA handled the launch, while Lockheed handled the satellite release at Mars.

Good morning, are you a football fan?</UTT>Hi there. I really don't enjoy it, but I went to a big football college in the SEC, so I'm familiar enough haha.</UTT>The SEC sure loves their football! The schools have to bring in some much money from those games.</UTT>They do, mostly from the broadcasting rights. The behind the scenes action can be pretty interesting, too--for example, the University of Iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink.</UTT>I wonder if they thought it would give them an advantage psychologically? I can't see that working though.</UTT>If anything it's going to give the visiting team more motivation, right? I wonder if teams of the variations of football in other countries try similar tactics.</UTT>I think at the highest level of sports that athletes are so tuned in that the only thing that might throw them off is their own mistake or the refs.</UTT>Yes, for example, former Patriots QB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled in his NFL career.</UTT>That's an amazing stat and he had one of the best nicknames ever, The Law Firm.</UTT>That's certainly an interesting one; was it a reference to his offensive abilities?</UTT>It was because his name sounded like a law firm haha. The Law Firm of Ben-Jarvis Green-Ellis.</UTT>Yeah, that would make for a confusing on-air name as a broadcaster if people thought it was an advertisement, especially on the radio haha.</UTT>Yes it would, it wasn't used a ton just to bring a little humor into the broadcast.</UTT>It would probably read easier on a platform like facebook--I don't think they have a character limit for names.</UTT>I've never really explored that, my name isn't very long to begin with so I never ran into that issue.</UTT>The site does have some interesting quirks; for example, the primary color is blue because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind</UTT>I remember an NFL game where the two teams wore red and green jerseys. A lot of people who suffered from that complained because they could not tell who were on what team.</UTT>That's funny--maybe it's part of why a home team wears white a lot of the time. I don't think many NCAA teams have green as a color, although a lot have red, like Ohio State.</UTT>Yeah this was a special game where they were testing Color Rush jerseys that were primarily one color. That's why so many people had trouble because there were no breaks in the color or noticeable logos.</UTT>I guess they make some choices to make things easier on the viewers; for example, ESPN actually won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line shown on TV.</UTT>That was a great invention that made watching the game a lot easier! It was fun talking football with you, have a great day!</UTT>1

Do you like going to the movies?</UTT>Yes crazy rich asians was good</UTT>I saw that movie. I thought it was pretty funny also. Typical romantic comedy type stuff.</UTT>yea. what other movies do you like?</UTT>I usually like fantasy or science fiction movies. Mostly the big box office hits.</UTT>I think the comedy films are great too. Surprised about evan almighty</UTT>Yes I do like comedy. Bill Murray is a favorite actor of mine.</UTT>did you know Evan almighty was the most expensive comedy film made</UTT>Did you know 3rd Rock from the Sun beat out Seinfeld for the Golden GLobe award?</UTT>I did not know that what article is that from?</UTT>I'm not sure. But Silence of the Lambs came out on Valentin'es Day. That's crazy,</UTT>wow was that done on purpose?</UTT>Not the kind of movie I would take someone on Valentine's Day.</UTT>I think it was funny Green Lantern was suppose to star Jack Black</UTT>Wow I never would have thought that. Where did you read that?</UTT>from fact section here</UTT>Hollywood is interesting. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star?</UTT>Yes I did. He had many cool movies.</UTT>Are you a fan of Disney movies?</UTT>OMG yes. I cant wait for all the remakes</UTT>Disney actually considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty bombed at box office.</UTT>well it was nice talking to you</UTT>same</UTT>bye now</UTT>1

hi how are you? what do you think of the presidency?</UTT>Hey I'm good thanks. I think it is a very stressful job! Being the head of the government is no easy task.</UTT>It is not easy. everyone second guesses you and everyone complains. I would not want the job.</UTT>Yes me as well. Too much stress. I wonder how banana did, the first president in Zimbabwe!</UTT>That must have been a terrible job, unless the guy was totally corrupt, in which case it was a great job</UTT>Agreed. Did you know that the guest house for the president is bigger than the white house itself?</UTT>I bet Trump is very pleased at those arrangements. He could probably rent out the guest house. Put a TRUMP sign on it. LOL</UTT>Haha I could see that happening. Fox news would likely cover that story! Fox News once thought about creating a channel airing only The Simpsons!</UTT>That would be overkill. no need for a whole channel. they could just set up a website.</UTT>Exactly. You should work for Fox News lol. The Fox News Network was created by Richard Ailes, a republican media strategist.</UTT>Yeah, he and Nixon decided they needed conservative ideas on the air. I guess it is a propaganda machine.</UTT>Unfortunately yes it is. It is broadcasted in 86 countries surprisingly.</UTT>I guess they change it around for local content but people want to hear about the US. I dont know how many people believe what they hear, but they watch.</UTT>Yes they do. They even threatened to sue the Simpsons (even though they wanted to make a Simpsons channel).</UTT>I think the right hand didnt know what the far, far right hand was doing there. LOL</UTT>Haha yeah definitely. That channel covers the US Senate quite a bit. I think it is interesting each state has 2 senators regardless of population.</UTT>Yes, they have a lot of power too. much more than representatives. 6 years, plus lots of support.</UTT>Yes well said. Richard Nixon cracked a gavel that was used by the Senate for 165 years! He must have been strong...or the gavel weak!</UTT>He was a determined man, and wanted to bust that gavel! Many had tried and failed, but he succeeded! Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Crazy that woman couldn't wear pants on the senate floor until 1993. But yes great chatting with you too. Have a great night my friend.</UTT>Have a good night!</UTT>Bye!</UTT>1

Did you watch Johnny English Strikes Again?</UTT>Is that the film with Mr. Bean?</UTT>Yeah the same one, it has Mr. Bean as the leading actor.</UTT>Nope haven't seen it, is it any good?</UTT>I havent seen it either, the first part was really funny so I might watch the sequel, I think Im waiting until it comes out in Bluerray or Netflix at least</UTT>Cool, I might check it out but speaking of Netflix have you seen that new horror series "The Kingdom"?</UTT>No I havent seen them, what is ''The Kingdom'' about?</UTT>It's about zombies? Like zombies?</UTT>Zombies really? the name sure doesnt fit the description lol, and Im not much of a fan in fact I hate horror films</UTT>I love them, Netflix has such a huge collection, can't stop watching them.</UTT>Well its a good thing that you like them as you can burn a lot of calories just by watching a horror film</UTT>That's new to me, did you know E.T. was originally suppose to be a horror movie?</UTT>It was? good thing it wasnt E.T. is one of my favorite fellows lol, do you like abstract art? well pay attention to it after watching a movie and you will like it more</UTT>I don't like abstract art much but I see it everywhere on Facebook!</UTT>Oh I see, how long have you had a Facebook account?</UTT>About a year, I really stopped using it lately because a third of all divorce filings in 2011 contained the word Facebook.</UTT>Yeah I guess Facebook does make couples fight each other, its also being used to rewrite the constitution of countries, like for Iceland</UTT>Yep 30% of American adults get their news there as well.</UTT>I see, did you know that MySpace had an offer to buy Facebook for lilke $75 million,</UTT>No, but I know there are more people on Facebook than there were in the world 200 years ago!</UTT>Really? well that makes sense, almost everyone has an account now.</UTT>1

I learned recently that Mcdonalds' added the drive-thru for soldiers who couldn't get out of their cars wearing fatigues.</UTT>Thats very nice of them,  and to think now we can all benefit from it.  I love the drive thru.  Not just at mc donalds,  but like walgreens and cvs too.</UTT>Yeah, I bet it didn't take long for everyone else to say "I want to use the drive-thru too!"</UTT>Right,  especially moms with like a million children lol</UTT>lol true, hey do you know how the trunk on your car got its name?</UTT>Those large trunks people used to keep their clothes and belonging in used to be tied to the back of cars.  What a hassle lol</UTT>Having a real truck built into your car is definitely better then a wooden one tied down to the back.</UTT>I know right.  My grandparents had a bunch of trunks,  they were ridiculously heavy.</UTT>Did you know this crazy fact:  In South Africa it is legal to have a flamethrower in your car to prevent car jacking?</UTT>That is crazy,  must be a serious problem.  There isnt any other way to protect your car?  lol thats really extreme.</UTT>It is.  Gas tanks and flame throwers....what could go wrong???</UTT>lol you're right,  I am totally over reacting.  That could come in handy in snowy areas though lol</UTT>We just got 4 more inches of snow here.  I could use one for my driveway!</UTT>Nice!  What are of the us do you live?  Im in Ca and tahoe has been getting dumped on,  I could use a flame thrower on my day trips to go snowboarding lol</UTT>Maine, and I am ready for spring!  Snow is nice in December but by March I am sick of it.</UTT>lol I hear ya,  I dont live in the snow but I can see how it would be annoying,  expecially the digging your car out of the snow.  How cold has it been lately?</UTT>not bad the last few days highs around 30 though later in the week the lows are going to be around 0</UTT>Yikes.  Thats cold.  Do you have any good skiing or snowboarding there in maine?</UTT>in western Maine but i am closer to the coast. I love going to the ocean in the summer</UTT>Oh I see,  where all the crab is?  lol</UTT>Yeah, Hey did you know a con-man in France pretending to be a government official sold the Eiffel Tower?</UTT>yeah that guy had to be super convincing lol Its been good chatting with you.</UTT>1

Hey, are you a Trump fan?</UTT>Hi! That is a hard question. I think he's arrogant and a jerk but I do like some of his ideas. Are you?</UTT>I too, he is not this genius he talks about, he is a complete idiot, sorry</UTT>Haha! Do you know who the only US president was to have a PhD?</UTT>I do not know, who is it?</UTT>Woodrow Wilson</UTT>That is so interesting, you would expect more! Did you know that JFK , washington, and jefferson were the richest presidents ever?</UTT>Oh wow! Do you know what an alternative name for our planet is?</UTT>I am not sure, what is it? the blue planet??</UTT>Besides Gaia, it is also known as tellus and telluris.</UTT>that is interesting! Did you know that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet of it orbited the sun?</UTT>Oh wow that's pretty cool! Did you know that you could fit every other planet between the earth and the moon?</UTT>I did not know that! My mind is blown! I know that astronomers detected building blocks of life in a system 455 light years away</UTT>Woah! There is also a planet that orbits four stars.</UTT>Wow, I bet in North Korea, they think the whole world orbits them. Kim Jong-un probably told them that!</UTT>That is funny! I'm not too familiar with him. But I know he is young. He was born January 8, 1983.</UTT>The onion voted him the sexiest man alive, which was a complete joke, but China believed it!</UTT>Gross haha! He is the grandson of the first leader of North Korea.</UTT>Yea and a complete lunatic. He killed off most of his own family.</UTT>That's sad. I wonder how long he will stay a leader.</UTT>Hopefully not long, good chatting with you!</UTT>1

Jordan Peele's Get Out is truly deserving of an Oscar nomination, in my opinion! He made history as a writer and director with the film after all!</UTT>Yes. Have you seen that movie?</UTT>I have and I loved it! Hard to believe Peele is only the fifth black director to be nominated! That is insane!!</UTT>Yeah. I am assuming that has to do with the limited opportunities black directors have in hollywood. I wonder how many great films we have missed out on due to racism?</UTT>That is so true. In fact, Peele was also the first African American writer to be nominated for best original screenplay in nearly 25 years. He is truly breaking down racial barriers!</UTT>Yeah. He is really talented to. Key gave him a lot of credit for the success of key and peele.</UTT>Agreed. Are you a fan of horror movies by chance? I enjoy them because it's a great work out as you can burn up to 180 calories just by watching one.</UTT>Wow. I do not like them but will incorporate them into my workouts!</UTT>It is a great work out for sure! Heck, Stephen King said the first horror movie he ever watched as a kid was Bambi and it terrified him. That's kind of funny.</UTT>I remember being really upset when I watched it with my parents. I do not think they knew that was coming when we watched it. I was a wreck!</UTT>I never saw it, honestly. I should one of these days. Maybe I can find it on Netflix. I'm one of many North Americans who contribute to Netflix accounting for 33% of all bandwidth after 9:00pm each night.</UTT>Do you also use YouTube?</UTT>Yeah, I'm one who also contributes to both YouTube and Netflix accounting for half the peak internet traffic. Lol</UTT>Blockbuster turned down a deal for Netflix for $50M. What a bad decision!</UTT>I know, right? Huge mistake considering Netflix is worth 2 billion now! You know they'll forever have to live with that mistake!</UTT>And there's only 1 blockbuster left in the US. It's in alaska! Seems like a huge problem for them. I wonder if their website is still up?</UTT>That's a great question! I'm glad Reed Hastings had a $40 late fee for a silly overdue VHS, otherwise we probably wouldn't have Netflix today! So are you into the history of the Academy Awards?</UTT>None of this would be possible without the annoyance of Reed. Thank you blockbuster for being rude!</UTT>So true! I'm also glad Netflix started releasing their own series starting with Lilyhammer. Perhaps one day the actors in their films can beat Daniel Day-Lewis' best actor record at the Oscars!</UTT>Walt Disney has 22 oscars! That's a record!</UTT>Indeed! And that's extremely hard to believe. It's also crazy knowing Eminem, a musician, had won more Oscars than Bill Murray, Leo, Will Smith, Depp and Lucas combined!</UTT>Nice chatting with you!</UTT>1
And there's only 1 blockbuster left in the US. It's in alaska! Seems like a huge problem for them. I wonder if their website is still up?</UTT>Blockbuster turned down a deal for Netflix for $50M. What a bad decision!</UTT>I know, right? Huge mistake considering Netflix is worth 2 billion now! You know they'll forever have to live with that mistake!</UTT>I never saw it, honestly. I should one of these days. Maybe I can find it on Netflix. I'm one of many North Americans who contribute to Netflix accounting for 33% of all bandwidth after 9:00pm each night.</UTT>That's a great question! I'm glad Reed Hastings had a $40 late fee for a silly overdue VHS, otherwise we probably wouldn't have Netflix today! So are you into the history of the Academy Awards?</UTT>Yes. Have you seen that movie?</UTT>Man I will have to travel there sometime. Have you heard about Mackinac island in michigan?</UTT>Indeed! And that's extremely hard to believe. It's also crazy knowing Eminem, a musician, had won more Oscars than Bill Murray, Leo, Will Smith, Depp and Lucas combined!</UTT>I remember being really upset when I watched it with my parents. I do not think they knew that was coming when we watched it. I was a wreck!</UTT>That is so true. In fact, Peele was also the first African American writer to be nominated for best original screenplay in nearly 25 years. He is truly breaking down racial barriers!</UTT>None of this would be possible without the annoyance of Reed. Thank you blockbuster for being rude!</UTT>Nice chatting with you!</UTT>I have and I loved it! Hard to believe Peele is only the fifth black director to be nominated! That is insane!!</UTT>So true! I'm also glad Netflix started releasing their own series starting with Lilyhammer. Perhaps one day the actors in their films can beat Daniel Day-Lewis' best actor record at the Oscars!</UTT>Yeah. He is really talented to. Key gave him a lot of credit for the success of key and peele.</UTT>Wow. I do not like them but will incorporate them into my workouts!</UTT>Yeah. I am assuming that has to do with the limited opportunities black directors have in hollywood. I wonder how many great films we have missed out on due to racism?</UTT>It is a great work out for sure! Heck, Stephen King said the first horror movie he ever watched as a kid was Bambi and it terrified him. That's kind of funny.</UTT>Yeah, I'm one who also contributes to both YouTube and Netflix accounting for half the peak internet traffic. Lol</UTT>Agreed. Are you a fan of horror movies by chance? I enjoy them because it's a great work out as you can burn up to 180 calories just by watching one.</UTT>Jordan Peele's Get Out is truly deserving of an Oscar nomination, in my opinion! He made history as a writer and director with the film after all!</UTT>Walt Disney has 22 oscars! That's a record!</UTT>0
Good afternoon to you. Do you use Google very often?It was founded in 1998.</UTT>Hello!  Yes, I use Google extremely often, I find.  I am always online in one way or another and constantly looking things up.</UTT>Awesome me too. A single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon!</UTT>That is an amazing statement.  I had to think about that, how primitive things were back then.  It's wild that we have so much computing power at our fingertips.</UTT>Yes we are so lucky. Google even determines the traffic for us by tracking android devices.</UTT>I recently read that Google figures out traffic patterns based on how fast the phones are moving around in the world!  I think that is kind of fun to visualize!  It amuses me.</UTT>Yes it is very fun to visualize. Google even uses goats to eat/trim their lawns around the headquarters.</UTT>That really gets my goat!  ha ha ha.  That is so cute.  I wonder if Google did that to make themselves seem more personable, quirky, friendly...something like that.</UTT>Yes I would like to know about the reasoning as well. In 2013 Google went down for about five minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it. That goes to show how many people use Google.</UTT>Yes, it is scarily ubiquitous, and I do have many privacy concerns.  Alphabet, it's owner, is such a huge corporate conglomerate, with Sundar Pichai heading it up.</UTT>Yes I am concerned about privacy as well. Google has a lot of power. When there is a disputed border, Google maps tailors its maps to the claim of each country where the Internet browser is located.</UTT>I found that to be fascinating.  The implications are enormous.  They are involved so deeply with our lives.  I'm concerned, sure, but that being said - I just bought a new phone today, true story.</UTT>Yes they really are. Congrats on the new phone. Do you hook up your phone in your car? Cars first came in the global use during the 20th century.</UTT>I don't own a car right now.  So my phone is my wheels, using Uber or Lyft.  It's essential to me, and I have to have a decent one.  My last phone, a Google branded phone, is too old and heats up too much.</UTT>Oh nice will at least you have that! Hopefully this one will stay cool. Do you play video games on your phone? A guy named John Mardenborough became a pro race car driver by beating people in Gran Turismo.</UTT>I love to play games, mostly word games, I am wordy type of person, a reader, a lifelong learner, at least I hope so.  The technologies available give me absolutely stunning, beautiful games on my phone and my home computer.</UTT>Oh that's cool. Did you know the trunk of the cars called the boot because old cars used to have actual wooden trunks on the back.</UTT>You know, when they were inventing the car back in 1886, maybe they should have thought of that!  Obviously people want to take their stuff with them everywhere they go!</UTT>Yes very cool!I think the Mercedes brand is prestigous because their creator is known as the inventor of the modern car! It was great chatting with you today.</UTT>I really enjoyed it.  I'm so happy today, as I am getting my new phone and I will now be able to travel more safely and securely.  I can't imagine traveling without it, can you?</UTT>Nope I definitely can't. My phone is in my car and everywhere I go! Have a good one thanks again for the chat :) Bye!</UTT>Yes, you've really got no choice if you want to live in the modern world.  Bye to you - thank you!</UTT>See ya!</UTT>1

I have learned that a CNN person thinks that Kellyanne Conway is wrong when she says, "No evidence of collusion"  Big surprise that a CNN person would assert that!</UTT>Well, I was hoping not to enter into politics, but , I think Kellyane Conway is a politic figure.</UTT>Yes.  She is.  She is the President's spokesperson.  I suppose the researchers want to see how we handle the subject.  Four our of 10 Trump supporters gets news from FOX.  That is described as source loyalty, but it also means that 6 out of 10 do not.</UTT>Yes, I was surprised about the topics today, did you know that JFK, Washington and Jefferson were the 3 most wealthiest presidents? I wonder how JFK made his money, do you happen to know?</UTT>JFK inherited it.  His dad sold liquor during prohibition by importing it from Europe.  I would think that Trump would be in the top 3. I am glad it is not like 1805 where the VP was the person who came in second.</UTT>Hahaha, thank you, I am glad that you knew. Well, it seems that it paid off to be selling liquor then. Would be like selling drugs now?</UTT>I don't think it was looked down on quite as much, but it was illegal.  It is also amusing that a president of a country would be called president banana.</UTT>Yes, the President of Zimbabwe, I wonder why the choose the word banana. And I wonder too, why the President´s gues hourse is larger than the White House. To give more status?</UTT>I suspect it has to do with when it was built.  The White House is very old.  Can you imagine a cable channel that only broadcasts "The Simpsons?"</UTT>Hahaha my ex husband would had loved it, lol, do you like to make purchases in Amazon?</UTT>I am a Prime member and shop there several times per month.  Imagine being the first customer and getting a building named after you.</UTT>Yes, for 27 dlls, cool! I would had prefered to have packages delivered to my door for free per life, I didn´t know that Ali Baba is richer than Amazon.</UTT>The market in China is just so large and potentially larger as the nation's wealth grows.  I admire Bezos for growing Amazon from just books.</UTT>I admire him for the idea that had. And I would love to be an amazon warehouse worker, I need to lose weight and walking daily 7 or 15 miles each day would be wonderful, getting paid for be thinner.</UTT>I live in Phoenix, so I would hope that the warehouse was air conditioned.  They, like Netflix, now make their own shows for streaming.</UTT>That would be so cool, love Netflix too. I am amazed to see that USP is working just for amazon to deliver packages on Sundays, amazing, what a strong company!</UTT>Great fortune for the Post Office.  Regular mail volume goes down due to email and the Amazon package delivery volume increases a lot.</UTT>You are right, you are pretty intelligent. I happen to own a kindle fire, I just love it! you can read about somebody´s history, if they mention where they were, you can actually see the place, if they mention the music that they were listening, you can listen it, love it! marvellous gadget!</UTT>Wow!  I did not know that Kindle could do so much.  Our computing power is so great nowadays that we are only limited by our imagination.  It is surprising how much innovation comes from newer companies and the older ones try to keep selling buggy whips.</UTT>Well, I highly recommend it to you, I was reading about Juana the Crazy, Queen of Spain and they  mentioned the Alhambra and the song that she was listening, and it makes you feel more into it. Nice to meet you, giving you an excellent.</UTT>Thanks. Enjoyed it too.</UTT>1

Have you heard any good albums lately?</UTT>I love The Darkside of the Moon. Even though it was released over 40 years ago it was the bestseller in 2014.</UTT>That is a great album, do you like the band Linkin Park?</UTT>Yes it was a great album. I do like Linkin Park. Do you?</UTT>I also like the band, my favorite album is The Hybrid Theory, a lot of good songs in that album.</UTT>Yeah I've heard that album is the best selling album of the 21st Century.</UTT>Yeah the best selling album really nice and with a lot of cool singles, God I love that band.</UTT>Can you believe that NWA's album Straight Outta Compton was the first album to reach platinum status without the band going on tour?</UTT>It was? I thought that was a really good album I really liked it, I guess the group had many fans.</UTT>It certainly gained the attention it needed. I am surprised that two identical twins aged 100 put out a rap album in 1992.</UTT>I guess its never too late to follow your dream that must be a funny thing to watch though I wonder if they made a musical video of one of their songs.</UTT>If they did it would be fun to see. I wonder if they'll get recognition like Tupac. His music is in the Library of Congress as having cultural significance.</UTT>I guess Tupac is one of the greatest artists ever too bad he died at a young age and in the way he did.</UTT>A true legend. Eminem's dream before he became a rapper was to be a comic book artist. I'd love to see any of his art.</UTT>I wonder if his talented, do you know who Busta Rhymes is?</UTT>I have heard of him. Why?</UTT>He is the voice of the Reptar Wagon in the Rugrats movie, that movie was premiered back in 1998.</UTT>Oh, I never knew that! I'll have to re-watch it now that I know. Isn't is crazy that a MI judge gave a ruling in a trial against Eminem in the version of a rap?</UTT>That is crazy and also really unprofessional I bet she got grounded because of that, giving a ruling like that can be biased.</UTT>I'm not sure. It was a long time ago, in 2001. So who know what the rules were?</UTT>You have a good point I think I will Google that now, its been awesome chatting with you today.</UTT>Yes, nice chatting with you too! Thank you.</UTT>1

Hello, do you happen to have a pet?</UTT>No, I don't own a pet. I do like dogs, though. Do you own a pet?</UTT>I have a dog, its interesting how there about 12 different blood types, my dog is a donor and I never knew this fact.</UTT>I've heard that there are dog blood drives. I guess the dogs are ok with having a needle in their leg.</UTT>I guess so, some of them might be afraid, you know Google prefers dogs over cats, they are a dog company.</UTT>It's probably easier to manage dogs in an office space. Cats won't stay put.</UTT>I agree but cats spend like 66% of their lives sleeping, when they reach the age of 15 they have spent 10 of those years sleeping.</UTT>When they're asleep, they're easy to manage. Once they're awake, they wander and explore. Cats would be great if they would sit at a computer and surf the Internet. Istanbul has vending machines that reward dogs for collecting recycled bottles.</UTT>I wonder if thats an effective system, I think it might work and its a way to reduce costs for sure.</UTT>I've never been to a cat cafe. There are many of them in Japan and Taiwan. I guess the cats get along with each other and don't have a problem with people trying to pet them.</UTT>Yeah I guess cats are popular in those countries, there is an author that published his cat as the coauthor of his book.</UTT>I think he wanted to use the word "we" in the paper, so he included his cat as an author. I wonder how a cat got to be the mayor of a town.</UTT>I bet the other politicians were really bad lol, still think mayor Stubbs will do a better work than most politicians.</UTT>A cat couldn't really do much harm. Sleeps most of the time. Rest of the time they hunt. Cats have eliminated the bird species of specific areas, even caused extinction.</UTT>They have? wow that is suprising, you know the cat in godfather 1 was actually a strayed one.</UTT>It was a pretty well-behaved cat. I don't think cats will ever be called  "man's best friend" but they sure come close.</UTT>I dont think that either, you know dogs are actually not color blind, they can also see colors but not in the way we do.</UTT>I'm not surprised. I suspect that many animals can see color, just not like human beings For example, I expect that cats can see color as well.</UTT>I see, I didnt know cats could also see colors that is surprising to me!</UTT>Cats probably also have many different blood types. I wonder whether they have blood drives the same as for dogs.</UTT>I bet there are, I mean there are a lot of people who love cats so its really probable.</UTT>1

I wonder how a cat got to be the mayor of a town.</UTT>I dont think that either, you know dogs are actually not color blind, they can also see colors but not in the way we do.</UTT>I have a dog, its interesting how there about 12 different blood types, my dog is a donor and I never knew this fact.</UTT>Cats probably also have many different blood types. I wonder whether they have blood drives the same as for dogs.</UTT>I guess so, some of them might be afraid, you know Google prefers dogs over cats, they are a dog company.</UTT>I bet the other politicians were really bad lol, still think mayor Stubbs will do a better work than most politicians.</UTT>I see, I didnt know cats could also see colors that is surprising to me!</UTT>I'm not surprised. I suspect that many animals can see color, just not like human beings For example, I expect that cats can see color as well.</UTT>0
hi do you know much about animals?</UTT>Yes. Do you know how many animals are there individually</UTT>THere are 20 quintillion but do not ask me how many zeros are in that number</UTT>Haha I know right? Do you have a pet?</UTT>I do, Did you know they can develop white patches in the forehead?</UTT>Yeah but I have not seen them in my pet so not sure about that</UTT>Yeah I guess. In Germany the constitution protects the animals</UTT>I like that we should adopt laws like that here too</UTT>Yeah I agree. Do you know why we have hiccups?</UTT>Yesh they are just a holdover from when animals had lungs and gills</UTT>Yeah. Do you know much about humans?</UTT>Yeah I know that we have lost out hair just a quarter a million years ago</UTT>Yeah. Do you know why we are good persistence runners?</UTT>Because we used to be hunters and are used to that</UTT>Yeah. Did you know we can regrow ribs?</UTT>Yes in 2-3 months and just as strong, out bodies are amazing</UTT>I know. There is a frequency though that scares us</UTT>Yeah I wonder what it sounds though, I am curious</UTT>Yeah me too actually. Did you know we cannot synthesize vitamin C and doing that are the only ones that cannot?</UTT>Yeah all the other animals have that ability . Do you know why?</UTT>Yes they have the right enzyme to help them do that</UTT>1

Do you like basketball?</UTT>I do. My favorite team is the Golden State warriors. What about you?</UTT>I like the Lakers</UTT>Did you know that the Golden State Warriors are planning to move to San Francisco?</UTT>Any reason in particular?</UTT>I am not sure, maybe financial incentives to move there. Do you know why?</UTT>Not sure</UTT>Who is your favorite basketball player? Mine is Steph Curry.</UTT>Ah Steph curry is a great choice</UTT>Did you know that he did not receive any scholarships from any major colleges?</UTT>What a shame given his performance as such a great shooter</UTT>I agree, back then Steph Curry also wanted to play at Virginia Tech.</UTT>I wonder if akron ohio is a basketball state. Both lebron james and steph curry were born there</UTT>I would assume so. Both of those players are star players, some of the best the world has to offer!</UTT>I agree. It is a shame though how curry makes only the 5th highest salary</UTT>He should go and renew his contract with another team. I am sure that many teams out there would be willing to pay large sums of money for him.</UTT>True, but who knows how he will perform in another team</UTT>Agreed, Steph Curry does have very good synergies with his current team.</UTT>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to chat.</UTT>Thank you too, it was a lot of fun!</UTT>Have a wonderful day.</UTT>1

The president sure does an important job</UTT>Some might say he does a bad job at an important job lol. It's too bad there's not a backup to balance out his worse impulses; until 1805, the runner-up in the election became VP. One can only wonder how Hillary Clinton would influence decisions with her perspective.</UTT>It would be a mess to have her as vice president, she doesnt get along with Trump and both have opposing views</UTT>Trump is a reality star. Maybe he would prefer sticking to entertainment, releasing some pop albums like the president of Indonesia.</UTT>I know right, and he should I would support him if it means he will leave office</UTT>He could make more money off his supporters with the album sales; God knows he's not as rich as he says he is. The 3 wealthiest presidents were actually JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.</UTT>He has filled bankrupcy many times so that makes sense, JFK is the richest one in history?</UTT>I'm sure he's in the top 3 because of his family, not slavery like the other 2. You don't make much money as a congressman or a Senator like he was.</UTT>At least not enough to beat the other two, interesting fact about the senate and they didnt allow woman to wear pants in the senate floor until the year 1993</UTT>They are sticklers for tradition. Did you know they used the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon cracked it? Seems like an omen haha.</UTT>It does lol, the candy desk tradition began on 1968, thats a tasty and sweet tradition</UTT>Yes, it is. Some people aren't so big on tradition, though; Teddy Roosevelt was so into conservationism that he banned Christmas trees from the White House.</UTT>He banned them? that is terrible, its a tradition important to many</UTT>Well, some people hate moving forward too--Reagan removed the solar panels installed on the White House by Carter, but eventually George W. Bush had some put back on.</UTT>Its a good thing Bush placed them back, solar energy is the future, did you hear about the incident with the secret service back in 2011?</UTT>Yes, it's crazy that it took them 4 days to realize bullets had struck the White House!</UTT>4 days, really crazy!! I bet someone got fired that day</UTT>I wonder how they haven't fired the IT person who's allowed floppy drives to stay in use for storing some of the files in the White House. Maybe it's for data security.</UTT>I think its for data security yeah, it must be difficult to hack one of those</UTT>Yeah, they're not easy to copy. Did you know that there are actual copies of the White House itself in Ireland and France?</UTT>I didnt know that, they must be interesting buildings, I wonder if they have the same size as the White House and also wonder who lives there</UTT>1

hey did you hear about the baseball player who died in WWI?</UTT>Good Evening - I have not heard about the ball player who died in WWI.  I'm a huge baseball fan and would like to learn more!</UTT>ya his name was Eddie Grant and he was actually in hte World Series back in 1913</UTT>Baseball history is fascinating and there's always stories like this out there waiting to be told.  I know they canceled seasons so the players could go fight, but beyond Ted Williams, don't know much about those players</UTT>ya I haven't followed it that deeply, but its crazy that the Cubs were teh first team to win World Series' back to back! thats impressive</UTT>They had a pretty long drought after that back2back too!  I'm pretty excited to get this season started - been to a few Spring Training games and going to another one on Saturday</UTT>This season should definitely be interesting. what's shocking to me though is that the Women's World Cup has higher ratings than the World Series, I don't know who watches soccer personally</UTT>We watch it because my daughter plays and Alex Morgan is grrrreat!  But we also watch the men's WC and of course the World Series, and go to a ton more baseball games than soccer, but we don't have an MLS team either</UTT>well to each their own haha! I don't watch baseball personally, but it is crazy that the baseball managers can actually play for the team if they needed to! That's why they wear uniforms</UTT>Yep and I've seen the umpire check a manager for proper uniform under his jacket to be sure everything was copacetic - ump show!  Pete Rose was the last true player/manager I can remember, would never actually happen today</UTT>Haha that's cool! what do you think about Canadians calling kickball soccer-baseball? that name seems really dumb haha</UTT>Seems clunky - kickball makes sense and describes the sport pretty accurately I think.  Why don't they call hockey soccer-ice skating with sticks?</UTT>Haha I like that idea! What do you think about husband and wife combo they used to schedule all of the MLB games? They would schedule about 2500 games a year, I bet they were busy all the time!</UTT>I thought a computer set the schedule - there's so much to keep track of and the travel time and geographical logistics.  It hurts my brain to think about setting up the schedule for 30 teams, 162 games...</UTT>Yeah that would be a ton to keep track of! Do you use a telephone by the way? I bet they definitely had to to schedule those games haha</UTT>I have an iPhone glued to my right hand at all times.  It's amazing how much computing power we have in smartphones compared to the mega computers of 3 decades ago....</UTT>Yeah I mostly just use my cell phone. I don't have a landline anymore, but it's crazy that there is a phone cable that goes from the United States to Europe, it stretches across the ocean and is about 3 inches thick</UTT>I would have thought, with wireless technology and satellites that they wouldn't need to run cables anywhere in the world today?</UTT>Yeah that is strange. I'd be scared that something would happen to the cable personally. Also, did you know that your iPhone actually has more computing power than the entire nuclear deterrent system in the United States? That is scary haha</UTT>I bet the iPhone has more computing power than a desktop that was running Windows XP!</UTT>LOL that's a good point! Well it was great talking to you and make sure to donate your unused cell phone minutes to UNICEF, they will give free clean water to a child for every minute you don't use your phone</UTT>1

Do you know much about the white house?</UTT>Yes, have you visited there? Bush put solar panels on.</UTT>I have visited it obviously from the outside. There are similar buildings in France and Ireland too</UTT>Yes, I think someone in America has built one similar also?</UTT>Oh did not know that, where is it? WHen Roosevelt was in the house he did not allow christmas trees there</UTT>Really, I think that was because he was a staunch conservationist!  Hard to believe they are still using floppy disks.They probably decorated the trees outside and everywhere else at that time.</UTT>Yeah I think the floppy discs are safer still for some reason. Did you know the white house got hit on November of 2011?</UTT>Makes sense. Yeah, its surprising it took four days to find that the bullets had hit the white house!  Do you enjoy traveling?</UTT>Right? Yes I love it. have you ever been to Japan?</UTT>No, have you? I hear its very crowded! The highways are tolls and it cost quiet abit to travel across the country!</UTT>Yes it can cost you as much as $300 to travel across, quite a bit</UTT>Did you know air travel is 10% slower than in the 60's in order to save fuel costs?</UTT>Oh cool. The Dutch are working on a bus that can actually go 160 mph</UTT>That would be interesting to ride! Iceland has no public toll service most people without cars use domestic flights. I reminds me of the Virgin Islands people fly from island to island.</UTT>Yeah it is a small country so the flights must be short too. In Mackinac Island they do not allow motorized vehicles</UTT>Oh really, Did you know during the age of discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide future food for other travelers. I love rabbits, so cute. But, I know they had to eat.</UTT>Yeah that is true. Do you know who was the first king to travel the world?</UTT>King Kalakaua of Hawaii!! That surprises me. I love Hawaii, when I was there at the big island we went to the volcanic area. Very cool all the lava rocks!</UTT>Nice, I would love to go someday. DO you use the internet much?</UTT>Yes, like most people too much! Seems like I'm on it all the time. I can believe that only 7% read the full terms when buying a service. My goodness its so long . I try to go over the basics!</UTT>Oh me too, they are super long. it would take forever. It was nice chatting with you</UTT>1

Do you like dance? I like watching the beautifully choreographed moves, but am not a good dancer myself.</UTT>I'm not too good of a dancer, but I try. I used to try to replicate Michael Jacksons moves, but that didn't go over too well for me.</UTT>Haha that is funny. And you didn't have his special patented device I assume.</UTT>I sure didn't that made me mad when I found out that's what he used. I busted my face so many times trying to do that.</UTT>Well at least you know now! Babies even spontaneously dance when they hear music!</UTT>I see that a lot. I work at a children's hospital. We have these new infant warmer/incubators in our NICU that you can hook your phone or MP3 player to. It's so cute seeing the babies move around and dance when the parents play music.</UTT>Oh wow that is cool technology to have in the NICU. Tupac was even a dancer and he did ballet in high school.</UTT>That's pretty interesting. I guess that was before he started getting involved with gangs.</UTT>Yes it must have been.</UTT>I agree with that. Haha! Bruce Lee was also a great dancer!</UTT>Yes he surprisingly was! Do you like wearing hats? Not in the NICU but in general! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler!</UTT>When I'm not at work I usually wear a baseball hat. I wish I could wear a top hat like British Politicians had to wear when they were making a point in the House of Commons.</UTT>Yes they actually did that up until 1998!</UTT>That's pretty funny. Did you know that 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins?</UTT>Interesting. I wonder if sufragettes using them as weapons was a big problem?</UTT>I think that was why. I'd hate to get stabbed with a hat pin.</UTT>That would not be fun! Knights actually used to raise their face visors as a show of friendliness and that is where the phrase "tipping ones hat" comes from.</UTT>That's pretty intersting. Do you know where the origins of the dunce cap came from?</UTT>Are those the hats that were worn at parties to encourage foolish behavior? Sounds like what alcohol does! Well it was fun chatting with you!</UTT>That's right, alcohol plus a dunce cap equals double dunce. Haha! It was nice chatting with you too.</UTT>Have a good one!</UTT>1

How are you today? Do you like watching television?</UTT>I do. I really like That 70s show but apparently the UK did not. They created the same show verbatim but it was cancelled after 10 episodes.</UTT>That's a great show. I'm surprised it flopped over there.</UTT>I agree. Some shows are really successful like Pokemon it has been on the air for over 16 years.</UTT>I heard there are over 750 Pokemon shows.</UTT>That's a lot of Pokemon. There are probably more Simpson episodes than Pokemon although there is one episode where Bart does not appear nor is he mentioned.</UTT>Tons of Pokemon. I'm surprised he only doesn't appear in one episode. I think that show has been running for 30 years now.</UTT>Yes and they do not seem to mind competition. When South Park aired a Family Guy related episode the produces received flowers from The Simpsons crew.</UTT>That's pretty awesome of them. Do you like horror films?</UTT>I do not. I would much rather watch Bambi, although Stephen King was terrified of that film and called it the first horror movie he saw.</UTT>That's hilarious he thought it was scary. I guess maybe when the fire is in the forest.</UTT>Yes, I suppose he burned more than 180 calories. That's the amount you can lose from watching a horror film.</UTT>That's a real good way to burn some extra calories. I'm guessing because your heart beats faster when you're scared.</UTT>It is said that if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will appreciate the art more.</UTT>That's interesting. Does it say why?</UTT>No explanation but something in our brain probably processes the information different from the stimuli. You know it is only a single fold in the brain the distinguishes between reality and fantasy.</UTT>That's very interesting. I saw that people play fantasy national spelling bee.</UTT>And I learned there is even a fantasy congress and you receive points based off legislative success. I would be terrible at that game.</UTT>That's funny. I've only played fantasy football and baseball. What about you?</UTT>I have not played in any fantasy league. I am more of a spectator just enjoying film and television. And even though I do not like horror, I did like the Shining. It was kind of nice to know the actor portraying Danny never knew he was acting in a horror film.</UTT>The Shining was a very good movie. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good weekend.</UTT>1

I'm guessing because your heart beats faster when you're scared.</UTT>That's a great show. I'm surprised it flopped over there.</UTT>Tons of Pokemon. I'm surprised he only doesn't appear in one episode. I think that show has been running for 30 years now.</UTT>That's a lot of Pokemon. There are probably more Simpson episodes than Pokemon although there is one episode where Bart does not appear nor is he mentioned.</UTT>The Shining was a very good movie. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good weekend.</UTT>you can still travel there and not wake up early</UTT>I do not. I would much rather watch Bambi, although Stephen King was terrified of that film and called it the first horror movie he saw.</UTT>That's hilarious he thought it was scary. I guess maybe when the fire is in the forest.</UTT>Yes, I suppose he burned more than 180 calories. That's the amount you can lose from watching a horror film.</UTT>That's very interesting. I saw that people play fantasy national spelling bee.</UTT>It is said that if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will appreciate the art more.</UTT>I have not played in any fantasy league. I am more of a spectator just enjoying film and television. And even though I do not like horror, I did like the Shining. It was kind of nice to know the actor portraying Danny never knew he was acting in a horror film.</UTT>No explanation but something in our brain probably processes the information different from the stimuli. You know it is only a single fold in the brain the distinguishes between reality and fantasy.</UTT>0
Hello there.  Do you want to talk about the government?</UTT>Good morning! I think I could talk about the Government and politics all day long!</UTT>Ok, well we know that a government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state. In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary.</UTT>Yes, it is. I find it funny that Wikileakes published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks.</UTT>Yes, I agree.  Did you know that the US government owns 86% of Nevada? Wow.</UTT>Wow! That is a lot of land. I think it is nice what the Norwegian Government did in 2008.</UTT>Yes, that the donated $1Billion to help save the Amazon Rainforest. That was generous of them.</UTT>Yes, I agree. It was very selfless. Have you heard about the man in France and his sale of the Eiffel Tower?</UTT>Yes, that he impersonated a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower not just once but twice.  Outrageous wasn't it?</UTT>Completely insane! So, I know our current President gets a lot of flack, but the first President of Zimbabwe was called President Banana! I wonder if that was a compliment or an insult?</UTT>Considering their main export, it might be a compliment.  Also the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while he was in office. Cool.</UTT>Yeah, maybe. And that is surprising about the albums!</UTT>Yes, and up until 1802 in the US, the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the Vice President. Too bad it's not still like that.</UTT>I don't think it would be a good idea to have Trump and Clinton together. They would not get a long at all.</UTT>Or maybe they would if they had to, just a thought.  Anyways, do you know anything about radio?  Radio is an interesting topic and there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.</UTT>I like the radio. I know Jupiter has storms so strong that they can be picked up an heard by an am radio.</UTT>Yes, and funny thing is that according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be Canadian.</UTT>I like that law. It seems like it keeps things fair.</UTT>Maybe a good thing.  Did you know that soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razor blade and pencil as the diode? I think they were called Foxhole radios.</UTT>No kidding! Sounds creative.</UTT>Yes, I'd like to try and make one myself. Nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

Do you play a musical instrument?</UTT>Not really, You ?</UTT>I don't really play music. I've heard that there is a song used for testing auto-pianos. It's too hard for human beings to play.</UTT>That what they said about Chopin's song... that only him could play and it was simply too difficult for anybody else :)</UTT>I wonder whether it's true that there is a piano on the top of Britain's highest mountain. That sounds hard to believe. Who put it up there, and why?</UTT>There is only one way to find out ;) when we're going ?</UTT>We can replace the piano with an aluminum one, like the one they used on the Hindenburg.</UTT>Why Aluminum ?</UTT>I guess that the lightest metal that cheap enough for building a piano. The piano was only 356 pounds. I wonder how much the piano at the top of the mountain in Britain weighs, and who tunes it.</UTT>I wonder if they transported that piano there in whole one piece or in smaller pieces and then assembled it ?</UTT>That's a good point. They could assemble it piece by piece. You'd have to have a piano expert climb up there as well. Maybe a helicopter? I wonder how high they can go.</UTT>I think the main question is... why... ;) lol :) why ! Who the hell wants to play piano after mountain climbing :) put a bar over there with warm wine ! :)</UTT>The piano is an old instrument, dating back to 1700. I think there must be some quirky fans out there. Why did they put the piano on top of the mountain? Because it was there.</UTT>What do You mean it was there ?</UTT>"Why did you climb Mt. Everest?" "Because it was there"</UTT>k...  Do You like Linking Park ?</UTT>Linkin Park? Are they a band?</UTT>yes, quite famous ! because their first album was so popular they played 324 concerts in 2001 alone :)</UTT>I can't imagine doing 324 in one year. They must have been pretty young to maintain that pace.</UTT>yes they were :) young and successful !</UTT>I bet they didn't tour that much in later years. It's quite grueling. The fans love it, but it's hard to have a normal life on the road.</UTT>I guess so, but who said famous musicians have normal life :)</UTT>That's true. I see that the Ramones did over 2000 concerts. 20 years of touring? That's tough. They would live in hotel rooms.</UTT>Wow... they probably didn't know any other life... it was one huge party ;)</UTT>I surprised they didn't just die from the constant stimulation.</UTT>I agree ;) all that booze and drugs after the concerts were probably not helping :) or were they... ? :) lol</UTT>I don't think they would remember the first 19.5 years of touring.</UTT>lol :) You're probably right !  Hey it was really nice chatting with You ! :)</UTT>Great chat!</UTT>1

Do you like horses?</UTT>I do like horses. Did you know that horses are ticklish?</UTT>No, I didn't know that. Like super ticklish?</UTT>Yes, along with sharks and  orangutans. How's that for a weird animal fact?</UTT>It is pretty weird. Did you know CLint Eastwood is allergic to horses?</UTT>No kidding! And he did movies that I can remember him being on horses. I wonder how he did it?</UTT>I'm not sure. Maybe he took claritin?</UTT>Haha. Maybe! Did you know that an individual horse has a peak horsepower of 14.9 horsepower.</UTT>I can see that. And did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed?</UTT>They do? I wonder what that's all about?</UTT>It is for speed walking, a tolt.</UTT>Oh, okay that makes perfect sense.</UTT>Do you use reddit?</UTT>I have in the past. I know the co-founder of reddit has a cat named Karma. I think that's cute.</UTT>Interesting. Did you know the first comments was a complaint?</UTT>Are you serious? Why am I not surprised by that? I know now there are posts organized by subject into user created subreddits.</UTT>Yeah, that is pretty funny. Only 0.53% of the people actually participate that visit.</UTT>Yeah, I could see that happening. I know it is ranked as the #3 most visited website in the US.</UTT>WOW! Really? I didn't know that. That is great. Nice chatting with you.</UTT>Yes, and its #6 ranked worldwide. I'll have to get back on. Have a good night! Nice chatting!</UTT>That is crazy. Well take it easy!</UTT>1

good morning to you</UTT>Goof morning.  Do you listen to Jazz?</UTT>Sometimes yea! Especially when im cooking dinner, it makes me feel classy. do you?</UTT>I do.  Apparently Clint Eastwood agrees with us.</UTT>wow, I never would have guessed he was so into music! I thought he would only like that old west cowboy whistle</UTT>I wonder if he ever attended the Jazz concerts by the Harlem woman for free organized.</UTT>maybe he did! Did you ever notice that so many jazz musicians have goatees?</UTT>I did, they said it provided comfort while playing.  I dont know if thats true.  As a musician myself I think facial hair would be distracting to play with.</UTT>maybe! i kept thinking about what would happen if the hair got in their way</UTT>I also dont remember some of the greats with goatees, Dizzy Gillespie, Louie Armstrong, both no facial hair</UTT>hmmm, maybe ive been bamboozled!!!</UTT>Its possible.  LOL.  How do you feel about rap?</UTT>i actually enjoy some of it! not the mumble stuff nowadays but something with a good melody and actual singing i tend to enjoy. do you?</UTT>I agree with you, I love the old school rap, but not some of today's stuff.</UTT>some modern stuff is good too. I like Kid Cudi and Kanye, and even Lil Peep (rip)</UTT>Tupac even has his music in the Library of Congress of Cultural significance.</UTT>I was surprised to hear that, but he had a huge impact on culture when he was alive. did you know Busta Rhymes voiced the Reptar wagon in the rugrats movie?</UTT>I didnt.  I didnt see it, but I loved Rugrats as a kid.</UTT>from what i remember, the wagon doesnt talk!</UTT>Reptar was the best.   Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist.</UTT>I can see that, a lot of rappers have really big artistic minds, sometimes just music isnt enough</UTT>1

Did you ever think about how celebrities in science are rarer than in music, film, sport, and politics?</UTT>No I never thought of that.  Were you a fan of Stephen Hawking?</UTT>I think that it was amazing how he was almost completely paralyzed and could accomplish so much.</UTT>Yes, I agree, he was brilliant as well.  He was the ultimate example of mind over matter.</UTT>He was one of the first people to apply quantum physics to black holes and make predictions  with a process named after him as "Hawking radiation"</UTT>Yeah his understanding and explaining of quantum physics and other matter is incredible.</UTT>I don't really understand what he understood because it seems so foreign to me, but he also had a lot of wit as well to share with the world.</UTT>Yeah I am the same, it is very complex stuff. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection like species do here.</UTT>Hawking was very active up until the end of life even travelling and lecturing internationally.  I have to give credit as well to his supporters</UTT>Yeah I agree with you there.  I guess there is a radical theory that there is only one electron in the universe! I'm sure Hawking would have disagreed.</UTT>Probably.  Also, there is a region of space maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.  There must be so much out there.</UTT>Wow, yeah it is wild to think about the universe as a whole in general.</UTT>Strange but there are some stars that are cold enough that they can be touched by a human hand</UTT>That is a strange fact, very cool.  Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics?</UTT>Not sure who that is, but I wonder if Hawkings would validate the tidbit that the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics?</UTT>I'm not sure that is an interesting thought and he is the leader of North Korea.</UTT>Oh wow!  Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrity voicings of animated film characters.</UTT>I didn't know that.  I guess Pixas spent 3 years studying the physics of curly hair in order to get merida's hair in brave right.</UTT>People don't realize how much time is spent on these details.  Judge Judy makes a heap of money at $123,000 per episode  being highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James</UTT>Holy cow that is so much an episode.  I wonder how much other tv people make.</UTT>I don't know, but I guess not as much.  Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street :)</UTT>1

Hello! How are you today?</UTT>Hello :) Good. Just working on HIITs and letting movies run in the background. You?</UTT>Just deciding what superhero move to watch on Netflix! Any recommendations?</UTT>Are you a Marvel or DC fan?</UTT>Marvel for sure! However, the dark knight trilogy is my favorite!</UTT>Kindred spirits! I'd suggest anything that will help you get ready for Endgame...which includes Spider-Man, Iron Man, Cpt America, Thor, Hulk, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and so on. Stan Lee is a genius...well...was a genius. His work is astounding.</UTT>It really was. I saw Captain Marvel this weekend so I'm pumped for Endgame! I didn't know Disney didn't own the rights to all the big marvel characters!</UTT>It's not exactly that they don't own them, they don't own the rights to show the big name characters in their theme parks that are east of the Mississippi river. Did you know both Marvel and DC own one character together?</UTT>Oh that makes sense! I didn't know that, who is the character?</UTT>The character is called 'Access' and his sole purpose is to try to keep both companies' universes separate.</UTT>Haha I guess that makes sense? Do you watch a lot of television?</UTT>Not really but the darn thing is always on in my house anyway. Kids. Husband. Background noise. Thank goodness for energy efficient television sets being readily available. What about you?</UTT>I agree! I do once in awhile, mainly the Simpsons actually!</UTT>Oh my, that's on A LOT. My husband loves the Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Bobs Burgers, Archer...I could go on lol. If you like the Simpsons, I bet you know some interesting stuff about it.</UTT>I do! There is only one episode of the simpsons where Bart isn't mentioned nor seen!</UTT>Whoa...I wonder which one. I do know a really amusing fact. Did you know...when South Park aired its Family Guy finale that the producers received flowers from the crew behind the Simpsons? That's hilarious.</UTT>I remember that episode quite well! Did you ever watch Pokemon?</UTT>I did. I watched a ton of it as a kid. There were well over 700 episodes of it. I wonder how many years that comes out to? I'm in my late 20s...it's gotta be over 15.</UTT>50 episodes over 16 years! I remember watching it as a kid too! Great chatting with you!</UTT>You too, have a good day!</UTT>Thanks!</UTT>1

Did you ever watch Full House?</UTT>Hello, I loved Full House growing up. What about you?</UTT>I did too. It seems to me ever since that show people have been obsessed with the Olsen Twins.</UTT>I agree. Did you know Pixar has a secret room that is used by celebrities?</UTT>That's pretty neat. I wonder if Judge Judy has ever been there. Did you know that she makes $123,000 per episode!?</UTT>She makes so much money it's crazy! Did you know Robin Williams was the voice of the Genie in Aladdin?</UTT>I did know that. He was the first to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.</UTT>That's pretty cool. Sad to have him go out the way he did. I always liked him.</UTT>Yeah, it was definitely heartbreaking. He seemed like such a good person and a kind soul.</UTT>I agree. Ethiopia has a celebrity chef that claims he can combat hunger by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods.</UTT>I hope he can do that. Do you know who the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street was?</UTT>I do not. Who was it?</UTT>It was Carol Burnett.</UTT>Interesting. I would have never guessed. Do you like Nintendo?</UTT>I used to play mine all the time. I actually bought one of the last systems when they discontinued them in Japan in 2003.</UTT>I loved mine too. It was the first system I grew up with.</UTT>It's funny that it could only display 54 colors, but it was so fun.</UTT>That is funny. Crazy how much technology has advanced since then.</UTT>Yeah it is crazy, I feel like systems now can display endless colors.</UTT>For sure. Did you know Bill Nye got his break by winning a Steve Martin look alike contest?</UTT>I've seen younger pictures of both of them, and I can totally see that now. I wonder if the rejection of a movie role for like having "that presidential look" inspired Ronald Reagan to run for president?</UTT>That's hilarious that happened. Well, it was great talking with you. Have a good day.</UTT>1

I wonder if the rejection of a movie role for like having "that presidential look" inspired Ronald Reagan to run for president?</UTT>I agree. Did you know Pixar has a secret room that is used by celebrities?</UTT>That is funny. Crazy how much technology has advanced since then.</UTT>Interesting. I would have never guessed. Do you like Nintendo?</UTT>Yeah it is crazy, I feel like systems now can display endless colors.</UTT>That's hilarious that happened. Well, it was great talking with you. Have a good day.</UTT>It was Carol Burnett.</UTT>I do not. Who was it?</UTT>Hello, I loved Full House growing up. What about you?</UTT>That's pretty neat. I wonder if Judge Judy has ever been there. Did you know that she makes $123,000 per episode!?</UTT>I did too. It seems to me ever since that show people have been obsessed with the Olsen Twins.</UTT>I agree. Ethiopia has a celebrity chef that claims he can combat hunger by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods.</UTT>I used to play mine all the time. I actually bought one of the last systems when they discontinued them in Japan in 2003.</UTT>That's pretty cool. Sad to have him go out the way he did. I always liked him.</UTT>Yeah, it was definitely heartbreaking. He seemed like such a good person and a kind soul.</UTT>I loved mine too. It was the first system I grew up with.</UTT>It's funny that it could only display 54 colors, but it was so fun.</UTT>I did know that. He was the first to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.</UTT>I agree, the cosmos is fascinating and earth is too, so many planets out there, all the wonders they hold</UTT>0
Are you a tennis fan by chance? Novak Djokovic sure is a great player.</UTT>Im not actually. I dont even know who he is.</UTT>He is a Serbian tennis player. It's tough to play tennis when the courts get wet but they want to use the helicopter to dry the grass after rain.</UTT>I heard they did that. Pretty genius if you ask me.</UTT>Yeah I agree. If you can believe it the longest match lasted 11 hours!</UTT>Yeah I believe it was played over the course of a few days.</UTT>That is amazing. A black man won the first U.S. Open title in 1968 and no black man has won it since.</UTT>Some people get kicked out for grunting too much. Some circles consider that cheating.</UTT>Yeah I think some people who think that is cheating are a bit ridiculous. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis. I didn't know that.</UTT>Did you ever play table tennis.</UTT>Yeah I really like that game. But I wouldn't want to play Gail Monfils.</UTT>I sure wouldn't either. I used to think it was called ping pong. How silly of me.</UTT>I don't think it is silly I definitely caught that as well. It's a fun form of entertainment. But I also like playing Nintendo. The original Nintendo entertainment system can only display 54 colors.</UTT>I love nintendo. I think super nintendo was better though.</UTT>Yeah maybe it was. I love playing donkey Kong. Around 50 BC they bred chickens for entertainment lol.</UTT>Thats cool. I think we have better stuff to do these days. Dont you.</UTT>Yeah for sure. I don't want to be playing with no chickens. I like watching movies. I never knew Ronald Reagan was an actor. Can't believe he got rejected from a role because he didn't look presidential.</UTT>Yeah I think he was in a few things before he became president.</UTT>I would like to see those movies. They should have them on Netflix. The original Nintendo entertainment system was finally discontinued in September 2003 in Japan. It had a great run.</UTT>It did have a great run. i know I bought a few of them over the years. Have a good one.</UTT>1

Do you have a favorite television show you like watching?</UTT>Hi there, yes I do, I love the SImpsons among other shows. How about you?</UTT>I was a fan of the 70s show and days like these, but don't understand why it was cancelled after only ten episodes, was it because of the cast?</UTT>Not sure as to what the reason was there really. Maybe because in te UK humour is different. Do you ever watch SNL?</UTT>It probably is, I think the 70s show remade did ok in the UK. Yes, my favorite is the weekend update, it's hilarious! Are you a fan?</UTT>Yeah me too. I guess it is the longest running skit they have in the SNL</UTT>I could see why, it's witty, entertaining, and hilarious! I forget which of the Baldwin brothers does the Trump impersonation, but Alec Baldwin also narrated Thomas the Tank engine for at least 52 episodes! What a drastic change!</UTT>It is the same guy, Alec. He is so good at it too. That is a huge change for sure. DO you ever watch the Simpsons?</UTT>Oh so it is him! I used to watch it occasionally and I know it's wildly popular and successful but I never noticed the episode where Bart wasn't present, do you watch the Simpsons?</UTT>I do and I am not sure which episode that is. He wasn't even mentioned at least .</UTT>Yeah, I also didn't realize Pokemon was on for that long, there's at least 750 episodes! I thought Pokemon was something that was popular decades ago, but apparently not!</UTT>I think they have made a comeback with Pokemon Go and yeah they have been on air for 16 years. That is amazing</UTT>Oh yeah, that was very popular when it first came out, is it still that popular? I've only heard about it on the radio and never played, do you?</UTT>I have not played it either but I know it is all over. Back to hobbies, do you enjoy hockey?</UTT>I have never played hockey even though it snows a lot! Is hockey quite as big as it is in Canada where it's their national sport?</UTT>Yeah I think up there it is really popular. Did you hear the US Olympic team lost to an England high school team?</UTT>High schoolers losing to an Olympic team? Wow, that's kind of embarrassing, unless they let them win. there was a hockey player being traded for only $1 and he went on to win four stanley cups!</UTT>I guess that trade did not stop him from being a great player after all. Slovakian WOmen's team seems to be amazing to score a goal every 44 seconds</UTT>That's impressive, is there a difference between hockey and ice hockey as some countries refer?</UTT>I think they are the same thing. I know there is field hockey that does not involve ice, but those two should be the same thing</UTT>Oh ok, I think both sound really painful, especially when it's played on ice, an average professional player even loses up to eight pounds in one game!</UTT>1

hi, do you enjoy reading?</UTT>I used to read a lot in high school, I heard Starship Troopers was a good sci-fi novel, it is on the reading lists of the US military</UTT>that is pretty cool. there is a woman who hold the record for speed reading</UTT>yeah Anne Jones, she can read 4,700 a minute, I wonder how long it would take her to read the bible</UTT>Pretty fast I bet. do you know who tolkien and cs lewis are?</UTT>I think he wrote Game of thrones or The Lord of The rings, not sure all I know is they like laughing at bad poetry</UTT>ahaha yeah they had those contests which one will laugh first</UTT>Doesn't sound too much fun to me, neither does reading Ender's Game which is suggested reading in the US Marine Corps</UTT>yeah not sure why they recommend that. do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Yea sometimes, I'd really like to see if I can pick up Jupiter's radio waves, I wonder what am frequencies they can be heard on</UTT>yeah that is so cool. have you listened to a canadian radio ever?</UTT>No I don't think I've heard any Canadian radio stations</UTT>Well, they play 40% canadian music, it is the law</UTT>I've never hear much of canadian music, I don't know if I enjoy listening to it being played a lot on the radio</UTT>Yeah that is a lot of Justin Bieber for sure</UTT>I don't know what's worse, Justing Biber or listening to nuntii latina in Finland</UTT>Yeah I do not speak latin so for me it would be boring but it is interesting that they give the news in latin there</UTT>I wonder if there is any latin rappers, I heard Korea has compliment battle rappers</UTT>yeah I would like to listen to those really. do you like eminem?</UTT>Yea he has some good songs, I heard he's a huge spiderman fan</UTT>yeah I heard that too. nice chatting with you</UTT>1

I guess Stephen King considers that to be a horror movie!</UTT>I didnt, its weird considering King is one of the most renowned horror authors, I guess we all have our fears</UTT>haha ya maybe hes afraid of deer? I need to watch more horror movies you can burn almost 200 calories when watching one</UTT>Yeah lol, maybe he is and thats a great thing  I might pick the habit of watching horror films daily just to lose weight and get fit</UTT>haha you should come out with a weight loss book and that is teh secret!

Hello! Do you enjoy mountain biking? Would you ever consider riding under power lines?</UTT>At times, your near power lines.  It is unavoidable in modern life.  I would not stay under them for a long time. A bike trail under them would not appeal to me.</UTT>Yeah it seems a bit crazy to me. In Maryland, they have created a six mile trail that follows the power lines.</UTT>Now, if this Dagnija Kreslins is supper annoying about people peeping in her windows, I might just go.  Six miles under a line... some times in the rain you can here them buzz.</UTT>Yeah that would be concerning. Do you enjoy running? Runners are going to use the trail because the dirt path is easier on their knees. I love running!</UTT>Not a runner.  It some times gets annoying to mix use a single track.  Cooperation with utilities seems a good idea.  Way to go Gretchen Bolton.  Nice T shirt.</UTT>What is your favorite mode of travel? The Dutch are currently creating a commuter bus that will travel at 160 mph...</UTT>Not sure I want to go 160 mph in a yellow bus and a cranky Dutch man at the wheel.  My favorite mode is motorcycle, no luggage, no plans, back at work in one week.</UTT>That does sound nice! I agree though, 160 mph is too fast. I prefer cars. In Iceland, there is no public rail system and people often fly between cities. I'm not a fan of flight.</UTT>I dont understand Japan.  That is easy to say.  $300 to travel across the country.  Seems like a lot.  Maybe flying is safer.</UTT>Yeah that's too expensive! I also enjoy walking, since it helps me get around and doesn't cost a thing. Did you know that putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes can remove odors?</UTT>I did know that.  Coffee grounds used or fresh works well too.  If you are walking along a ridge line, you are easy to see.  Walk about 3/4 from the bottom.  much stealthier.</UTT>Interesting! That is good information to know. I prefer to wear tennis shoes, because they are comfortable and I could take them on the Montgomery County trail.</UTT>Ever have a pair of shoes that you can not stand.  Just something wrong with them.  Turns out, 5000 year old shoes perform better in some respects than modern shoes.</UTT>I have. I wonder what makes those old shoes better. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week. That would be pricey!</UTT>I have never wanted to wear ballet shoes.  It looks painful.  One look at their feet and you will know.  People do odd things for fashion.  maybe modern shoes are too fashionable.</UTT>I'd agree with that. Fashion shoes are also too expensive. Some high fashion shoes can sell for thousands of dollars a pair.</UTT>$15 per pair sounds about right.  Way to go Stephon Marbury.</UTT>Yep that is the perfect amount to spend on shoes! I also think I could live in Hawaii, because the office business attire is the aloha shirt.</UTT>In Jamaica, it is a dress shirt and dress shorts.  with black socks and dress shoes. I have seen the layered look with popped collars before. Funny guys.</UTT>Wow that's quite the look! Well it was good talking to you. Enjoy your travels, however you chose to get there.</UTT>Hope your better than traveling with Billy Mays. Pallbearers with blue shirts and khaki pants.</UTT>That's an odd look</UTT>1

Hello, do you follow tennis?</UTT>Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball.</UTT>Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis?</UTT>I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene "the crocodile" lacoste who was a famous player.</UTT>Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since.</UTT>Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open.</UTT>I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.</UTT>Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days. I bet they were exhausted!</UTT>That's crazy long!</UTT>I agree! It's amazing the facts you can find on Google. Did you know that a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon?</UTT>That's pretty amazing! I saw that Google maps calculates traffic by how fast Android devices are moving on the road.</UTT>I never knew that! I wonder whose? I know I heard that back in the day Google used goats to keep the lawn under control instead of hiring people to mow.</UTT>That's hilarious! Google went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the web traffic with it.</UTT>I can imagine. I use it a lot. It's hard to believe its only been around since 1998.</UTT>I agree. When there is a dispute on a border, Google maps tailors the map to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located.</UTT>That sounds logical. I wish I would have gotten on board with the 2004 initial public offering to buy stock. I can't even imagine the outcome.</UTT>I can't either. Do you like shoes?</UTT>I love shoes!! I know that shoes made 5000 years ago perform better than today's shoes!</UTT>That's pretty amazing they perform better than the shoes of today!</UTT>I agree. I can't see how though. I find it amazing the array of choices like ones that can cost thousands of dollars a pair.</UTT>It was good chatting with you!</UTT>1

Hi, how are you?</UTT>I love to watch some good comedies on television.  Do you?</UTT>I do. What is your favorite comedy?</UTT>Friends and seinfeld were some of my favorites on NBC.</UTT>Those were good ones. I feel like Seinfeld holds up well but Friends, not so much... Did you watch the office?</UTT>I never watched the office but I did like Parks and Recreation.</UTT>I love that show too! It was so well written. So funny. I can lose a whole day watching that show.</UTT>Yes.  NBC seems to have a lot more dramas now like Chicago rather than comedies.</UTT>I do not think they can compete with Netflix's comedies or movies so they had to go dramas.</UTT>Yes they have Will and Grace on Thursdays but not much else</UTT>Is the reboot as good as the original? I really liked the original but havent seen the reboot.</UTT>I have not seen the reboot either but it got adopted for a new season.  NBC did have a bunch of failed comedy shows compared to the other networks.</UTT>They just picked up Brooklyn 99 so that's a new comedy they got! What other ones?</UTT>They have a backyard bar comedy called Abbys which is also new.</UTT>Really? Have you seen it or is it just a pilot at this point?</UTT>I have not seen it but it was picked up at midseason,</UTT>I will have to check it out. I had not heard of it. Do you watch shows like the voice?</UTT>I sometimes watch shows like the voice - they can definitely be interesting.  The Olympics definitely helped NBC get some good ratings as well.</UTT>I have only seen the voice like once. My wife watches it so I will get some of it but I dont watch those types of shows. I do love the olympics though!</UTT>Yes.  I do prefer comedy - I love bromantic comedies like Harold and Kumar and the hangover.</UTT>The first hangover was brilliant but the next two.. woah!</UTT>Yes.  And I agree with Bill Murray that the Kung Fu hustle was amazing in comedy!</UTT>I was shocked to learn that Jim Carrey no longer does dramas. He is talented but I feel he is a little off...</UTT>Yes he wants to do positive movies</UTT>1

Hello - how are you today?</UTT>I'm good!  Do you like to watch comedies?</UTT>I love comedy. Do you like them?</UTT>I'm a big fan!  Probably my favorite type of movie above the other genres.  Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since it's creation in 1989.  That's alot.</UTT>That's a ton! I saw that Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in comedy.</UTT>Hmmm...it must be funny then.  I've never seen it.  Have you?</UTT>I have not seen it yet either. I saw the Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy.</UTT>Yes.  I didn't know that.  It was also going to star Jack Black.  Did you remember 3rd Rock from the Sun?</UTT>I do remember 3rd Rock from the Sun. I didn't get to watch it too much though.</UTT>It was a funny show.  Corny comedy, but still good for a laugh.  It won a golden globe in 1997 for best comedy series.  Time sure is flying by.  Feels like that was yesterday.</UTT>That's interesting and definitely time flies by.</UTT>Did you ever see the movie Incredibles 2?</UTT>I have not yet. What about you?</UTT>I did.  I can't believe it's been 15 years already since the first one came out in 2004.</UTT>That's pretty crazy. I saw the movie is actually set in the 1960s.</UTT>I didn't know that.  How interesting!  The girl who designs the superhero costumes in the movie Edna is voiced by the director of the film Brad Bird.</UTT>That's very cool that it was the voice of Brad Bird.</UTT>I agree.  The girl who voices the character of Violet is Sarah Vowell.  She is also a political commentator and best selling author of historical nonfiction.  That's pretty neat!</UTT>That's really neat. I'll have to try and catch that movie soon. Sounds like it's pretty good.</UTT>It's a fun watch.  Especially if you like comedies.  I think anything Pixar has done is pretty good.</UTT>It was great talking to you!</UTT>1

do you know much about presidents?</UTT>I know some stuff. Do you know who the wealthiest three in the US are?</UTT>Yes that is JFK, Washington and Jefferson.</UTT>Yes. Do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?</UTT>Yes he was called president Banana</UTT>Yeah. I wonder if that means something else in their language too</UTT>I wonder too. Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?</UTT>I guess they get a lot of people there and need the room</UTT>Yeah I guess. Do you know how the VP used to be elected?</UTT>Yes that was the runner up that moved into that position</UTT>Yeah. Did you know the president of Indonesia is a pop star?</UTT>Yes and he has released three albums so far</UTT>Yesh what a guy. Do you like Nintendo?</UTT>I love it, too bad it was discontinued in 2003</UTT>Yes, it only had 54 colors but it was a lot of fun</UTT>Yeah I agree. Do you know who Bill Nye is?</UTT>Yes the science guy. You know how he got into entertainment?</UTT>Yes he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest</UTT>Yeah. Even Reagan once tried his hand at acting but did not go very well</UTT>Yes they said that he did not have the presidential look for the film</UTT>I guess he had the look to be a real president so that is okay with him I assume. Nice chat</UTT>1

do you believe in climate change</UTT>I believe the climate is changing but not sure it's man-made.  Although Michael Mann from Penn State said Summer 2018 had extreme weather.  Not sure from what, though.  Do yoU?</UTT>I believe that it is man made</UTT>what causes you to think that?  there are so many different key diagnostic tools, even an earth 'x-ray' that shows climate change but not WHY it's changing.</UTT>The sea level is increasing and the ice keeps melting in the 2 poles of the earth</UTT>well ice melted during the ice age and there were no cars or smog or even the industrial age</UTT>I see.  But we did not exactly see what caused the melting, could be other earth's disasters that we did not know about</UTT>that's very true. scientists are really trying to develop more tools - sort of like MRI waves but for the earth.  I think that will help with this debate as to what's causing it</UTT>I think so.  Do you know that more than 80 % of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed</UTT>I didn't know that. How sad is that.  Is it from climate change? or those wildfires and such?</UTT>From human activities.  It is so sad</UTT>wow I had no idea. I know they blame heat, drought, wildfires, flooding and stores (hurricanes) all on climate change.</UTT>Also, do you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long</UTT>I've never heard that before?  Why is it 24 hours now?  Can't be because of sun / night, right?   I know the earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun</UTT>I am not so sure, may be due to change in the earth's rotation in relative to the Sun and the Moon</UTT>that's interesting.  Did you know you could fit all the planets in between the earth and the moon and still have room left over?!</UTT>Never heard of that.  It is such a vast space</UTT>and the majority of Earth's polar regions are still covered in ice - wonder how climate change will affect the Antarctic and Arctic in the near future?</UTT>The areas of these regions will disappear drastically</UTT>that's sad.  do you really think so? I wish we could ensure that won't happen.</UTT>Yeah, people have been doing that.  Also, do you know that the earth will be free of helium by the end of the 21st century</UTT>no - is that also because of climate change? how will everything adapt to that?!</UTT>I have no idea.  I am wondering where will helium go?</UTT>this has been so interesting.  I hope we can still try to enjoy our Christmas, even with all this doom and gloom!  Thanks for talking with me!</UTT>nice chatting with you</UTT>Have a Merry Christmas - you've given me great conversation starters!</UTT>1

Hi.  Can you play the piano?</UTT>I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room.</UTT>Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio?</UTT>That's really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930.</UTT>I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that.</UTT>Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days.</UTT>I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays</UTT>Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day!</UTT>That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.</UTT>I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built.</UTT>That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time.</UTT>So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them.</UTT>I dont think I could own one, but Im not scared or anything.  Did you know there are No Snakes in New Zealand.</UTT>Yeah that's pretty crazy. The only bad thing about owning a snake is the upkeep, it can get expensive.</UTT>I bet, is your snake one of the ones that flies?</UTT>Haha no, king snakes can not do that, if they could I am not sure I would want to own one, they sound very dangerous.</UTT>Where I live a giant cobra escaped and was loose in the city.</UTT>Well I hope someone caught it before someone killed it, You cant punish them for doing what is hard wired into them.</UTT>They never found it.  Dead or alive.  Yeah, I have a friend who is seriously afraid of snakes, runs away from the smallest ones.</UTT>I don't have a fear of snakes, but spiders on the other hand I almost can not stand them to even be near me, hate the little buggers.</UTT>Small ones dont bother me but once they get past a certain size thats a big nope from me.  Roaches freak me out.</UTT>Haha yeah roaches are just down right nasty, any way good chatting with you.</UTT>Same here have a good day!</UTT>1

Looks like it is not meeting it's potential as an educational tool</UTT>I dont think I could own one, but Im not scared or anything.

I used to dance back in the day. I love it. Did you know babies dance spontaneous when they hear music?</UTT>It's a natural reaction.  All cultures have dance.</UTT>I heard that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?  Seriously, he won the hong kong cha-cha challenge. Who do you think is a great dancer?</UTT>Dance and formal martial arts have a lot in common, so it doesn't surprise me that Bruce Lee was a good dancer.</UTT>Tupac danced ballet! I can't even imagine!</UTT>You asked who I think is a good dancer.  There is Michael Jackson, who even patented a device to help with his dance moves.</UTT>Yes, love me some MJ. I have a friend's daughter that does ballet. They say a pro ballet dance can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. I thought they had to work them in.</UTT>Ballet uses choreography, which is one way dance can be characterized.</UTT>So did you watch the super bowl or have any fantasy drafts? Did you know that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee?</UTT>There is a fantasy Congress, too.  Seems like there are fantasy leagues for everything.</UTT>Yep. Crazy. I want to be a part of the Fantasy Congress!</UTT>It turns out that that a single fold in your brain separates perception of fantasy vs. reality.</UTT>Can't believe that! Do you like science and the solar system?</UTT>Very much.  Something most people don't know is that the sun is white, and is perceived as yellow because of the atmosphere</UTT>and it is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star. Space amazes me.</UTT>If we could harness all the sun's energy, we would have enough in one second to meet the needs of the earth for 500,000 years.</UTT>Yep. Speaking of energy, my friend's mom got hit by lightning and died. Did you know a bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun. 5x as hot</UTT>I don't doubt that lightning is very hot.  It sets many things on fire where it hits.</UTT>It is really powerful.I hate lightening but the sun provides so much. It provides energy in one second that will meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years</UTT>The sun accounts for well over 99% of solar system mass and it's burning full tilt, so it's not surprising that it is creating that much energy.</UTT>good talking to you.</UTT>Time to see what sun is left for today.</UTT>1

Have you watched Sesame Street?</UTT>I used to when my kids were young.  I liked Oscar the Grouch.  He seemed realistic.</UTT>He was one of my favorite character as well, why is he green though? ive always wondered that</UTT>Don't know.  He was once orange though.  I didn't realize Jim Henson created Sesame Street.  I knew he did muppets.</UTT>Did you ever follow Caroll Spinney?</UTT>Until now, I'd never heard of him.  I guess he created Oscar with a heart so he can't be all bad.</UTT>Well Caroll spiney was Big Bird and also Oscar the Grouch, he announced his retirement I think thats kind of sad, I grew up watching the show</UTT>That is sad.  In Turkey Oscar is called Kirpik and he lives in a basket.</UTT>Thats odd lol, do you watch a lot of tv?</UTT>About average I guess.  I liked the Simpsons.  Only one of their many episode didn't have Bart or no mention of him.</UTT>I didnt catch that episode, Bart is my favorite character though</UTT>Mine's Homer... Did you know the Dodo bird is in the pigeon family?  Imagine the mess around a park bench...</UTT>Isnt the Dodo bird extinct now? and it would be messy I agree</UTT>Yes.  Some birds bones weigh less than their feathers.</UTT>Wow they do, I guess that why they can fly, some birds fly really long distances without sleeping</UTT>Birds in Australia can mimic the sounds of chainsaws and car alarms.</UTT>I think they have serious identity issues lol, that would be fun to listen at</UTT>Did you know it's legal in S. Africa to have a flame-thrower on your car?</UTT>No I didnt know that,  why would they allow a thing like that? thank God they arent legal in America</UTT>To prevent carjacking.  I prefer McDonald's where the drive thru was invented to help soldiers.</UTT>That seems excessive, and McDonalds had a great idea, I bet that lifted sales and now every fast food chain has it</UTT>Yep.  Thanks for the chat!</UTT>1

do you like taylor swift?</UTT>Somewhat. Did you know she owns a private jet?</UTT>Yes it cost about $40 million and it is at Nashville airport</UTT>Yes and it has its own private hanger at it</UTT>Yeah. Did you know she accidentally released 8 seconds of her white noise song?</UTT>Yes and that made it to the top charts in Canada</UTT>Yeah that is crazy.

Earth is predicted to be helium free by the end of the century</UTT>Yeah I guess no more fun balloons and funny voices for us</UTT>I guess not.

Did you hear that Mark E Smith, of the band of the Fall died at age 60?</UTT>Oh thats too bad, I used to love his music, he sure was a visionary leader.</UTT>He was a punk rocker?  What other similar musicians do you like?</UTT>I like Eddie Van Halen, I think he has some sweet solos, like the one of the song Beat It, what about you?</UTT>I don't know my rock categories very well.  I like Queen and Aerosmith.  The Fall had over 60 different members during their 40 year existence.</UTT>Do you like the song "Repetition" its one of my favorites of the Fallen and also one of their earliest songs.</UTT>Yes.  That may be the only one I know.  The band was considered the pinnacle of underground rock.  That is like being on top of an anthill.</UTT>What I liked about the group is that they had like this classical touch kind of like the Beatles.</UTT>That is true for a select group of fans.  There are lots of albums available today.</UTT>Do you know how many albums the group has?</UTT>I believe it is 65.  There were many Facebook posts following his death and many different songs were cited as favorites.</UTT>Oh a lot of albums them I might search for a couple on Spotify, and do you have a Facebook account?</UTT>Yes.  My wife has more friends that me however.  I know that the color blue is used a lot on Facebook because Zuckerberg is red-green color blind.</UTT>Oh I thought it was because blue looks cool or because it attracts people, thats inresting to know though, cool fact!!</UTT>Yes.

You mentioned Van Halen earlier.  Did you know that he set the studio speakers on fire when recording his guitar solo for "Beat It"?</UTT>I didnt know that Ive always liked that solo but didnt know his guitar got on fire!! thats crazy!</UTT>Not the guitar, the speakers.  I am sure the power at volume created the heat.  I am going to go now.  Enjoyed talking with you!</UTT>1

How often do you use your phone?</UTT>I have an iPhone that I use all of the time. Did you know that women are more likely than men to have iPhones?</UTT>I did not. Do you have any idea why?</UTT>I do not. I don't even have a guess honestly. I know that the front man of Muse used his iPhone to record his unborn child's heartbeat and then used it in a song. That's pretty interesting.</UTT>Wow, he must have a very unique way of viewing the world as an artist. Did you know that when microsoft launched its own line of phones, they held a funeral for the death of the iphone? Lol</UTT>Wow, that was presumptuous. Both companies can do strange things. Jobs had to switch phones secretly during a presentation because they would run out of ram and crash.</UTT>Another funny fact is there is actually a iphone game called send me to heaven that creators developed to encourage people to shatter as many iphones as possible by seeing how high they can toss their phone into the air. It was banned by apple since it encouraged behavior that would damage the user's devices</UTT>Wow, I can't imagine why people would have used the app. Some common sense should be used. There are plenty of other apps to choose from. As of January 2017 there were 2.2 million apps on the app store.</UTT>Not to mentioned that iPhone is like a small laptop and camera all in one device that can fit in your hand to take photos, play music, send and receive emails, and browse the web</UTT>They are pretty amazing. Do you like horror films? I love them.</UTT>I do love horror</UTT>Yay! The boy who played Danny in The Shining did not know they were filming a horror movie. That's probably good given how intense that movie is.</UTT>I guess that would allow him to show genuine reactions that were captured perfectly on film. I think horror films are interesting since it has very interesting visuals and watching it can help burn 180 plus calories.</UTT>I had heard that it burned calories. How fascinating. Do you enjoy Stephen King?</UTT>I personally haven't watch him much. But I have seen many reference in pop culture to him such in Gravity falls. I also read that the first horror film he saw was bambi.</UTT>That is correct. It terrified him as a child and as a result we have many great works.</UTT>I mean horror in general were inspired by many brilliant minds like Edgar Allan Poe or Mary Shelley. Do you prefer horror in a realistic slice of life setting or a more supernatural, fantasy setting?</UTT>I really enjoy both but I probably lean a little more towards realistic. And I really enjoy Poe and Shelley's Frankenstein. Did you know that if you watch a horror movie before looking at abstract art you will appreciate it more?</UTT>I wonder why. Did you know Frankenstein isn't the name of the monster, but actually the mad scientist?</UTT>I did indeed. Such a good book. Have you ever heard of a waterphone?</UTT>I recently read they are the instrument that makes those creepy sound signature to horror flicks. I mean it is amazing there are instruments that I never knew existed but are so prevalent in daily life.</UTT>That is correct.</UTT>1

Did you ever manage to catch Jupiter's storms on am?</UTT>No that is crazy that sounds can be heard from that far. I wonder if sound can do more than people think like change our moods and thoughts. I wonder if the Jupiter storm could effect us.</UTT>Hmmm good point. Do you listen to Canadian radio?</UTT>No Since I am in america but I have heard that in Canada 40 percent of the music must be from canadian artists. I love the rap music they play on the radio. Have you ever heard of Tupac?</UTT>Yes , his music is in the library of congress, that is how important the guy was</UTT>Rap music has come a long way since just being poetry. It is even big in korea where they made a new kind of rap called freestyle battle. Do you still buy CDs or albums?</UTT>I buy them from time to time, the digital versions. How about you? Do you have a favorite one?</UTT>I am a big fan of rock music like Linkin Park. I think their cd called Hybrid theory is the best selling cd of the 21st century. Have you ever used cassettes?</UTT>I have actually and I love that album, they are so great</UTT>It is amazing how people love music. I heard that two 100 year old twins made a rap cd in Japan. Do you like rap more than rock?</UTT>Hmm not not really I still like rock better/ Have you heard of Reel Big Fish?</UTT>I have heard a greatest hits album by them and I thought it was good. I like old school rap better than todays rap, Have you ever heard NWA?</UTT>Yeah they had the first album to reach platinum without advertising it</UTT>Yea I think its cause they were unique and actually had some rapping skill. Have you ever heard of eminem? I think he is the best rapper</UTT>I like him too. Did you know he originally wanted to be a comic book artist?</UTT>Yea I heard he was a big fan of Spider man, Kinda weird cause his music is not so friendly. I remember some radio stations did not want to play his music.</UTT>Yeah, go figure. Do you know Busta Rhymes?</UTT>Yea he is that rapper that is known for rapping really fast. I heard he even was on the kids shows rugrats as a voice. I think we should promote happy and positive rap music</UTT>I totally agree with that because I believe that way it can also be educational. Nice chatting with you :)</UTT>1

Did you see it?</UTT>Maybe a mental horror films,  I can definitely see how being lost in your own mind or dreams can be scary.  By the way that was an amazing movie!</UTT>Yes an amazing movie. Have you ever seen phineas and ferb?</UTT>No i havent.  What is that?</UTT>Well apparently the writer of the old Rocky Horror Show pictures is the voice of the dad on that show.</UTT>Ok,  thats cool.

You know the first international Olympic game was held in the year 1896.</UTT>Oh I am not convincing you to watch horror movies.  I just recently read some interesting facts that I thought were cool,  just thought I would share.  No,  I didnt know that about the olympics.  did you know the kid from the shining didnt even know they were shooting a horror film lol</UTT>I heard that he didn't find out until years later, that's wow. Yeah but back then the most successful competitors were, Germany's carl schuhmann, he won 4 golds.</UTT>Oh,  in what?</UTT>Gymnastics and Wrestling, I think he also competed in Weightlifting, the long jump and shot put.</UTT>That is interesting.  Do you like Gymnastics and wrestling?</UTT>I like them both maybe gymnastics a little more. Apparently the ancient Greeks practiced in order for war. Can imagine war being averted because of a wrestling match.</UTT>I thought they practiced to prepare themselves for war.  What do you mean a wrestling match?  I read recently that an american with a wooden leg won 6 medals in gymnastics.</UTT>Wow that's amazing!! I was just trying to be funny about the wrestling match to end the war. You know part of gymnastics included skills for mounting a horse and dismounting.</UTT>Oh ok lol I guess I just didnt get it. Yeah that seems hard.  Have you ever tried?</UTT>Wrestling or mounting horses? I've done a little of both.</UTT>The gymnastics mounting and dismounting.  Its been great talking to you,  have a good one.</UTT>1

every us president with a beard has been a republican, that's odd.</UTT>That is odd. So what do you think of trump.</UTT>I like trump</UTT>Me too. I think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude.</UTT>yeah I never liked trump before he was president. I think he's doing a great job with all that he's been dealt.</UTT>Trump is a republican. Did you know there hasnt been a president who wasnt a republican or democrat since 1853</UTT>You think it's true that the last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928? How can that be?</UTT>It doesnt sound right to me either.</UTT>funny about harry truman not wanting to be photo'd on the dumbo ride because he didn't want to be associated with repubs.</UTT>They was taking shots at each other even back then huh.</UTT>yeah looks like it. Some things never change.</UTT>consistent use of red and blue for the parties only started in 2000.</UTT>yeah looking at the red blue map, looks like most blue is on the coasts and the red is in the middle.</UTT>Yeah. I wonder why that is.</UTT>seems like the bigger cities are more blue.</UTT>I guess that makes a little bit of sense.</UTT>86% of nevada owned by the government?</UTT>i believe it. Nevada is mostly desert, so who else would want it.</UTT>true! who would want it? guess it's good for nuclear testing. ;)</UTT>Well if thats what they are doing out there Im guessing wikileaks will let us know.</UTT>yeah, maybe wikileaks can let us know about space aliens in area 51 too.</UTT>Well they published the governments plans to destroy wikileaks so Im sure they would have no problem leaking it. Lol.</UTT>heard assange was offered an australian passport, I always thought he was european</UTT>Yeah I did too. Well its been a good chat. I gotta get off here.</UTT>1

I love pop music is makes me want to dance, How about you?</UTT>Hello there, I do like pop music, but not all songs.</UTT>I am a big fan of all music, I love driving my car and blasting music out my radio.

Have you ever seen a Model T?</UTT>That is really cool, I didn't know that.  Yeah I have, Ford right?</UTT>Yes it was made by ford in 1908, I think in 1886 the Benz motorwagen was invented.

I wonder if that is true?</UTT>Yeah I have read that before, you can supposedly hear large storms from Jupiter on an am radio.</UTT>Its crazy what you can pick up with sound wave and how simple it can be done. In wwii soldiers made radios with razorblades and pencils</UTT>That is true, and that is so amazing they were able to do that, I'm sure any little bit of entertainment helped.</UTT>People are very easily entertained, especially with music. Music is loved by the whole world, Did you know that the President of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?</UTT>I have read that before, I wonder how bad or good they are.  I do bet they have sold really well though.</UTT>Music always does well, In North Korea there is a girl band that is really popular. I think pop music is accepted in most places. Do you like girl bands?</UTT>Yeah I like some girl bands, but they are mostly really old music.  How about you?</UTT>I like rock music more but I do like the fact that United states created pop in the 1950s</UTT>Yeah that is a cool fact, I like a lot of the music from the 50's from the US.</UTT>I have never heard music that old but I do like Ricky Gervais pop music from the 80s</UTT>That is interesting stuff for sure, well it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night.</UTT>You also have a good night and cherish your pop music and car radios</UTT>Thanks you too.</UTT>1

My kids love musicals, Have you seen any good ones?</UTT>Yeah that is a cool fact, I like a lot of the music from the 50's from the US.</UTT>It my favorite car, Did you know that the brand was named after a french explorer who founded Detroit. Have you ever seen a Model T?</UTT>Yes from the movie Jaws. How frightful would it be to see something that big swimming toward you?</UTT>I remember one time we were at the drive ins and we heard a weird noise coming from the radio, My sister said that she heard you can hear Jupiter from your radio. I wonder if that is true?</UTT>Thanks you too.</UTT>0
HI how are you?</UTT>Im great, do you like fiction?</UTT>I do for the most part. What about you?</UTT>I like it, George RR Martin is one of my favorite writters</UTT>It is funny that he despised fan fiction and says it is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring actors.</UTT>I have to disagree with him there, a lot of fan fictions are actually pretty good</UTT>I agree with you. It is messed up that a judge in 1950 tried banning a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.</UTT>Thats racist, I hope that judge got sanctioned,</UTT>I also hope that. Do you like Dramas?</UTT>I like them one of my favorite shows is House, have you seen it before?</UTT>I think I watched like one episode before.</UTT>I see, well do you remember Hugh Laurie? the leading actor, the one that has a limp?</UTT>I do vaguely. He is the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama right?</UTT>He is he makes about $700,000 per episode, maybe a bit more now</UTT>Must be nice! Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?</UTT>No, did he had a calling since he was a little kid? I have no idea really</UTT>All the prettiest girls in his high school were in Drama class!</UTT>I see, well, clearly the decision led to a successful career path.</UTT>True! I love how Jim Carey does not make dramas anymore because of his belief system.</UTT>I respect that, Jim Carey is a great actor and positivity is a great emotion to share and experience with others</UTT>I also respect that. I agree with him that movies should project positivity more.</UTT>We should all be more like Jim Carey, have a positive mindset and dont let negativity affect us either way I hope you have a great night, its been great chatting</UTT>Thanks! Nice chatting with you as well!</UTT>1

Hi! Are you an Amazon Prime member?</UTT>Hello - yes I am. Are you?</UTT>Absolutely!  I have been doing business with Amazon almost as long as it has been around back in 1994.</UTT>Very good. Bezos build a clock into a mountain that can run for 10,000 years.</UTT>Nice. Is that to keep their shipments on time?  They use USPS on Sundays and they could use all the help they can get!</UTT>I love the shipments on Sunday's. I wonder if those workers get overtime for that?</UTT>Who knows?  The workers I worry about are all those warehouse workers who walk 15 miles every day!</UTT>That's a lot of walking. I saw Amazon also owns IMDB.</UTT>Yeah. Since 1998. I don't know when IMDB started streaming movies on Freedive though...</UTT>Interesting...Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Of course. I would have to be from Jupiter to not listen to radio, and even then, electromagnetic storms from Jupiter are so strong, they can be detected using AM radio on earth!</UTT>I would love to hear that. In Canada, all radio stations must play 40% of the Canadian music. Weird law I think.</UTT>They have a strong beaver lobby... But at least it does not apply to internet radio!  There is an internet site where you can listen to classic radio dramas. Have you heard it?</UTT>I have not heard of it. I would like to find it though. Soldiers in WWII made radios using pencils and razorblades.</UTT>If you use a pink pencil, you automaticallly tune to a Taylor Swift song...  But don't use a charcoal pencil. Then you recieve transmissions from a Finnish station that broadcasts news in classical Latin.</UTT>HAHA. Do you follow government?</UTT>I have learned to never follow after elephants and donkeys...or at least not without a shovel!</UTT>Haha. The government owns 86% of the land in Nevada.</UTT>Yeah, and the also wasted money buying the Eiffel Tower from a French dude impersonating a representative of the French government.  The best and the brightest...</UTT>That's hilarious! I can't imagine doing that.</UTT>Well, imagine you are the Norwegian government, and you just spent $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest ... Now they have to decide where they are going to store it...</UTT>That's pretty awesome they did that. It was good chatting with you today. Take care.</UTT>1

Hello, how are you today? What are your interests?</UTT>Hey there, I was so impressed with Aretha Franklin version of Amazing Grace. The sound was glorious and an epic moment.</UTT>You like music? Did you know  in 1972 that Pink Floyd recorded a live concert in an ancient Roman amphitheater in Pompeii without an audience?</UTT>Oh man, that is super cool. I love Pink Floyd. Wow, and even in Pompeii!</UTT>Me too! It is pretty cool. There is still a Roman amphitheater still in use today in Croatia.</UTT>That is amazing. I was a big fan of Creed but heard that they were actually sued for a band concert. I never saw them in person and I am sorta glad about it. Have you seen them?</UTT>Wow that is terrible. Some artist these days are pretty terrible live. They need the auto tune and whatever else they use to make them sound better recorded.</UTT>Yeah, that is a very good point. It must have been horrible to be sued for the performance. I saw the Ramones over 20 years ago and they played  2,263 concerts non stop for 20 years.</UTT>That's a crazy amount of concerts. i saw linkin park back in 2001 they performed 324 concerts that year alone.</UTT>Wow, they are super human. I relaly like the Oscars too. I think Daniel Day Lewis has won before. I really like him, hes my favorite actor.</UTT>Did you know that Walt Disney still holds the record for the most oscars won by a man, he won 22.</UTT>Noway! Thats crazy, I never knew that! My parents like Blazing Saddles, do you know if they ever won any awards.</UTT>Eminem has more oscars than Leonardo Decaprio, Johnny Depp, Will Smith, George Lucas and Bill Murry combined!</UTT>Man, that's a weird fact, huh. I watched the time that Jimmy Kimmel hosted because he is so funny and able to handle a big show like the Academy Awards.</UTT>I like when a comedian is the host. Another fact the oscars were nominated for 9 Emmy's in 2013 alone.</UTT>The awards they hand out are 24 different awards too , by the way.</UTT>I wasn't aware of that. Off topic but another interesting fact. Did you know that MdDonalds' added drive-thru's in 1975 for soldiers whom were not allowed to get ou tof vehicles in their fatigues.</UTT>Oh that s cool. I like that!! My kids are in the Navy!</UTT>Did you know that in South Africa is is legal to equip your car with flame-throwers to stop carjcking?</UTT>NOway, thats nuts! I did know that Jann Mardenborough became a pro driver based on learning how to drive from a video game. Wild, huh?</UTT>Interesting. Did you know that Cadillac is named after the founder of Detroit? French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac.</UTT>That is a super fun fact, cool!</UTT>It was nice chatting with you today!</UTT>1

Hey there. I heard that Laura Ingraham is being sued. Did you hear that yet?</UTT>Yeah, I heard that Laura was very demanding and when her assistant got pregnant she was fired.</UTT>Exactly! I guess that the assistant was having her first child which is also a factor in the lawsuit. I guess the poor girl had to work 7 days a week most of the time.</UTT>Yes, this does seem like a good case of pregnancy discrimination under FMLA and her district's Protecting Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.</UTT>Yes, it sounds legit to me too. Karolina Wilson stated that Laura Ingraham was not easily satisfied but that she was always happy with Ms. Wilson's work.</UTT>But Ingraham did let Wilson stay with the company for three weeks so she could get unemployment insurance. Hopefully this isn't just a case of a disgruntled worker who happened to be pregnant. What do you think?</UTT>Hmm? That is a valid point. The report states that Ms. Wilson was also angry about the inability to have a private area to pump breast milk for her child.</UTT>The company denies that Wilson was ever an efficient worker.</UTT>Oh, that changes things for sure. I am not sure that I see Laura Ingraham keeping an assistant more than a day whom she was not happy with.</UTT>That is true. It's tricky because it seems it's mostly one person's word against another.</UTT>Yes, I totally agree! Laura Ingraham's company has less than 20 employees so I think the law changes for smaller companies also.</UTT>Apparently Ingraham gave Wilson assignments on the day she was going into labor. There may be proof in text.</UTT>Yes, I agree!</UTT>But who knows, maybe her replacement is actually a better worker.</UTT>Yeah, that is America. We support fairness! I was eating lunch and remembering that Mcdonalds added drive-thru's to accommodate soldiers in 1975 who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing fatigues. Thats fair!</UTT>Sure is! Too bad the drive thrus kind of backfired and made a lot of Americans very lazy, haha</UTT>HA! That is pretty true! Great point! All those hamburgers did not help obesity.</UTT>Yeah, maybe we have to go back to the time before cars. It's surprising to believe that cars were just available to the masses only a little over a century ago. Before that most people walked and took animal drawn carriages and carts.</UTT>Yeah, that is amazing! Well, it is almost like rotary phones that dialed 212 area code the fastest.</UTT>I had one of those when I was little. I think it was after its time but my parents were too cheap to replace it.</UTT>That is a funny memory! Great!</UTT>Yeah, I even remember using the phonebook. Did you know it's impossible to separate two phonebooks that have their pages overlapped?</UTT>1

Hello do you like rap music?</UTT>I like Korean freestyle complement battle. You?</UTT>I have never seen or heard it but it sounds interesting. I like rap sometimes</UTT>I didn't know that Eminem dreamed of one day becoming a comic book artist. How do you like that street cred?</UTT>Yeah that is pretty cool. DO you like Tupac?</UTT>Ah, the artist listed in the library of congress under "cultural significance" is a mystery to me.</UTT>Yeah, I guess it was powerful music. A judge in Michigan gave the ruling in the forms of rap because it was a suit against Eminem</UTT>Nice...   Rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular...When it's put to music it can be spectacular.  Uh huh.</UTT>Yeah pretty awesome. On another topic, do you know much about presidents?</UTT>Yeah. The Pres of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Yeah I wonder if he is any good or if people listen to his music just because he is the president</UTT>Yeah, maybe they call him "President Banana" behind his back, like they called the first Pres of Zimbabwe?</UTT>Haha good point, maybe they do. DO you know much Obama?</UTT>Unfortunately, yes. When he visited India, they removed all the coconuts from around his destination.</UTT>Hmm interesting one. If you zoom in on Google Maps in the white house, you can see him there</UTT>While in office, FDR vetoed 635 bills during his presidency. Obama vetoed 2.</UTT>Yeah that is a huge difference. Do you know what his secret service codename was?</UTT>B.O.?</UTT>It was actually renegade, not sure who came with it though</UTT>It wopuld have been fun if the old rules were in place when BO ran for the president...the one where the runner up automatically gets to be VP.  Then Romney would have had to be Obama's flunky.</UTT>Yeah that is an interesting rule they had then. It was nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

I think it's interesting that in basketball, the teams will try to neutralize one best player, which is sometimes LeBron James, the Boston Celtics are actually researching it right now</UTT>I heard about "Defending LeBron James 101", do you know what it is?</UTT>I don't know what it is exactly, but I know they're trying to make sure that he is not a big part of a game when he plays, it makes sense though and I wish them luck but I think he's just too good</UTT>Do you watch NBA games on TV or live?</UTT>Well I like to watch NBA games on TV actually, I've never been to one in real life, what about you?</UTT>I watch them on tv with my adult son.  He likes them more than I do.  I understand that the league has 30 teams.</UTT>If they do, 29 in the United States and only one in Canada, the one in Canada is the Toronto Raptors I believe</UTT>That was interesting that there was one team in Canada.  I thought that all were within the US.</UTT>Yep just one team in Canada, what do you think about shooting granny style by the way? Apparently scientists say it's the best and most consistent way to shoot a basketball</UTT>Apparently NBA players avoid doing it because, according to them, it looks stupid.</UTT>But if I were paid $800,000 a year like Allen Iverson, I would shoot however is the best way LOL even if it looks stupid</UTT>I totally agree with you.  Tim Duncan decided to finish college instead of going directly to the NBA after high school.</UTT>Yeah that's interesting, he definitely lost money by doing that, interesting too that originally Air Jordans were banned by the NBA</UTT>About Tim,  I would be afraid that the offer would not be available after graduation.  Also, I heard about Air Jordans and the ban.</UTT>Yeah it's shocking that they were fining Michael Jordan, and so Michael Jordan asks Nike and Nike just paid the fine so he could keep wearing the shoes LOL</UTT>I'm sure Nike did not lose money by doing that - it might be the contrary.</UTT>I don't know they probably need money because of the Genius Bar LOL. What do you think about LeBron James? he's probably going to make a lot of money for being in the new Space Jam movie</UTT>Is that a sequel?  If it is, who was the main actor on the original one?</UTT>Yes it is a sequel. The original actor was Michael Jordan, I bet he will have a cameo in it though</UTT>I see.  Thank you for the infor.  Lebron James is a good person.  He raised 6 M dollars for charity.</UTT>Yeah he seems like a nice guy. He also rejected an offer from Reebok for 10 million dollars, only to one year later accept an offer from Nike for 90 million, he's apparently a business genius</UTT>1

He also rejected an offer from Reebok for 10 million dollars, only to one year later accept an offer from Nike for 90 million, he's apparently a business genius</UTT>Yeah it's shocking that they were fining Michael Jordan, and so Michael Jordan asks Nike and Nike just paid the fine so he could keep wearing the shoes LOL</UTT>0
The Patriots are a real power house team in the NFL.</UTT>They no longer play in Boston anymore.  They are based in Foxborough.</UTT>Yes, I knew they no longer played in the Boston area. It seems like almost a given that the Patriots will be in the Super Bowl or the playoffs ever year.</UTT>They have been there so many time that they have lost four times, as many as the Bills.</UTT>I'm normally not a big Tom Brady fan. But, I might have to change my opinion about him, since he came out of the Big Ten.</UTT>He didn't seem that good when he was playing with Michigan.  Who knew?</UTT>I don't remember him playing with Michigan actually.</UTT>As good as Brady is, his wife makes twice as much money as he does.</UTT>That's funny, isn't it? She owns hotels and some apparel lines, too.</UTT>When Brady was on his JV high school team, he didn't even get a start even though the team was winless.</UTT>At Michigan, he was the backup quarterback, and he even had to fight for his starting spot, too. I wonder what pushed him over the top.</UTT>Maybe it's because he has never eaten a strawberry.</UTT>LOL! Maybe strawberries are his cryptonite!</UTT>He and coach Belichick together have won five Super Bowls, that's a lot.</UTT>It is a lot. He has been to the Super Bowl eight times. I wonder if the Patriots will make it again this year.</UTT>If Brady wins one more, he will break the tie with Charles Haley for most Super Bowl wins.</UTT>That's awesome. Maybe that is the reason Tom Brady is waiting to retire.</UTT>When he does, he has his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen to go home to.  Not a bad way to retire.</UTT>Nope. And, I'm sure he will be doing a bunch of commercials and spots like Peyton Manning.</UTT>Or maybe he can master video games and become as good as Baker Mayfield</UTT>That could be! It's been fun chatting with you!</UTT>1

Good Morning.  Just finished placing an order with Amazon.  Their founder, Jeff Bezos, has been in the news a lot lately.</UTT>Yeah. Even with giving up half his stuff, he'll still be in the top 10 richest list...</UTT>And his ex wife will be up there too.  He Founded Amazon in 1994.  It doesn't feel like that long ago.</UTT>The first amazon.com customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him. I wish I had a building named after me...</UTT>I just wish I had 1% of his fortune.  And it's crazy to think that Alibaba Group is even larger.</UTT>I know. I wanted to buy into Amazon at like $500 per share and now it's at like $1800. I kick myself everytime I am looking at the ticker and it comes up. I did get Alibaba early in that process....</UTT>That was a smart move.  I try to buy on the dips as well, but Amazon is so expensive.  Did you know their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day?</UTT>I worked at Office Max warehouse and I believe it. The worst part is the summers when there's no air and you're just sweating! Amazon ceo jeff bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years.</UTT>If he has that kind of money, you'd think he's finalize his own delivery fleet.  As of now he has the USPS delivering for him on Sundays.</UTT>Yeah... He has enough to buy IMDB. I had no clue...</UTT>They sell everything:  toys, electronics, furniture, food, jewelry.  I even bought a big screen tv from them.</UTT>Did you really buy a TV from them? White glove service too?</UTT>Yup, 65 inch Samsung.  Pretty sweet set.  They brought it in, unwrapped it, put it on the stand, and took away the packaging...  They also sell low-end products under the name Amazon Basics.</UTT>I was going to order a TV from them but got cold feet and didn't pull the trigger. I do like their Basic stuff... In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization. Amazon is the third most valuable public company in the United States (behind Apple and Microsoft), the largest Internet company by revenue in the world, and after Walmart, the second largest employer in the United States.</UTT>Pretty amazing statistics.  I wasn't aware they were the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure.  They are just going to grow bigger and bigger...</UTT>I know. They are now looking at empty Sears stores for their Whole Foods stores...</UTT>I heard that as well.  Well, it's been a pleasure speaking with you.  I hope you have a great weekend.</UTT>Cs lewis and tolkien held "you laugh you lose" competitions when reading terrible poetry</UTT>I was unaware of that.  I did know though that speed readers can process over 1000 words per minute though.</UTT>How many can they comprehend though... I would only get about 4 words...</UTT>Yeah, me as well.  Gotta run and get some stuff done before the NFL games come on.  Have a good day.</UTT>You too!</UTT>1
How many can they comprehend though... I would only get about 4 words...</UTT>nice!  What was the last concert you went to?  Did you know Due to the success of their debut album, linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.  Thats a lot of shows!!</UTT>That was a smart move.  I try to buy on the dips as well, but Amazon is so expensive.  Did you know their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day?</UTT>Good Morning.

Did you ever watch ET?</UTT>Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!</UTT>Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that?</UTT>No, I haven't see it.  Have you?</UTT>I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.</UTT>Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it!</UTT>Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.</UTT>It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!</UTT>Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems. I can totally imagine this happening in the future.</UTT>OMG, goodness, alot of people would def get hooked on that! Do you watch alot of movies?</UTT>I don't really though I like Disney movies. How about you?</UTT>Me too, I love Disney movies.  I read that Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped.</UTT>I didn't even know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop! Treasure Planet was also a Disney movie and was the most expensive box office flops of all times.</UTT>I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can't remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star.</UTT>Would  you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.</UTT>I remember seeing it, but it wasn't on Valentine's day!</UTT>Trojan Wars on the other hand ws a failure. It had a 15 million budget and earned only $309 in box office.</UTT>That's pitiful!</UTT>Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>Awesome, I read somewhere that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5 1/2 hours.</UTT>Wow, I can't even get enough done in 24 hours!</UTT>1
I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.</UTT>yes , i have hiked it . my cats hike with me , ever since they were kittens .</UTT>Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>No, I haven't see it.

Hey there my friend you ever watch football on television?</UTT>I do not follow football but I do watch it occassionally.</UTT>I watch the Super Bowl. I don't normally watch a lot of sports though. Do you like the Patriots? They have a player that has never fumbled the ball before. His name is Benjarvus Green-Ellis</UTT>No I do not like the Patriots.  I think that is a former player though,  Yes that is impressive,  I wonder why this guy isnt more known</UTT>Yes I agree with you. Like I said I don't really watch sports so I'm not sure if he's a current player or not haha. What I do know is that ESPN won an Emmy. They created that yellow line that shows the first downs on football games</UTT>good for them!  I hear the highest score in football was 222-0!  That is crazy!</UTT>I know right! I can't believe that Georgia Tech was that much better. I would have left the stands once it got to 100 to 0 LOL</UTT>I know right,  lol me too!</UTT>What are your thoughts on Eli Manning? I know that he was super dominant back when he played.</UTT>I know Eli is short for Elisha.</UTT>That is really weird. Also I didn't know he was born in 1981. I've never heard the name Elicia before. also apparently he has a genius-level IQ</UTT>Thats amazing!  Is he related to Taryn Manning?  Shes from orange is the new black.</UTT>Oh I didn't know that. I've never seen that show so I have no idea. I guess he is the son of NFL quarterback Archie Manning in the younger brother of NFL quarterback Peyton Manning. It's definitely in their blood to be good quarterbacks haha</UTT>I dont know if he is related to her,  I was just asking. Yeah thats interesting.  I guess they just have that natural talent.</UTT>Did you know that the NFL uses tracking chips in the shoulder pads? They can track the location and position of all the players as well as the ball</UTT>Thats that is really cool,  they also put it in the football.</UTT>Yep you're right. They can tell the ball speed ,location, rotation and velocity, I just hope that they stopped the tracking after the players leave the field haha that would be super awkward</UTT>Its in their shoulder pads,  so I guess it depends where they take those lol</UTT>Haha yep well as long as they don't take anywhere those home LOL. What do you think of the fact that the NFL game on average only has about 11 minutes of gameplay, that seems solo to me</UTT>yeah that crazy, too many time outs, breaks,  commercials</UTT>Yep it gets annoying after a while. I wonder if we will ever have a female player, do you think that we will? There's no rule against it apparently</UTT>1

I've never heard the name Elicia before. also apparently he has a genius-level IQ</UTT>I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment</UTT>I watch the Super Bowl. I don't normally watch a lot of sports though. Do you like the Patriots? They have a player that has never fumbled the ball before.

Do you like watching sports?</UTT>don't have a lot of time to do that... sometimes...</UTT>What about television in general?</UTT>Tv shows and movies sometimes...</UTT>Sometimes I watch the Simpsons. There's only one episode where Bart does not appear and isn't mentioned.</UTT>wow :) they did alright without Bart ? I love cartoons like that - where they show cool satire on current events ;)</UTT>Yeah, I never got into anime cartoons though. There were 750 episodes of Pokemon made so I know they were highly popular.</UTT>Yeah... I mean my friends were always watching that... I could never convince myself to start...  the drawing looked like manga and the only manga cartoon I watched was about soccer and it was called "captain Tsubasa" ;)</UTT>Did you ever watch that 70s show?</UTT>Maybe an episode or two :) Not a fan of Ashton Kutcher</UTT>Apparently it was so popular that they made it verbatim in the UK. But it didn't work out as it was cancelled after ten episodes.</UTT>Did they air our American show or make their own ?</UTT>They remade it word for word.</UTT>word for word in actual english ? Maybe with their accent it's not so funny :)</UTT>Yeah, that  could have been it. Sometimes I try to watch NFL games but I find them boring. Maybe it's because there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.</UTT>Yeah, I mean the game is being interrupted every couple of seconds... I can't watch that ;) my blood is boiling when I do :) lol</UTT>Yes, that is true. Our society takes football so seriously that tracking chips are embedded in shoulder pads and in footballs.</UTT>I heard about that...  is that really helping in... yeah, in what exactly ? :)</UTT>I'm not sure if it's for data purposes or if it helps make sure everything is fair.</UTT>Not sure either... so what do You think about female players join the game ? ;)</UTT>I think it would be great if they could meet eligibility requirements.</UTT>1

Hello - what do you like to do for entertainment?</UTT>Hi yes I love entertainment! I like the NFL it's as good entertainment as it gets! The NFL has no written rule against girls playing!</UTT>That's pretty cool. I wonder if a woman will join soon. Pretty crazy the average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>Yeah that is surprising...Football players actually don't make all that much money. Over the course of a lifetime, engineers make more!</UTT>Yeah that is also surprising. And the NFL uses tracking chips on the players and the footballs.</UTT>Oh that's cool. Hopefully to get information on how to protect players more. It is kind of interesting the New Orleans Saints cheerladers can't eat at the same restaurant as the players.</UTT>Yeah that is kind of a silly rule I think.</UTT>Agreed. I also like to play video games and I used to have the original NES Nintendo. It only could display 54 colors but it impressed me!</UTT>The NES was discontinued in 2003 in Japan. I liked playing the NES also, I still have mine.</UTT>That's awesome! Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment exec said he didn't look presidential. Little did he know...</UTT>That's funny. And Bill Nye made it into the entertainment industry by winning a steve martin lookalike contest!</UTT>Oh wow interesting. I think if I played football I would want to be the quarterback. I would want to call plays in the huddle!</UTT>Oh cool - the huddle was created by Paul d. Hubbard. He was deaf. He used the huddle so that others teams couldn't read his hand signals!</UTT>That's a cool origin story of the huddle! The QB Alex Smith got his degree in 2 years in college because he took so many AP classes!</UTT>That's pretty impressive. Kellan moore is the only left-handed QB in the NFL.</UTT>Oh wow. Yeah now that I think of it all QB's are right handed. Tom Brady's highschool had a bad season when they never won a game or score a touchdown. Brady was the back up and he didn't even play! Hard to believe.</UTT>Yeah that is hard to believe - look at him now.</UTT>Football is a tough game. They play for 17 weeks straight with only one week off during the season.</UTT>Yeah it is - I could never do it. Well it has been nice talking to you - have a good day!</UTT>You as well! Have a good day!</UTT>:)</UTT>1

Do you play golf ?</UTT>Sure do! I try to hit the links at least one weekend a month. do you?</UTT>Yes, I do, I like being outdoors, and I like that each course is different.</UTT>I also loved playing Mario Golf as a kid back in the day</UTT>Yeah, playing golf in videos games could solve the water consumption issues of golf.</UTT>yea i bet it uses a lot of water for the sprinklers to water the course</UTT>In the US a course uses 312000 galons of water every day. It is kind of wasteful, doesn't it ?</UTT>thats insanely wasteful. I hope they recycle their water somehow!</UTT>I don't think  they can recycle the water once it is on the course, but rich people like to play golf, there is a golf course in dubai.</UTT>Sam Jackson gets to play often, he makes sure his film contacts allow him to play twice a week</UTT>Celebrities like to play golf, like Babe Ruth, he was the most famous golfer.</UTT>back in his day yea, but nowadays there are so many more famous players</UTT>Do you like to watch golf ? Or just play Mario golf ?</UTT>watching it is a snooze, i prefer to play it. you?</UTT>I don't like watching golf as entertainment, as you said, it is boring. But each person has his preferences, in Roman times, people bred chicken for entertainment.</UTT>now THAT sounds boring to me</UTT>If you were bored of your chicken, you could eat it.</UTT>well i guess thats a big upseide to it haha. Did you know the original NES could only show 52 colors?</UTT>I though it was 54, but I am really impressed what they could do with only 54 colors. maybe that is why they still sold it in 2003.</UTT>youre right! it is 54. It was a huge success in its day</UTT>What was you favorite game on the Nintendo entertainment system ?</UTT>I was big fan of the MegaMan games. How about you?</UTT>I liked racing games, but Mega Man was a really good game. I always started with metal man.</UTT>gotta get that Metal Blade as early as possible!</UTT>1
Do you play golf ?</UTT>Sure do! I try to hit the links at least one weekend a month. do you?</UTT>now THAT sounds boring to me</UTT>I also loved playing Mario Golf as a kid back in the day</UTT>watching it is a snooze, i prefer to play it. you?</UTT>yea i bet it uses a lot of water for the sprinklers to water the course</UTT>Do you like to watch golf ? Or just play Mario golf ?</UTT>thats insanely wasteful. I hope they recycle their water somehow!</UTT>What was you favorite game on the Nintendo entertainment system ?</UTT>Sam Jackson gets to play often, he makes sure his film contacts allow him to play twice a week</UTT>I don't think  they can recycle the water once it is on the course, but rich people like to play golf, there is a golf course in dubai.</UTT>back in his day yea, but nowadays there are so many more famous players</UTT>In the US a course uses 312000 galons of water every day. It is kind of wasteful, doesn't it ?</UTT>well i guess thats a big upseide to it haha. Did you know the original NES could only show 52 colors?</UTT>I though it was 54, but I am really impressed what they could do with only 54 colors. maybe that is why they still sold it in 2003.</UTT>I don't like watching golf as entertainment, as you said, it is boring. But each person has his preferences, in Roman times, people bred chicken for entertainment.</UTT>I liked racing games, but Mega Man was a really good game. I always started with metal man.</UTT>If you were bored of your chicken, you could eat it.</UTT>Yes, I do, I like being outdoors, and I like that each course is different.</UTT>youre right! it is 54. It was a huge success in its day</UTT>Yeah, playing golf in videos games could solve the water consumption issues of golf.</UTT>I was big fan of the MegaMan games. How about you?</UTT>Celebrities like to play golf, like Babe Ruth, he was the most famous golfer.</UTT>gotta get that Metal Blade as early as possible!</UTT>0
Do you still get a chance to listen to the radio?</UTT>Hello there, I do, I found a really good local station that I like, how about you?</UTT>I do. Did you know that the storms in Jupiter are so strong that they can be heard on an AM radio?</UTT>I think I have read about that before, that is really amazing!</UTT>I agree. Were you aware that you can make a radio with very little?</UTT>I think so, I think soldiers in WWI make them using a razorblade and a pencil.</UTT>Yes they did. They called them foxhole radios.</UTT>Good call!  I think any information or any form of entertainment they could get was well welcomed.</UTT>I'm sure it was. Have you heard any of the old radio dramas that were very popular beforeTV?</UTT>No I don't think I have, but I do know there is a website where you can listen to tons of them for free.</UTT>There is. I wonder if they still hold up?</UTT>I bet they do, but still are dated.  I think there are some real gems hidden in that bunch.</UTT>You're probably right. Did you know that by law 40% of music played on Canadian radio has to be Canadian?</UTT>I think I have heard about that, sounds pretty funny, but I bet the Canadian bands like it.</UTT>I would imagine so. So strange that they had to make a law. Are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>I am not, I think most of politics is just fighting to stay in position, how about you?</UTT>I agree with you but I also think it's important so I do have an interest. Did you know that until 1805 the runner up in a presidential race became the VP? Can you imagine that now?</UTT>That is very true.  And yeah isn't that wild, it would be a reality show for sure!</UTT>It would be crazy. On the lighter side, do yo know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?</UTT>I think he was called president Banana!  But, I think it was because his actual name was that.</UTT>He was! I'm not sure if that was his born name.</UTT>1

Are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>You're probably right. Did you know that by law 40% of music played on Canadian radio has to be Canadian?</UTT>I had heard that as well. Lucky for them. I forget that the company began as an online bookstore. They've come so crazy far since then.</UTT>No I don't think I have, but I do know there is a website where you can listen to tons of them for free.</UTT>Do you still get a chance to listen to the radio?</UTT>I'm sure it was.

Do you enjoy music?</UTT>I love music. How about you?</UTT>I enjoy country music</UTT>I like country music as well, not my favorite but i do enjoy some of it. Isnt it also called western and hillbilly music?</UTT>By some. It became popular since ford helped finance its spread out of fear of jazz</UTT>There are only two African Americans in the hall of fame for country music, so i guess it's not for everyone. still i enjoy it.</UTT>I wonder if it was a issue of talent or race</UTT>Not sure, some music just isn't for everyone. I can't do hard core heavy metal and I don't like the rap music today.</UTT>I think some rap is okay, but I agree with heavy metal. That music is just painful to hear, but hey it is a subjective topic. It is interesting how the fender stratocaster was originally intended for country music though</UTT>George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins.</UTT>What an amazing coincidence. Do you enjoy listening to music on radio or through albums?</UTT>probably the radio.How about You</UTT>I actually only listen through albums. I never really used the radio</UTT>Did you know there are storms on Jupiter that can be picked up by AM radio due to the strength of the storm?</UTT>I wonder what kinds of sounds you can pick up. I wonder if a foxhole radio could pick up Jupiter's storm as well</UTT>Not sure about that. Radio along with technology has come a long way.</UTT>I wonder if it is still often used in day to day life. I know there is a website to listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free, but not really sure how often people today use radios</UTT>Canada has made it law that 40% of its radio music is Canadian.</UTT>I guess that is one way to encourage the use of Canadian. Not sure how many people in Canada use radios though</UTT>Do you like Linkin Park?</UTT>I think they play wonderful music, especially their album hybrid theory</UTT>Did you know that it was the best selling album of the 21st century. wow!</UTT>Indeed that's why I checked it out. In any case thank you for the enjoyable chat.</UTT>1

Hey do you like baseball by the way? What do you think about the Nationals</UTT>I'm a big baseball fan!  I think they will do ok even though they lost Bryce Harper.  It's kind of the same situation like how they lost Jayson Werth a few years ago.</UTT>Speaking of baseball did you know that a baseball manager can actually play for the team if necessary?</UTT>That would be interesting to see!  That's one rule I didn't know.</UTT>Yep that's why they wear uniforms, also weird is that in Canada people is known as soccer baseball</UTT>That's interesting too!  Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games for 24 years.</UTT>That seems like a lot of work! Do you know why they stopped? The guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic is a very lucky dude!</UTT>I don't know why they stopped.  I know I would stop working if I found a million dollars worth of baseball cards!  lol</UTT>Yep I could think of a lot of things to do with a million dollars lOL and I would be very happy that my grandfather had them in the Attic</UTT>Yes!  No doubt.  Did you know that the womens world cup had a higher tv ratings than the world series in the US?</UTT>No I didn't know that that's crazy. also crazy is that baseball is super popular in Japan, they even think that it is their National Pastime and not ours LOL</UTT>lol  Babe Ruth who was known for home runs was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series?  Interesting useless stat.  lol</UTT>Haha what's an interesting stat. Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I know that's a change of topic</UTT>I've seen it but don't follow it close.  I know it got financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.</UTT>Yep you're right about that. I think it first premiered back in 2011 which seems like a long time ago, I can't wait for the new season to start in April</UTT>The next season is supposed to be the last one correct?</UTT>Yes it will be the last one. It's crazy that Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is actually in Game of Thrones, I forget who she is though</UTT>Wow.  I never knew that.  How neat.  I'm going to have to binge watch it and get caught up before the last season begins.  I've heard that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most like because of Game of Thrones.</UTT>Haha you're right about that! And yes you should definitely check it out, they even made a knockoff series about lions called game of lions LOL</UTT>That's funny!  I see that Harry Lloyd who is on there is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens.  That is neat they have 2 people related to famous people from a long time ago.</UTT>Yep I agree with you. There's even a guy who is the great grandson of Charles Dickens LOL they've got everyone in the show</UTT>1

Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !</UTT>Me too!  What do you think of the new NFL rule?</UTT>What is the new rule ?</UTT>regarding whether a QB is a runner or a passer and how they handle the hit on the quarterback</UTT>I think everybody will get used to it in time :) Did You know that Tom brady's wife, gisele bundchen, makes more than double her husband's salary ?</UTT>Oh wow... did not know that! Did you see Tom Brady's HS team had the worst season where they did not scor a touchdown and never once tried to bring in their back up QB who was Tom Brady?</UTT>What ? That sounds silly... why would they do that ?</UTT>No clue! How about kellan moore being the only QB in the NFL that is left handed... that's crazy!</UTT>I've heard that but I don't believe it... there has to be more like that...</UTT>you would think so... but why would that be a fact then?  What's even crazier is that NO Saint cheerleaders have to leave a restaraunt if a NO Saint player comes in</UTT>? why is that ? They have to hang out together ? ;)</UTT>I know right!  i guess they don't want them fratinizing!</UTT>I wouldn't mind to watch :)</UTT>To watch what?</UTT>fraternizing- sorry, I always see things with a sexual twist... lol</UTT>LOL... you must be a dude!  lmao!</UTT>Yeah... we are pigs ;)  but at least honest pigs ! ;)</UTT>that we are!!! See how they use tracking chips in pads and footballs?</UTT>I mean I've red that, but how does it help in an actual game ?</UTT>with statistics... and you know stats are part of the game! like there are only 11 minutes of gameplay</UTT>Yeah... that's one of the reasons I'm not really watching the games... the game is keep being interrupted...</UTT>true!  but i still watch!   maybe one day there will be a female player since there is no rule against them playing</UTT>Why should there be a rule like that ;) it would be interesting ;)</UTT>Definitely!  but then you would have to build a seperate locker room ofr them... LOL</UTT>oh c'mon, gender equality in sports ;) no way, they are changing with the boys :) lol</UTT>yeah right!  the feminist would have a field day! LMAO  What the... Tom Brady's wife makes more than he does!</UTT>Yeah... google how she looks... You'll understand... ;) lol</UTT>no need.. got her in my brain :p ALright... i'm out!  have a good one!</UTT>1

I am a huge NFL fan, how about you?I was mad the Patriots won the superbowl this year. I love the NFL because it is the highest professional level of football in the world!</UTT>Can't say I'm a huge fan.  I know my local teams but not much more, used to live in DC and now in the Cleveland area.  I'm fully aware of how much the Browns suck.</UTT>Oh nice. LOL yes they have definitely had their troubles! Have you ever played football? I never have but I would want to be quarterback because they are the leader of the offensive team.</UTT>Never, I played the other football, soccer.  Are you aware of this Derrius Guice player and his injury?</UTT>Oh nice, that is a good game as well. Yeah he tore his ACL what a disaster for him. Terrible injury. He hyperextended his knee while being tackled-ouch!</UTT>I always hear of players doing their ACL, I never really know what that means.</UTT>Yeah it i the ligament that prevents your thigh bone from moving anterior to your leg bone. Very common and very bad-need surgery to correct it. And he had some denial claiming that he could walk after the injury-sad that he didn't want his rookie season to end!</UTT>I'm sure he'll get the best treatment.  Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?  Even if you did want the Patriots to lose.</UTT>Yes I did. It wasn't a great game-very low scoring. Commercials were good though. Did you watch? The Patriots are like the Lannisters of the NFL (if you watch the game of thrones).</UTT>My niece always has birthday party on that weekend and we feel obliged to go since it's family.  My wife loves Game of Thrones so I end up watching with her.  I assume the Lannisters aren't good.</UTT>Oh nice. Yeah the Lannisters are the ones who hold power and always want control and power. The Patriots coach, Bill Belichick is the most winningest coach in the nfl post season with 21 wins. Quite respectable.</UTT>Wasn't there all that spying stuff with them, and deflate gate?</UTT>Yea there was! That was a huge scandal. They did get put on some probation for that but that's about it. Did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL?</UTT>I wonder if it makes a difference.  I know in some sports being left handed can be a advantage.  It's funny that Tom Brady couldn't make his high school at times.</UTT>Yeah thats a good point. Yes that is hard to believe-now he is considered the greatest of all time. That shows that natural abilities aren't everything! Apparently the football huddle was created by a deaf quarterback. pretty interesting.</UTT>I wasn't aware that Belichick had coached the Browns.  That was a long time ago, Cleveland winning a playoff game.</UTT>Oh yeah I didn't know that either. They have had a tough go thats for sure. Their last playoff win was back in 1995-wow!</UTT>Was that before they moved to Baltimore.  I know there's a lot of bad blood around here because of that.  Is there much difference with Canadian football?</UTT>Yeah good question I'm not sure. Yes there are definitely differences with the CFL not sure what exactly though. I know the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) was actually cut from the CFL before he started wrestling!</UTT>He looks like a football player.  So who is your favorite NFL team?</UTT>My favorite team is the Seattle Seahawks since that is where I'm from. Also thats why I don't like the Patriots-they beat us in the Superbowl a few years back.</UTT>I've heard you have a noisy stadium, is that true?</UTT>Yeah I have been to a game before and it is deafening! Can't even hear yourself talk. It was a great time but I prefer to watch games on tv-just more comfortable.</UTT>Have a good day, goodbye.</UTT>You too bye!</UTT>Bye</UTT>1

Kristen Bell's TV show "The Good Place" sounds interesting. I haven't seen it, but I have heard it is very funny.</UTT>Ive seen the first season,  it is great!  very funny!</UTT>What did you think of the plot twist at the end of the season? That seems hilarious.</UTT>It definitely something I wasnt expecting!  Its super funny when she is in heaven and heaven censors all her cursing lol "what the shirt" "holy fork"</UTT>I think I'll have to watch it, then. That sounds hysterical! Has season 2 come out yet?</UTT>Yes it has!  I just started watching it.  its kind of frustrating though.  I guess Ill have to keep watching.</UTT>Frustrating in what way? Is it a rehash of the first season?</UTT>No.  at the end of season one,  michael resets them.  so season 2 they have no memory and they figure out they know each other and michael finds out they figured it out and resets them again......etc  Its like Im not sure where they are goin with this</UTT>Gotcha. Does it seem like a commentary on religion or God? I have heard that it seems like an analogy for heaven / hell.</UTT>They definitely touch on God and it is set in heaven /hell.  No mention of religion at all from what I remember.</UTT>Cool. I'm a Christian with a well developed sense of humor, but I don't like overtly disparaging commentary. There is enough on TV that is trash without adding to it.</UTT>Its made in good taste.  Its a really fun comedy.  Kristen Bell is amazing! Do you watch a lot of tv?  did u know There is only one episode of "the simpsons" where bart neither appears, nor is mentioned</UTT>I don't really watch much TV, to be honest. We "cut the cord" a few years ago. That is interesting about the Simpsons! I haven't seen that show in years, but I don't remember one with no Bart. I'll have to try to find that one on YouTube!</UTT>Yeah me too!</UTT>Speaking of interesting TV and film trivia, do you remember that in 1997 the show "3rd Rock from the Sun" won the golden globe for best comedy? It beat out "Frasier", "Friends", and "Seinfeld"! I did not remember that!</UTT>I dont remember that either,  but that show was so fun! There are over 750 episodes of "pokemon." that's about 50 a year for 16 years straight.</UTT>LOL. There is so much TV and movie trivia out there! It is amazing to think that in just a couple of generations, really, TV and film has become such an integral part of our popular culture.</UTT>I know right!  And way too many good shows to even keep up with!</UTT>Exactly!  Sometimes it takes me 15 minutes or longer to find something to watch when I am searching on Netflix or Amazon. There are so many choices, and I'm only able to see what they actually have in their library!</UTT>Right!  I always try n go for recommendations from friends I cant deal with looking for stuff.  An hour will pass and I still wont find anything lol</UTT>Same here, but I do like the "because you watched X" feature. It helps me find additional programming similar to what I know I like.</UTT>nice talkin to u,  have a good one.  Hope u enjoy The Good Life!</UTT>1
No.  at the end of season one,  michael resets them.  so season 2 they have no memory and they figure out they know each other and michael finds out they figured it out and resets them again......etc  Its like Im not sure where they are goin with this</UTT>Ive seen the first season,  it is great!  very funny!</UTT>Gotcha. Does it seem like a commentary on religion or God? I have heard that it seems like an analogy for heaven / hell.</UTT>Frustrating in what way? Is it a rehash of the first season?</UTT>nice talkin to u,  have a good one.  Hope u enjoy The Good Life!</UTT>Right!  I always try n go for recommendations from friends I cant deal with looking for stuff.  An hour will pass and I still wont find anything lol</UTT>Yeah me too!</UTT>They definitely touch on God and it is set in heaven /hell.  No mention of religion at all from what I remember.</UTT>Yes it has!  I just started watching it.  its kind of frustrating though.  I guess Ill have to keep watching.</UTT>Cool. I'm a Christian with a well developed sense of humor, but I don't like overtly disparaging commentary. There is enough on TV that is trash without adding to it.</UTT>Exactly!  Sometimes it takes me 15 minutes or longer to find something to watch when I am searching on Netflix or Amazon. There are so many choices, and I'm only able to see what they actually have in their library!</UTT>It definitely something I wasnt expecting!  Its super funny when she is in heaven and heaven censors all her cursing lol "what the shirt" "holy fork"</UTT>Its made in good taste.  Its a really fun comedy.  Kristen Bell is amazing! Do you watch a lot of tv?  did u know There is only one episode of "the simpsons" where bart neither appears, nor is mentioned</UTT>LOL. There is so much TV and movie trivia out there! It is amazing to think that in just a couple of generations, really, TV and film has become such an integral part of our popular culture.</UTT>Kristen Bell's TV show "The Good Place" sounds interesting. I haven't seen it, but I have heard it is very funny.</UTT>Same here, but I do like the "because you watched X" feature. It helps me find additional programming similar to what I know I like.</UTT>they also now have chips inside the footballs to track velocity, rotation speed and location. just crazy how they add technology</UTT>I don't really watch much TV, to be honest. We "cut the cord" a few years ago. That is interesting about the Simpsons! I haven't seen that show in years, but I don't remember one with no Bart. I'll have to try to find that one on YouTube!</UTT>I know right!  And way too many good shows to even keep up with!</UTT>I dont remember that either,  but that show was so fun! There are over 750 episodes of "pokemon." that's about 50 a year for 16 years straight.</UTT>I think I'll have to watch it, then. That sounds hysterical! Has season 2 come out yet?</UTT>What did you think of the plot twist at the end of the season? That seems hilarious.</UTT>0
Good morning!</UTT>Good morning!  How do you feel about the safe space movement?</UTT>I honestly have never heard of it. What is it about?</UTT>It is where kids are to be free from bullying, and stuff like that.  Sometimes its blown out of proportion saying kids should have it easy, but thats not really the case.</UTT>I wouldn't think so. How does not allowing bullying make kids soft?</UTT>I guess they are claiming kids need to learn to deal with adversity and stick up for them selves.  I just think we all need to be nicer.</UTT>I got to agree with you. I had to tolerate my son being bullied. Once he stood up for himself it stopped. But it should not have happened at all. I think it's wrong.</UTT>I agree.  I teach martial arts, and we teach the kids to just be strong and confident, people dont pick on strong confident people.</UTT>Thats a great thing to do! I take kids fishing. Really get to know them in the county. Do you fish?</UTT>I do not.  I have a hard time touching them, so slimy.</UTT>They can be. The kids love it though.Did you know freshwater fish drink water through osmosis and not their mouth?</UTT>No, thats pretty cool!  I do know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.</UTT>Isn't that wild! Scientists are studying it too! 87% of genes that are found in humans are also found in zebra fish.I wonder if they get the common cold?</UTT>Maybe, it could also help us cure things.  Maybe it can get on board with that jellyfish and we can start trying to cure cancer</UTT>God, that would be wonderful. I read that seahorses are the only fish that have necks too!</UTT>I guess I never thought about that before, but it makes sense.</UTT>Just a fun little fact I heard on the radio. Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Sometimes, but more into podcasts right now.   There is so much variety on the radio though.</UTT>I don't listen to many podcasts. Is there a website for them? I've been looking to listen to Jupiters storms myself.</UTT>I just listen on an app called podcoin, you collect points for podcasts you listen too.  I want to hear Jupiter's storms myself.  I bet they are interesting.</UTT>I'll have to look into that, thank you. I did look up the website where you can listen to old radio dramas. It was really funny!</UTT>That is cool, Ill have to check that out then.  It sounded interesting!</UTT>I listened to a horror one. Laughed my butt off. They are like from the 30's. Did you know in canada they have to play 40% of canadian music?</UTT>I heard that, I guess they are Jamming out to Bieber and Drake all day</UTT>And Celine dion! Have a good day!</UTT>1

hi how are you? do you like to dance?</UTT>I do but I am not great! Did you know Tupac danced ballet in high school?</UTT>i heard that. I guess he was a talented guy in many ways.</UTT>Yes, I agree. I guess professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.</UTT>i figure that ballet must be hard on the feet too. i would not want to do it. then again, i cant</UTT>I would not  either. Do you know babies dance spontaneously when they hear dance music. With the internet we can really see a lot of entertaining videos.</UTT>yes, quite true. much more entertainment in our lives. i wonder if it is a good thing though.</UTT>Well, I know that constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain.</UTT>i believe that. anything that releases chemicals can become an addiction.</UTT>I'm not sure. Hard to believe there is 3g cell service and internet capabilities at the peak of Mt. Everest.</UTT>i believe it. people need to upload their selfies. it is a great opportunity to show off to your followers.</UTT>I guess so. Amazing how Facebook has changed our lives. It's hard to believe it was launched 2-4-04.</UTT>yeah, it has changed a lot of lives. probably caused a lot of divorces too. LOL</UTT>It's hard to believe Myspace turned down an offer to buy FB for $75 million in early 2005!</UTT>yeah, they missed their chance to get it at a bargain. i wonder how fb would have turned out then.</UTT>I never thought about it that way, but yeah. Funny that Burger King had a promotion that offered you a Whopper if you unfriended 10 people on FB. Too funny.</UTT>I wonder how many people partipated in that campaign. free calories for dumping your friends.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder. Did you know FB is primarily blue because the founder is red-green colorblind?</UTT>I heard that. Mark should spend some money on finding a cure. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>I wonder if there is a cure. I am surprised that FB allows anyone that claims to be 13 to get an account. Wow!</UTT>pretty young for social media. Have a good day!</UTT>I agree. You have a good day as well. Bye.</UTT>1

Hi.  Are you a fan of the Patriots American football team?</UTT>I'm not a fan, but I don't hate them either. I saw their owner Kraft just got in trouble.</UTT>Yeah, I heard about that.  I also not a fan but Brady is worthy of respect.</UTT>Brady is probably going to be the best QB in NFL history. I think the sport is in decline. I'm a fan, but the younger generations don't watch it as much.</UTT>I haven't noticed it.  I think selfish fools like Kaepernick are hurting the game by bringing their politics to a pastime that people go to avoid such things.</UTT>I'm sure that doesn't help, most people can't stand politics.</UTT>Politics seems to be in EVERYTHING now.  Sick of it... I bet Pats fans aren't sick of their red zone effectiveness.</UTT>Did you know there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an NFL game?</UTT>I can believe it.  I played in HS and there was a lot of standing around.  Injuries really hurt the game like that of T Y Hilton who got pretty banged up by the Texans.</UTT>Yeah, I was unaware that the NFL uses chips to track the players during the game, did you know that?</UTT>I heard about that.  They are putting chips in everything now. Do you like Drew Brees?  He thinks every number has a purpose when it comes to exercise.</UTT>Interesting, this is the Saints QB?</UTT>Yep.  He's a dude even though the NFL has no rule against women playing.  Sorry Drew...</UTT>Interesting. I also know that the NFL has only one left handed quarterback these days. Did you?</UTT>Yeah, it's nothing like baseball pitchers... Funny, the Bills have tied the Pats in Superbowl losses.</UTT>I can believe that, they were in a lot of super bowls when I was younger.</UTT>Did ya know the circular huddle originated because the QB was deaf?  I thought it was to facilitate communication (verbal).</UTT>No, I didn't know that, was it to hide the hand signals.</UTT>Yeah.  Back to your point of the NFL in decline.  There is actually a QB that's considering giving up football to go to competitive gaming.  Our heroes of the future?</UTT>Interesting, twitch is a pretty popular website, it wouldn't surprise me.</UTT>Thanks for the chat!</UTT>1

hey there did you know that JFK was one of the wealthiest US presidents?</UTT>No, I did not know though... I did know George Washington was one as well.  I wonder where JFK got all his money from... I mean, what type of business his family was into..</UTT>right, I would like to know that too, I know Washington and Jefferson had slaves, I dont' know what JFK did</UTT>Lots of neat facts about the Presidents floating around... did you know that up until 1805 the runner up in the election became Vice President?  Can only imagine all the tension THAT would have created...</UTT>Haha that would be wild with President Trump and VP Hillary, talk about drama and dysfunction!</UTT>Oh, they'd be going at it like cats and dogs!  Might make for some fun interviews though.  LOL.  Speaking of presidents, did you know the President of Indonesia release THREE pop albums while in office?</UTT>wow that is impressive, I always said Trump and Hillary should release an album to heal the political wounds and then donate the money to chartiy!</UTT>I just can't imagine either of those two singing.  Heck, can't really imagine any president from the past few years singing.  Although I've heard some impersonators do some funny impressions of Bill Clinton singing.. Hehe.</UTT>haha ya and at least he does play the Saxophone so he could participate still haha</UTT>Now this is weird, thy say the president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana.  I'm not sure if that's as in "top banana" or if "banana" means something else over there, but I thought that was interesting...</UTT>I think I looked it up and his actual last name is Banana, so ya theres that.</UTT>ahhh well that makes sense.  Still, I like my "Top Banana" theory!  Lol.  Speaking of politics, did you know the Senate has the same gavel for 165 years?  Now that thing was built to last!</UTT>haha well ya they had the same gavel until Nixon cracked it, bad omen!</UTT>Wonder if he just banged it a bit too hard or if he was angry about something.  Nixon strikes me as a guy who got annoyed with things a lot... hehe.</UTT>haha ya he definitely has a tempor on him, very dumb that women couldn't wear pants in teh senate until 1993 too</UTT>Yeah, I heard they staged a protest to get that changed.  I guess it's a good thing, otherwise Hillary's wouldn't be able to wear her favorited pantsuits!  Hehe</UTT>lol that funny, and ya good on Mikulski and Braun, that took courage to do the protest I'm sure</UTT>They say the Senate has a tradition of a candy desk. Any Senator sitting near a busy entrance has to keep a drawer full of candy.  That'd be worth being a Senator for, right there!</UTT>that makes me hungry! and apparently all candy is from Pennsylvania! mmmmm chocolate haha</UTT>Now, here's a weird one, did you know it took the Secret Service four DAYS to realize bullets had been fired at the White House on November 11, 2011?  Granted, those things can travel pretty far, but still...</UTT>wow that is very wild! You'd think they'd be on the ball with that! GWB put solar panels on the white house btw</UTT>1

Hello do you like the radio?</UTT>Yea, I'm a big fan of am radio.It's pretty cool there's a website that streams all the classical radio dramas for free</UTT>Yeah that is cool,  have you had a chance to check it out?</UTT>Not not yet although I have some very old christian radio dramas on am radio once at like 2am</UTT>Thats cool. I hear jupiter storms can be heard on the radio</UTT>I did too, I wonder what AM station you have to tune to to pick up Jupiter's radio storms</UTT>I have no clue,  I was hoping you would know lol</UTT>I'll have to google it. It's pretty funny canadian radio by law has to play 40% of its songs by Canadian artists</UTT>Thats very patriotic of them!  Do you like animals?</UTT>Yea, animals are cool, crazy ther are over 1.5 million living species on earth</UTT>That is crazy!  Over 20 quintillion animals,  how many zeroes are in a quintillion lol</UTT>No clue but it's scary that most of those animals are insects</UTT>Ugh,  Have you ever watched naked and afraid?  they always get eaten by a million mosquitos on the first night,  it looks annoying and its on tv lol</UTT>yea, if I was Germany I would exclude insects from their constitutionally guaranteed legal rights for animals</UTT>Lol i agree!  In scotland the loch ness monster is a protected species.  Do you believe it exists?</UTT>No but I wish the Loch Ness monster did, I guess either way it's a good thing it's protected just in case</UTT>Did you know that there is a planet that shards of glass precipitate?</UTT>Sounds terrifying, so does Venus' lack of seasons</UTT>Sounds cold lol</UTT>Depends on if Venus is facing the sun, it's either brutally cold or incredibly hot</UTT>Oh right.</UTT>well I have to go, nice chatting with you</UTT>1

Hey there do you use Facebook? What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg?</UTT>I think that he is a dude who is in charge of a massively different product that he anticipated</UTT>Yeah I could see that. I also never knew that he was colorblind and that is the reason that Facebook is blue</UTT>thats an interesting factoid.</UTT>Did you know that Iceland is writing their constitution on Facebook. People can make suggestions and also alter it on the Facebook page.</UTT>that is an interesting way to keep a living document. do they have age restrictions because you can be 13 and be on facebook legally.</UTT>That's a great point. We don't want people putting fortnite or something like a video game into the Constitution. did you hear about the Facebook promotion with Burger King?</UTT>their paid content can be out of hand. I usually ignore the ads.</UTT>I do too. What would happen is that if you unfriended 10 people on Facebook, then you'll get a free Whopper. Also the person you unfriended would be alerted to this unfriending and that they were only worth one tenth of a Whopper haha</UTT>thats funny. I would totes unfriend people for a whopper. i like whoppers way more than I like people.</UTT>I would do that too. I wish I could do that right now and get some food I'm starving haha. What's crazy is that Facebook is valued at over 104 billion dollars. That could buy a lot of Whoppers!</UTT>I would use some of that billions for the Hershey pie too though.</UTT>Yeah I could see that too. Now what about Netflix do you watch Netflix at all?</UTT>heck yeah. I think its crazy that blockbuster didn't take them seriously.</UTT>Nope Blockbuster definitely made a big mistake there. Chance to buy them for 50 million and now Netflix is worth over 2 billion. Very sad</UTT>i thought it was cool that they track illegal downloads to know what titles to have.</UTT>I think that's a good strategy actually. I think it's funny that Netflix was started because the guy had a late copy of Apollo 13. That's a solid movie</UTT>I think i fell asleep when i watched it. i'm glad that they have so many movies with good rotten tomatoes ratings.</UTT>Yep that makes life easy for me haha very crazy that Netflix makes up about one-third of all bandwidth in North America. That is an insane amount</UTT>it is wild how much it is watched compared to traditional tv.</UTT>Oh I agree with you. I personally don't even watch normal TV I only watch Netflix at this point</UTT>1

I also never knew that he was colorblind and that is the reason that Facebook is blue</UTT>I think i fell asleep when i watched it. i'm glad that they have so many movies with good rotten tomatoes ratings.</UTT>I think that he is a dude who is in charge of a massively different product that he anticipated</UTT>pleased to meet you guy of a younger age . i am a leather wearing spiky haired gal</UTT>Did you know that Iceland is writing their constitution on Facebook. People can make suggestions and also alter it on the Facebook page.</UTT>i thought it was cool that they track illegal downloads to know what titles to have.</UTT>That's a great point. We don't want people putting fortnite or something like a video game into the Constitution. did you hear about the Facebook promotion with Burger King?</UTT>I would do that too. I wish I could do that right now and get some food I'm starving haha. What's crazy is that Facebook is valued at over 104 billion dollars. That could buy a lot of Whoppers!</UTT>that is an interesting way to keep a living document. do they have age restrictions because you can be 13 and be on facebook legally.</UTT>I would use some of that billions for the Hershey pie too though.</UTT>Hey there do you use Facebook? What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg?</UTT>heck yeah. I think its crazy that blockbuster didn't take them seriously.</UTT>I think that's a good strategy actually. I think it's funny that Netflix was started because the guy had a late copy of Apollo 13. That's a solid movie</UTT>their paid content can be out of hand. I usually ignore the ads.</UTT>Yeah I could see that too. Now what about Netflix do you watch Netflix at all?</UTT>Oh I agree with you. I personally don't even watch normal TV I only watch Netflix at this point</UTT>0
Are you familiar with theater?</UTT>I actually am. do you like shakespeare and his plays?</UTT>Neat. I like Shakespeare as far as his words. I had no idea one could be so accomplished and win so many awards within theater? This guy in article Section 3 has won eight awards acting in theater. Amazing.</UTT>neat, good for him for managind to do that. did you know shakespeare and pocahontas lived at the same time</UTT>That's an awesome fact. They apparently only died a year apart as well. Shakespeare also invented names: Miranda, Jessica and Olivia.</UTT>that is so cool. did you know he intentionally made grammar errors?</UTT>He was such a genius. His plays have been translated into every major living language, and apparently are performed more than any other. Amazing.</UTT>he was just amazing overall. he did that to get the attention of his audience</UTT>Agreed. I had no idea he was married. He married, Anne Hathaway and also had three children. The man certainly lived a life.</UTT>for sure. there are 33 shakespeare gardens in the world</UTT>Fascinating. I am from an area that has a Shakespeare Festival every year. It's amazing. A real human skull was used in a few performances of Hamlet, how crazy,</UTT>yeah do you know who the skull belonged to?</UTT>Andre Tchaikowsky, a Polish composer. He donated it so it could be used that way.</UTT>yeah, good thing is that his wish was granted</UTT>Yeah, I find it fascinating. Apparently Shakespeare has coined a variety of terms and phrases we use today; "laughing stock, good riddance, brave new world." The man changed culture with words…</UTT>he did for sure. do you ever watch the academy awards?</UTT>Never. I hear about them. I feel like the 24 awards are a generic way to praise someone.</UTT>yeah and they were even nominated for 9 emmys</UTT>Who was nominated for 9 Emmy's?</UTT>the oscars. i don't even know in what category.</UTT>Weird...... I honestly had no idea there where so many different institutions with award ceremonies.</UTT>yeah me either. nice chat</UTT>1

Hi! Do you ever watch soccer?</UTT>You mean football!! Yes I love it.</UTT>Haha, sorry, football it is! Just didn't want to get confused between the types. Do you have a favorite team?</UTT>I really don't, I just get into it for the World Cup. Fair Weather fan I guess. Haha</UTT>Can't blame you. The World Cup is really exciting, and it's about the only time I watch too. Sometimes I root for a team just for the hype though.</UTT>You can not go wrong With Mexico or Brazil. Did you know That the US placed in the first World Cup in 1930</UTT>I didn't know that! I have heard that the US women's World Cup team is pretty stellar, though.</UTT>Football (soccer)is the most popular sport in the world played in more than 200 countries. I was in Thailand and they have no idea what american football is, haha</UTT>It's amazing how far-reaching the sport is. I don't think there's a single other sport that has an international audience in the same way.</UTT>with 250 million players that is definitely hard to beat</UTT>I wonder if they count junior players in that 250 million. If they did, then I was one of the count as a kid!</UTT>I never played, I have a nephew that plays he loves it, Have you ever heard of the 3 team matches?</UTT>Three team matches? I can't imagine how that would work. It sounds complicated, and it doesn't sound like it would work on the standard rectangular pitch.</UTT>I am not sure exactly, But it would be fun to watch!</UTT>I'd love to see some top FIFA teams try playing that way. They practice so much for the normal game, it would be interesting to see them adapt to a new field.</UTT>I had gone to a game last year in The stadium that the Patriots play in. It was a great time.</UTT>Is there an association football team called the Patriots too? I'd only ever heard of the American football team, and I didn't think the stadiums could be used for both.</UTT>Yeah the New England Patriots football team, Their Stadium is also the home of the New England Revolution of Major Soccer League.</UTT>I had no idea! It's cool that they share a name like that. What team did you get to see them play against?</UTT>I do not remember, to be honest.</UTT>No worries. Sometimes sports is so exciting and full of energy that the details slip my mind too!</UTT>1

Hey are you a fan of Brent Cobb?</UTT>I'm not sure who he is, actually. Could you tell me how I should know of him?</UTT>He's a country singer/songwriter. His shyness almost prevented him from reaching stardom.</UTT>Oh, yes, I've heard of him. He's from Georgia, right?</UTT>Yeah, Ellaville, GA. He grew up in a musical family so music is in his blood.</UTT>I wonder if he collected his family albums. Do you still have any physical albums, or is everyone all online now?</UTT>If I have any albums they are CDs from the 90s and probably lost in an attic or basement. What about you?</UTT>I still collect vinyl records. I'd love a copy of Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl. It was still one of the best selling albums a few years ago even though it was recorded over 40 years ago.</UTT>That's a good album. Kind of interesting that Linkin Park has the best-selling album in the 21st century though I don't think they compare to Pink Floyd</UTT>Definitely. It surprising how long cassettes lasted compared to the CD.</UTT>I guess there was more advancement in technology around the time CDs were out. Are you a fan of NWA?</UTT>Heck yeah. Straight Outta Compton is a classic that never got a lot of radio play.</UTT>Strange considering how popular it was/is. That was the first album to reach platinum status without support from radio play or a major tour.</UTT>Well, I doubt they were played much in Canada. They have a law that 40% of radio played is from a Canadian artist.</UTT>They probably play Drake 95% of the time. Radios are quite an interesting invention huh? Yet nowadays they seem pretty simple from a surface level.</UTT>Did you know that Jupiter as storms so strong they can be heard from an AM radio?</UTT>I think I heard that from somewhere before. I do know that WW2 soldiers created "foxhole radios" by simply using a razorblade and pencil as a diode.</UTT>That's nuts. I wonder if they could pick up storms on Jupiter.</UTT>Well back then if they did hear storms from Jupiter they probably didn't know it and thought their radios were busted haha</UTT>Well, it was only WW2. People knew Jupiter existed in the 1940s.</UTT>I wonder if they had the knowledge or technology back then to identify whether a radio signal was from jupiter</UTT>Oh, maybe not. Though radio has been around for like, a hundred years.</UTT>1

Have you ever listened to radio dramas?  It sounds so interesting.  I heard there's a website where you can listen for free.  Need to research that.</UTT>Heck yeah. Straight Outta Compton is a classic that never got a lot of radio play.</UTT>Oh, yes, I've heard of him. He's from Georgia, right?</UTT>I wonder if he collected his family albums.

Do you know the sunset color on mars?</UTT>Isn't it blue or something?</UTT>Yes, I heard it is blue. I would like to see that!</UTT>I would too!

Did you know it is illegal to warm up your car in ohio?</UTT>I didn't know that! I wonder why? Do you know?</UTT>I guess there was to many thefts with the keys just sitting in empty cars.</UTT>Well that makes sense! Have you heard why Cadillac is named the way it is?</UTT>I have not? Do you know?</UTT>It was named after the founder of Detroit, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac!</UTT>That is a good name! Do you know the arrow next to the pump symbol on your dash board?</UTT>I did know that and am so happy I do haha! It was great chatting, have an awesome Friday!</UTT>1

Hey how are you doing, ever use the internet for stuff besides turkin it?</UTT>Oh yeah.  I look up stuff all the time like what is that 3 horizontal line icon called.  It's called a "hamburger".  Makes me hungry now.</UTT>Me too, I never knew the internet was a contraction of interconnected network, makes sense.</UTT>I just learned that recently too.  Did you know that there is a 3G cell service on the top of Mt. Everest?</UTT>I did not know, closer to the satelites right? haha</UTT>Or to order a pizza delivered after the climb? Do you read the full terms when you buy something off of internet?  Only 7% do...</UTT>I never have, that's a surprisingly high number, I wonder who is all reading them? Do you?</UTT>I wouldn't know.  I don't either.  I just keep making Bezos rich, unquestioned.  Wow, I didn't know IMDB was owned my Amazon.</UTT>Bezos is so rich he built a clock on a mountain that will run for 10,000 years, I wonder how accurate it will be then with the shifting daylight hours. That's pretty crazy about IMDB.</UTT>I know.  Trustbusters to the rescue!  His poor workers walk 7-15 miles each day on one shift.</UTT>Trust busters as in the anti-monopoly people? I would not mind seeing them around now a days.</UTT>Yeah, they've been lazy lately.  Funny, the 1st Amazon customer got a building named after him! I would rather have money...</UTT>Me too, but getting a building named after you for $27.95 is a pretty good deal too. I feel bad for those warehouse workers though, 7-15 miles a day and crappy pay and no insurance until recently.</UTT>Even the USPS makes deals with him to deliver on Sunday!  They would snub little ol' me for sure.</UTT>For sure, Ali Baba Group isn't too far behind them, ever order from them?</UTT>No but I've seen their stuff (I think).  Do you like country music? I can take it in small doses.</UTT>Not really a huge fan of it to be honest. Never knew George Strait and Bezos are cousins though, that's crazy.</UTT>I do like him.  I thought it was hilarious that Henry Ford helped bolster country music because he thought it was decadent. Something tells me he wouldn't be a fan of rap.</UTT>Haha, he would not have been. U2 was a huge country music fan too, they used to open for themselves playing country music.</UTT>I didn't know that.  I also didn't know the Fender Stratocaster (Strat) was intended for country music.  It's a rock icon now...</UTT>That is pretty crazy, I wonder what that would have sounded like in the 1970s with country music haha.</UTT>Maybe that's where rock really got it's kick?  Thanks for the great chat!</UTT>Great chatting with you too, have a great rest of the night!</UTT>1

Hi, how are you?</UTT>I am good.  The forecast for DC tonight is not too great - possibly snow</UTT>Yuck! We got a dusting today and I am pretty much done with winter. It can go away now. Do you like winter?</UTT>I am not a big fan of snow.   I like it that our forecast is going to end up in the 50's-60s</UTT>Im in chicago and I would like high 30s at this point. A week or two ago we had temps at -30!</UTT>Yeah I am not a polar vortex fan!  Chicago should move closer to the sun - a perfect sphere of hot plasma!</UTT>It's actually white too! I would have never guessed it!</UTT>It is about 109 times larger than earth - and about 330k heavier  - that is huge!</UTT>Yeah. But a lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun. That seems odd.</UTT>Wow that is pretty crazy.  Did you know that on mars the sunset is blue?  I wonder why that is</UTT>I had no idea. I bet it looks pretty. Neptune sure takes its time going around the sun!</UTT>How long does Neptune take?  I did not realize the sun rotates as well.</UTT>It completed its first full orbit in 2011 since it was in 1846!</UTT>Wow.  That is pretty nuts.  Just as nuts as a radio station that plays the sounds the sun makes!</UTT>It is the most important source of energy for life on earth! It deserves its own radio station!</UTT>No doubt it is important, but for many of us amazon seems almost as important.  I buy everything from food to books to toys there.</UTT>Were you their first customer?</UTT>No but that would have been cool because I would have had a building named after me</UTT>I would drive by it just to check in! I would also brag to all my friends. They would think I am obnoxious!</UTT>laugh.  I love amazon's logo - they really do have everything from a to z</UTT>They do! Nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

I buy everything from food to books to toys there.</UTT>I would drive by it just to check in! I would also brag to all my friends. They would think I am obnoxious!</UTT>I am not a big fan of snow.   I like it that our forecast is going to end up in the 50's-60s</UTT>They do! Nice chatting with you!</UTT>0
hi how are you doing tonight? are you a dog person?</UTT>Yes!  My dog is sleeping next to me now!</UTT>You are lucky. i wish i had a dog. cant manage one at the moment though.</UTT>When you can get one from shelter.  Best dog ever!  The dog is first animal to be domesticated.</UTT>Why a shelter? dont people pick ones of a certain breed with certain traits?</UTT>Save a life!  Though I feel like my dog saved me!  They vary in sizes and shapes for sure.</UTT>Oh, ok. i guess youre right. did you take your dog to obedience school?</UTT>Nope, already house trained, great with kids, very polite and loving!  No issues!   Dogs can learn over 1000 words!</UTT>Yes, but how will they do on the SAT? LOL. i know that dog are pretty clever at figuring things out too.</UTT>Yes very reward based.</UTT>I guess we all are to an extent. what do you think of google then?</UTT>Google?  I use it to research dogs, comedy or fantasy!</UTT>Yes, google is a dog company. they let emmployees bring dogs. that is great. dogs in the office make for a friendly atmosphere.</UTT>Oh wow, would love to bring dog to work.  Maybe the would have the eureka moments to solve a problem for Google lol.</UTT>Yeah, they could be good at testing. "What is it, Lassie? Is there something wrong with the server code?"</UTT>I would not be surprised if they are selectively bred to code!</UTT>Yeah,thats right. Google would have some special group to breed "coder" dogs.LOL</UTT>They regard them highly in Russia.  There is a unknown dog tomb</UTT>I know the dogs in moscow learn how to ride the subway. i guess they know the good spots for food. LOL</UTT>Dogs have extra senses which make them useful for many roles other than companionship like police and military even</UTT>Yeah, they have some color vision too. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>I wanted to end by this...the other night I went outside at 2am to put out trash.  My dog sensed something and started growling.  She never growls.  Then a figure ran away from us!  Get a doggie!</UTT>Yes, will do! Good night!</UTT>Take care!</UTT>1

Hi, how are you?</UTT>I'm good, just getting ready to watch some basketball today. How about you?</UTT>That's cool, I'm going to try to catch some basketball games myself, today.  Who's your favorite player?</UTT>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is my all-time favorite. He was such a dominant dunker that he got it banned from college basketball for over a decade!</UTT>I like him too, his use of the dunk was epic and I can see why it got banned.  My favorite player is Lebron James.</UTT>I like Lebron too, I can't wait to see his "Space Jam" sequel.</UTT>Me either, my grandkids really liked the original Space Jam.</UTT>I really liked it too. Did you know that Physicist proved that shooting "granny style" is the absolute best technique to consistently make free throws, but NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid to them?</UTT>I had heard that and yes, it does look stupid, but I'd do it myself it it got some points scored.  Lol Do you remember when Air Jordans first came out and the NBA banned them?</UTT>I do, and he wore them anyways. Nike was willing to pay the fine each game.</UTT>Nike sure has lots of money to do that.  They also gave Lebron James $ 90 million in a deal after he turned down $10 million form Reebok a year earlier, because he said Nike or Adidas might offer him more.  King James was correct!</UTT>Indeed he was! Speaking of Reebok, Allen Iverson signed a lifetime deal with them in 2001 that pays him $800,000 a year until he reaches 55.</UTT>Wow, he was smart, also, because that deal pays him a final lump sum of $32,000,000 if I'm not mistaken.</UTT>That's right, he should be set if he's smart about his money. Another smart player is Tim Duncan, he sacrificed money and actually stayed in college for four years instead of going directly to the NBA.</UTT>Yes, that was very smart on his part.</UTT>Did you know that in 39 states in the US, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach? That's pretty wild!</UTT>Yes, it is.  Did you know the US supreme court has a court on the top floor known as the highest court in the land?</UTT>Oh wow, that's kind of neat. I wonder if they ever play any pickup games during a break?</UTT>Could you see Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her sneakers shooting granny style?  lol</UTT>I would pay to see that! lol</UTT>Me too, she's a beast!  Hope she's on the mend after her recent fall, though.  On a different note, did you know the New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed the Tall blacks?  Isn't that kind of racist, to you?</UTT>Yeah that is pretty racist. I don't think I would want to wear any of their memorabilia. Did you know that the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas history?</UTT>Me either very racist.  I don't know how they get away with that in 2019?  Anyway, I think it's very ironic about James Naismith, as the inventor he should have rigged the game of basketball to allow his teams to win.</UTT>It brings a new meaning to "beating you at your own game." lol</UTT>Haha, that's so true!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning.  I need to get to work, talk to you later, friend.</UTT>1

Hi Turker, are you a NFL fan, if yes, did you think the chief should had been in the Superbowl?</UTT>The NFL? The National Football League? I do not who the chiefs are. Is that a team?</UTT>Yes, the Kansas City Chiefs were one of the top undefeated team in nfl 2018.</UTT>Oh, and they were not the champions? I thought undefeated would make them the best. What happened?</UTT>I am pretty sure New England Patriots beat them which ever one disagree with the call by the referee.</UTT>Oh, ok. I guess the referees made a mistake, a controversial one that helped the Patriots? I guess that happens.</UTT>Yes, well I just thought I would get your opinion, but that over with now, what do you think about women in the NFL?</UTT>I think that women would not be powerful enought to play in the NFL. Women usually have their own leagues.</UTT>Yes, that's my opinion, maybe they should get a WNFL team and see how well that work.</UTT>I think that it would be a different game, maybe some rules would change, I don't know. There is a WNBA. I guess it could work.</UTT>Yes that's true, but I think their ratings are low, not too many people talk about the wnba.</UTT>True. I think that the women's games tend to be slower and not as aggressive.</UTT>Yes you are right, I like to see three pointer, slam dump and other complicated shooting, not just regular shooting.</UTT>I expect that women will want to join but I don't think the game can be balanced for them.</UTT>I wouldn't want to see the tackling if the NFL was co-ed</UTT>yeah I don't think I would like it</UTT>You are so right, do you believe the average NFL game has 11 minutes of live game play?</UTT>I think that 11 minutes is short, yet there are so many injuries. Very dangerous. that is why they get paid.</UTT>Yes that's true, but I still think playing time over 11 minutes, It take me about eleven minutes just to have a nice meal at my table. Eleven minutes isn't any time at all.</UTT>True. I guess they are paid to stand around and wait. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>It was nice chatting with you, I will read more about space.</UTT>1

Sean Hannity had an awkward moment, and his quoting of Braking Bad made him look really bad</UTT>LOL... yeah right!  But i don't think he was quoting breaking bad was he?  I think they were comparing his quote to a scene in Breaking Bad?</UTT>Well it sure was similar to the series lol, maybe he didnt do it with the intentioin but it was almost the same as the shady scene with Saul and the $10 bucks.</UTT>Yeah, of course! I wonder how Sean felt after he said it and realized what he said?</UTT>I bet he felt pretty bad, he did tried to justify himself but he already made a huge mistake and lets face it Cohen is a really shady lawyer.</UTT>At least he Hannety didn't go to the lengths like white and pinkman did taking Saul out to the desert?  LOL</UTT>I agree lol although he still has time for sure. What a good series Breaking Bad was! I used to love that show</UTT>Yeah for sure... many of late nights binge watching Breaking Bad!    Just crazy how Sean thought he never retained Cohen!</UTT>Someone should give Sean some serious advices lol I thought the critics were harsh on him but at the same time funy, like the one that says dude needs to lay off Breaking Bad.</UTT>I thought advice is what he was seeking from Cohen?  Hahahahahaaaaaaaa</UTT>Lol, yeah apparently he should change counsel well with all that he said he will definetely do that.</UTT>Seriously... a Donkey Kong scandal... UGH!!!</UTT>Yeah, so I just heard about this scandal on the radio, do you like listening to the radio?</UTT>I listen to Sirius radio.  Do you?</UTT>Me too, on the way to work, you know Jupiter has rario storms that can be picked up by an AM radio</UTT>That's cool, I wonder what it sounds like?</UTT>Im guessing just about any other AM radio, would be interesting to listen but boring after a while</UTT>This is true!  That's too funny that in canada 40% of music has to be canadian.  You imagine that law in the US... people would revolt!</UTT>Yeah, people revolt for less so I can imgine it for sure lol, and I think its a great law, supports local talent</UTT>I totally agree.. but you could never get away with it!</UTT>Yeah I guess your right, there is a site with thousands of drama episodes and all for free you should really look this website up.</UTT>1

Hello, do you know kim kardashian?</UTT>I am aware of that person but could tell you little else about her.</UTT>Apparently,  she used to be Paris Hiltons personal assistant.</UTT>She must have learnt everything she know from Paris.  I'm a little vague on what it is she does right now.</UTT>I am not sure as well.  Her family has a show keeping up with the kardashians and she is married to kanye west.  She might not do anything really.</UTT>Do you think they both purposefully went the route they did to get famous on purpose?</UTT>lol probably.  Anything to get famous I guess.  It's really sickening that her family and herself have had so much fortune and success and it seems like they dont do anything.  I have never seen their show or bought any of their products,  I dont want to contribute money to them.</UTT>You and me are on the same page here.  The whole reality TV thing is scrapping the bottom of the barrel.  Have you heard of the Bad Girls Club show?</UTT>No I never heard of it.  Another reality show,  rewarding bad behavior?  lol</UTT>I don't really get what the point of the show was other than to show some women being mean to each other.</UTT>Sounds dumb lol I dont know why shows like that make so much money,  something is wrong with america lol I understand if its actors and fiction like a show or movie,  but these producers are encouraging these women to talk about each other,  ridiculous.</UTT>On these shows people just go over the top to get screen time.  They don't really act that way, but everyone has to out do the other and be more shocking.  The more shocking you are the better.</UTT>Yeah,  Ive seen like a documentary on it,  the producers encourage them to act like that.</UTT>So I guess one of these people went too far and starting committing crimes.  Stealing a dead man's identity!</UTT>Oh that,  yes I recently read about it.</UTT>My understanding is that she acted as an escort, and when the guy died from an overdose she kept his debit cards and used them for her own means after his death.</UTT>Yeah,  pretty scandalous!  Geez I cant believe what some people will do.</UTT>I think we should forget about these people.  Here's something positive instead, UNICEF will donate a day of clean water for each minute you don't use your phone.  That feels better.</UTT>Thats amazing!  I hope that I contribute to that,  I dont really use my phone that often lol Definitely a positive story!</UTT>I just wonder how they would monitor it, I suppose it would have to be on the honor system?</UTT>hmm not sure.  its been great chatting though,  have a good one.</UTT>1

Are you into rap? I don't know much about the genre.</UTT>No. I don't like it. I think it is cool that the origins of rap are from West Africa.</UTT>I'm not surprised that the genre made its way from Africa to the US. And now it's moving from the US around the world, in every language.</UTT>Yes. It seems to be going everywhere, even Tupac's music made into the Library of Congress.</UTT>I heard that Tupac danced ballet in high school. I would have expected him to be a dancer, but not that kind. The guy was really talented.</UTT>I really would not have expected it either but many singers are multitalented-like J Lo, they do movies. Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. Go figure.</UTT>Speaking of soundtracks, the one for the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" has gone multi-platinum.</UTT>Wow, I didn't know that. I've seen that movie and it deserves some attention. Did you know that Bruce Lee was also a great dancer?</UTT>Yeah, I heard that he was good. Didn't he win a contest in Hong Kong? Probably being good at dance helps with martial arts and vice versa.</UTT>Yes he did win the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958.</UTT>I wonder how old he was. I know that babies respond to music by dancing. It's an instinct and yet I can't dance at all.</UTT>Yes and babies smile more when they hit the beat. :]</UTT>I guess classical music isn't so good for babies when they want to dance! Have you heard of Daft Punk?</UTT>They sound vaguely familiar. What soundtrack or movie did they do?</UTT>They wear robot helmets. They did the Tron Legacy soundtrack.</UTT>I haven't seen Tron Legacy. Do you remember when Phil Collins did the Tarzan soundtrack?</UTT>I never saw Tarzan. Is that an animated feature?</UTT>Yes, it is. It is a Disney movie circa 1999. Very good movie. Did you know that Phil Collins recorded that soundtrack in 6 different languages?</UTT>Wow! I guess he has a good ear for language. I should check out Tarzan, the English version of course.</UTT>Yes, it is funny if you are a Disney fan. Say, did you see Michael Jackson do the "exteme lean" in some of his dance moves. I wonder how he did it.</UTT>He copied it from someone else who had used special shoes to lock into bolt heads in the stage floor.</UTT>1

Hi, are you an Ariana Grande Fan?</UTT>I am not but I do not hate her. What about you?</UTT>I had no opinion on her, but feel somewhat negative towards her after her accusation of another singer using bots to boost ratings.</UTT>I am a 40 year old male and feel I have lost all touch of modern music. I am not proud of that but it is reinforced every year I watch the VMAs.</UTT>That is fair, Ariana definitely seems to be solidly a modern artist like you said, especially in a culture where being on top of the charts seems to be more important than anything.</UTT>So who is your favorite artist?</UTT>My favorite artist is Kanye West, who ironically enough is also represented by Ariana's agent. What about yourself?</UTT>I have been into jazz recently. I have found a lot of contemparary artists that have kept me happy.</UTT>That's fair, it's certainly a more artistic music form. Do you ever listen to rap?</UTT>I do once in a while. I couldn't stop listening to Kendrick Lamar's latest when it came out.</UTT>True, I think he's very talented. In general rap is a very historied genre. Did you know Tupac's music is in the Library of Congress?</UTT>No, I didn't know that. I did know that The world's fastest english language rapper, noclue, can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second.</UTT>That's very impressive for sure. Rap is also intresting to me because of controversy. For example, Eminem was tried, and the judge even delivered her ruling in the form of a rap.</UTT>Donald glover got his rapper name 'childish gambino' from an online wu-tang clan name generator. What would yours be?</UTT>I'm not sure, but that's interesting, lot of rappers get influence from seemingly random sources. I know Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist before rapping.</UTT>Jason paige the singer of the pokemon theme is also the rapper on "black and white" by michael jackson. Thats so weird!</UTT>It's amazing how many side ventures artists get into! Busta Rhymes also voiced a character in the Rugrats movie, aside from rapping.</UTT>I remember that. There is a deaf rapper named signmark who rhymes in sign language.</UTT>That's very interesting, I'm sure a show would be fun to watch. Do you see movies often?</UTT>Not really... you?</UTT>Somewhat! In general I find the box office interesting, I didn't know Tom Hanks was the highest all-time box office star.</UTT>Nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

Hey there. You ever ride horses? I have in the past. I have also seen a Lipizzaner show, they give the classical dressage performances.</UTT>I have never had the chance to ride a horse. It looks fun. What is Lipizzaner?</UTT>You should try! It is a show performance horse! Very pretty. Icelandic horses have a fifth speed called tolt, but most horses have 4 speeds.</UTT>Four speeds? I didn't know that. I guess each speed is for a different purpose.</UTT>Yeah exactly. Clint Eastwood rode a lot of horses in his movies but he ended up being allergic to them! That would make riding tough.</UTT>I wonder how that happened. I guess the immune system gets confused.</UTT>Yeah it's odd how allergies can be developed at anytime. Dalmations are associated with fire fighters because apparently they would calm and protect the horses back in the day!</UTT>I guess with the noise and the flames, the horses could become nervous. The dogs probably were probably calm and helped the horses become calm.</UTT>Yeah good point. Do you use google very often? A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon!</UTT>I use Google. I guess that power could come in handy when I go to the Moon next.</UTT>Haha yes I would love to go to the moon too. At the google headquarters they use live goats to trim their lawn!</UTT>If the goats get stock options, sign me up. I can eat grass. I'm not proud.</UTT>Haha. Well you will never starve that's for sure. Do you have an android? Google maps calculates traffic by how fast android devices are moving.</UTT>I don't like that google tracks everything. Where I am, what I'm searching for.</UTT>Yeah they don't have the word privacy in their dictionary. They are powerful though. When there is a disputed border google maps tailors its maps to claims of each country.</UTT>I guess that is helpful for border disputes. I would like them to think about the little guy, the individual.</UTT>Yeah me too. It seems like they just care about making money. Do you like dancing? I don't very much but Bruce Lee was apparently a great dancer and was a champion dancer in 1958.</UTT>I bet he was! Tremendous body control. I guess he also had a sense of rhythm. A real ladies' man.</UTT>Yeah no doubt all the ladies loved him! I always wonder how Michael Jackson was able to do that lean move. Apparently he has a patent on the device which allowed him to do it (RIP Michael).</UTT>Those shoes were really cool. He knew how to pull off an illusion.</UTT>That's for sure. Tupac was also a ballet dancer in high school. I never would have guessed that because he never rapped about it!</UTT>He probably didn't want that fact getting out. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!</UTT>You as well! Even babies can dance lol. Have a good day!</UTT>1

do you like horror films? I guess Stephen King considers Bambi to be a horror movie, I never would have guessed that!</UTT>Hello there, really? I wonder why he would have ever said that.</UTT>ya, have you seen it? Like it's sad but not a horror movie to me, more like a sad one though haha</UTT>I think I have but when I was really young.  Do you know how they make the majority of metallic noises in horror movies?</UTT>haha no I don't how do they do it? some kind of weird instrument?</UTT>Yeah I guess it is called a waterphone.  Sounds like a pretty crazy instrument to me.</UTT>ya I need to look up what that sounds like, also I shoudl watch more horror movies apparently you can burn almost 200 calores from watching one, that would help me lose weight!</UTT>Yeah I guess they must get your heart racing pretty fast!  What are some of your horror favorites?</UTT>Well I like The Shining, I like Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween is a classic, what about you?</UTT>Yeah good call, the Shining is one of the best ever.  Halloween is a good one too and so is Nightmare.  I really like Rosemary's Baby, have you seen that one?</UTT>no I haven't, what is that about? I have heard of it but I haven't seen it yet</UTT>It is really good, it is about a wife who gets set up by her husband and she gives birth to the devil basically.</UTT>haha oh wow, well you like the shinning, its good to know that Danny from the movie didn't realize he was making a horror movie at the time, that could have scarred him for life!</UTT>Yeah I think that is pretty funny though.  I wonder what kind of movie he thought he was gettin into?</UTT>haha ya I wonder if they shot the scenes out of order or told him lies to keep it so he didn't know what he was diong haha</UTT>Yeah I think you might be right about that. On a different note, are you a user of Amazon?</UTT>ya I like to buy stuff from there, I don't have prime anymore i didn't use it enough, what about you?</UTT>Yeah I use them quite often, especially around the holidays.  Do you know what the first ever amazon purchase was?</UTT>no I don't! I do know the guy would bought the first item got a building named after him though, what was it?</UTT>Yeah good call! I guess he paid $27.95 and got a building named after him yeah.</UTT>I mean it is cool to get a building named after you, but it would have been cooler to get something physical, really anything, instead of that haha but thats just me</UTT>1

Do you like to read?</UTT>Yes, I love to read! Do you like to read?</UTT>I do when I have the chance. Luckily it's not the 18th century where there was a fear of the spread of reading of novels. It was a moral panic.</UTT>Isn't that scary! I'm glad its the modern times. I know getting free time to relax and read is hard to get some times.</UTT>Yeah, it is, but maybe I would have more time to read if I could speed read like Anne Jones, who can read 4700 words per minute.</UTT>I know that is unreal. How can you understand what you're reading at that speed?</UTT>I know, I wonder how they verified that she was actually reading. Perhaps comprehension questions?</UTT>Could be, that would be alot of them. Have you read the Ender's game book? I think there was a movie. I have not seen it though. Its on the read list from the military.</UTT>I have not read that. Starship troopers is also on the reading list of some military branches.</UTT>Yes, that looks like a good read.  I wonder why Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible?</UTT>I'm not sure. I wonder how he thought about kids learning the bible at school.</UTT>I don't know? Teddy Roosevelt and John Adams are the only two presidents that did not use the bible for swearing-in. I think they used the constitution instead.</UTT>Interesting! I wondered about Jefferson because before 63 it was not uncommon for students to be required to read the Bible as part of their elementary education.</UTT>That is interesting. Apple in latin is called malus.</UTT>I guess it means both apple and evil!</UTT>Yes, I didn't know that! Its good to know there is 3g cell service on the top of Mt Everest!</UTT>Ha, so I guess it is difficult to escape from technology. There is also a copy of the internet in case the internet burns down.</UTT>Yes, That's a good idea! I believe its true that only 7% of people read the full terms when buying a product.</UTT>Wow, I think I am one of them.</UTT>I am too, they make it so long and difficult to read. Who knows what's in there? Scary. Did you know the menu button is also called the hamburger button?</UTT>I have never heard of it being called that!</UTT>1

I always enjoy reading about people's idea of a dream day. Sometimes it gives me ideas of things to do.</UTT>That is an interesting article, so many things to do at the D.C area</UTT>Yeah, most of it didn't sound fun to me but the menu ideas sounded amazing.</UTT>I agree, have you been to the D.C area before?   I would like to go to the Natural History Mesuem, that seems like a great place</UTT>No, I never have. Never been east of the Mississippi. Have you been to DC?</UTT>I have been to D.C  I think its a great place, what would you like to do there?</UTT>Probably just check out all the standard touristy stuff LOL. I'd like to see the Library of Congress, but I'd wind up living on the streets there just to have continuing access to it. What did you do?</UTT>That doesnt sound like a fun activity lol, I would like to try one of those sweet caffeinated drinks</UTT>Yeah, I'm not sure what she was talking about because I never tried Starbucks tea. Sounded like ordering two drinks and mixing them together. Also the seafood sounded amazing -- especially the calamari.</UTT>Those dishes sound great, I would like to try them out as well, the cuisine in the area must be one of the best in the whole country</UTT>Probably. They say DC used to be a backwater compared to New York, but since it expanded so much after WWII it's probably a lot better.</UTT>it must be a lot better by now, so do you like fantasy?</UTT>Not really -- I like some of the usual children's fantasy lit that's popular among adult stoners like Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Graham LOL, but mostly sci-fi. How about you?</UTT>I do, I like fantasy movies and also games, a janitor from Chicago wrote a 15000 page fantasy manuscript!!</UTT>I wonder if it was any good.</UTT>I bet a few pages were, too bad it got discovered after his death</UTT>I should Google to find out more about it. It would be nice if it got published.</UTT>Maybe it is, who knows movies might be inspired in his masterpiece, 15000 pages is a lot,</UTT>Yeah, that's not a "novel" -- it's a whole series!</UTT>Yeah a whole series I agree, he must had invested a lot of time in it</UTT>Must've been his secret life away from work. Nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

hELLO</UTT>Hi there!</UTT>Did you know that on april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead.</UTT>Really, wow! I wonder how many people had TV then?</UTT>Good question.  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude</UTT>cool! ever hears of Eurovision?</UTT>No, what's that?</UTT>Song Contest in england.</UTT>Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano</UTT>neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle.</UTT>An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds.</UTT>Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years.</UTT>When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for "beat it" he literally set the studio speakers on fire.</UTT>Oh my gosh! DO you like Jazz?</UTT>No, not really.  You?</UTT>Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans.</UTT>There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.</UTT>I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression,</UTT>A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by.</UTT>Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.</UTT>Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.</UTT>Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby.</UTT>Clint Eastwood movies are awesome</UTT>they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave?</UTT>That's great one.  Unforgiven was awesome</UTT>I'll have to look that one up! Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing.</UTT>I didn't realize that.  That's very interesting.  Thanks for the chat.</UTT>You too! Have a good day!</UTT>Thanks have a great day as well</UTT>Matthew bellamy from the band muse holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed on a tour.</UTT>1

DO you like Jazz?</UTT>cool! ever hears of Eurovision?</UTT>Hi there!</UTT>Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby.</UTT>When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for "beat it" he literally set the studio speakers on fire.</UTT>No, what's that?</UTT>Matthew bellamy from the band muse holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed on a tour.</UTT>I'll have to look that one up! Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing.</UTT>Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans.</UTT>You too! Have a good day!</UTT>0
Do you like drama?</UTT>I sure do. Have you seen House MD?</UTT>Yes , Laurie made $700 000 per episode in there</UTT>Yeah. Do you like Jim Carrey?</UTT>I do. Did you know he does not do dramas anymore?</UTT>Yes because he thinks that they do no portray positivity</UTT>Yeah. Do you listen to radio dramas?</UTT>I do sometimes. There is a website where you can listen to them for free</UTT>Yeah. Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?</UTT>Yes he was chasing the pretty girls and they were in drama class</UTT>Yeah what a guy. Do you like Jon Hamm?</UTT>Yes he is so funny. He used to be a drama teacher in a high school once</UTT>Yes and one of his students was Ellie Kemper</UTT>Yeah small world. Do you use YouTube?</UTT>Yes all the time. It is the second largest search engine anyways</UTT>Yeah. Do you know which is the most disliked video in there?</UTT>Yes it is Baby by Justin Bieber, crazy.</UTT>I know. Do you know why they increased the view count?</UTT>Because Gangnam Style song became so popular</UTT>Yeah Have you heard of Bluetube?</UTT>Yes that is the police youtube pretty cool. Nice chat</UTT>1
Yes , Laurie made $700 000 per episode in there</UTT>yah.. beanie cap is wear on that one day only.</UTT>Yes he was chasing the pretty girls and they were in drama class</UTT>Yes it is Baby by Justin Bieber, crazy.</UTT>I know.

What do you think about the tweet the Russian Embassy posted?</UTT>It is kind of fun.  Emoji of a space ship and some photo.  Not serious at all.  Twitter is not meant to be serious.</UTT>Yeah I guess Twitter is informal but it can have serious repercussions still.</UTT>There are a lot of reasons for a helicopter to be around DC.  The DC police had one up for a possible robbery.  I guess it could be real event taken the wrong way. Serious it is.</UTT>It seems a bit too unrealistic to me lol like a Tom Clancy novel.</UTT>Yes, like a novel. Did you know that the Russian Foreign Ministry put a april fools joke on the answering machines... Press 3 to request election interference. Thats a good one.</UTT>It didnt sound like the Russian foreign ministry is full of surprises,</UTT>Oh Russians, always having fun.  Not like in the US where a cat named Hank was running in the Virginia Senate Election.  He got third.</UTT>Thats too bad I was cheering for Hank, probably would have done a better job than most politicians.</UTT>The cat would have been cool!  It is a odd thing how how we pick elected officials.  Apparently the faster blinking person has lost every presidential election since 1980.</UTT>I bet thats a signal our subconcious picks up, you know that the Iphone has more computing power than the us nuclear icbm detterrent all combined!!</UTT>I wonder how that can be.  It is no small feat to hit a moving target with a missile.  Let alone a few hundred targets.  I belive the Iphone thing.  There is little correlation between cellphone call quality and the bars of service.</UTT>I know I would have thought it required something a lot more powerful than an Iphone and I wonder why is that</UTT>I do not know.  Perhaps that rule that says computing power doubles and cost halves very year.  I have a fun piece of trivia about phones.  The dial phone was created because an business thought the operators were routing calls to competitors.</UTT>Oh how interesting, I have one for you too, do you know why the area code of New York is 212?</UTT>I would guess that the early idea was numbers like 313, 414.  NY was first, so 212.  In 1930's an actress helped invent cell phone wifi and gps.  way to go Hedy Lamarr.</UTT>No, the correct answer is because it was the fastest number to dial back when rotary phones were used.</UTT>Well, that sounds reasonable.  No idea why or how such things happen.  Kind of like the Hedy bit of trivia.</UTT>Yeah I guess its just  because of coincidences of life, kind of like why the guest house of the current president can be bigger then the White House.</UTT>The white house has some thick walls.  Ha.  Lincoln was the first president to have a photo taken for inauguration.  Want to know the freaky part?</UTT>Yes please tell me, I am intrigued!</UTT>In that Lincoln photo was John Wilkes Booth.  Always a bad sign when you have three names.</UTT>Oh, I bet Lincoln didnt know the guy next to him was going to eventually kill him.</UTT>1

Do you enjoy watching films or tv?</UTT>I love watching films but not so much tv</UTT>What genre do you enjoy? I like horror films</UTT>I do not like horror films.  I actually do watch some saturday night live.  i love the skits, but I miss the old school cast.</UTT>Unlike most genres, horror films are usually a hit or miss for me. I feel that horror is a very subjective thing</UTT>I understand what you mean about horror films.  I feel like momento was intended to be a horror film, but turned out to be an intellectual and interesting film not so much horror.  So I agree they are hit or miss.</UTT>Did you know in some films, the actors themselves didn't know they were performing in a horror movie?</UTT>I have read that, but I didn't know before reading the knowledge.  I also read that some movies were thought to be scary, but ended up being horror.  that seems crazy.</UTT>I mean I can see why stephen king would be terrified of bambi considering that if you don't gloss over that it is a disney film, it is quite dark</UTT>A lot of the disney movies are scary and dark.  The wicked stepmother who locks Cinderella up in the tower.</UTT>Well a lot of them are toned down versions of their german counterparts</UTT>Interesting.  I didn't know that.  Where did you learn that information?</UTT>I learned it in high school. For instance, since the stepsister's feet were too big to fit in the glass slipper, one girl cut her heel and the other her toe to fit</UTT>Wow.  That feels like a horror movie to me.  And so dark and depressing.  Thanks for telling me that.  I think I'll stick to my romcoms.</UTT>Well even though it is a bit dark, I think it is interesting to learn the origins of all the disney classic</UTT>I agree.  I just had no idea that was where that came from.  I feel like those could be categorized as a horror movie that wasn't supposed to originally be considered a horror movie.</UTT>True. Like I said, I feel most of what we consider to be horror movies are highly subjective</UTT>Have you seen any other horror movies as of late?  I feel like every other commercial is some crazy horror movie including kidnapping or some other craziness.  I recently saw a movie ad about an older woman who acts nice and then tortures people.  I think it was called Greta.</UTT>I saw the elevator. it is an old horror movie that was so bad it is better know as being hilarious</UTT>Well I try to steer clear of horror movies altogether.  I remember watching Halloween in high school and practically throwing up.  And that movie was so ridiculous.  So It's better for me to watch fluffy movies or dramatic movies.  Nice talking with you.</UTT>The same to you.</UTT>1

Hey do you think Kobe Bryant is going to play in the Big 3 League next year</UTT>I hear that he may now but I can't imagine that.</UTT>Yeah he's getting pretty old, I think he should just give it all up honestly. What do you think? also do you ever watch the NBA</UTT>You're probably right. I watch occasionally.</UTT>What's interesting to me is there is only one Canadian NBA team, I wonder why that is</UTT>I didn't realize there was one. I guess I didn't think about it being the National Basketball Association. If it's northern Canada that's a lot of travel for games.</UTT>That's true but if they have a demand for a team they should put a team up there somewhere, it's interesting that the NBA's located in New York-New York, I never knew that</UTT>I did not either. Are you familiar with Reggie Miller?</UTT>Yes I've heard of them. Wasn't his younger sister really good at basketball too? She would constantly beat the record that he set</UTT>She was. In high school she overshadowed him. She broke 8 national records!</UTT>Amazing! What do you think about Allen Iverson by the way he makes almost $800,000 every year from Reebok alone</UTT>I heard about that. And that's only until age 55 and then he gets a lump sum of $32,000,000!</UTT>Yep he's not going to any problems with money. What do you think about shooting granny style by the way? If you want to pay me 32 million dollars I will definitely shoot granny style all night long LOL</UTT>I did hear that it's actually the most effective way to score points on the line. I would use the most effective method regardless of how it looks.</UTT>Yep I would too. What about Air Jordans have you ever worn those before? Apparently they were banned by the NBA initially</UTT>I have not. I do know that Jordan wore them anyway and Nike paid his fines. It seems to have worked out for them.</UTT>Yeah I think that was the right move. I don't think it was the right move for Tim Duncan to delay playing for the NBA though, he stayed in college to get his degree which cost him money</UTT>But thankfully he still got to play after so he got his education and a career in the NBA.</UTT>Well that is one way to look at it. How often do you use the internet by the way? Do you know what the hamburger button is</UTT>I use the internet constantly but I have never heard of a hamburger button. What is it?</UTT>Well it's a button that looks like three horizontal lines, normally it is used for menus, I think Reddit uses it actually</UTT>1

Hello,  do you know much about cinematography?</UTT>Not really, I'm an avid movie watcher. I have heard of Roger Deakins who constantly is getting nominated for awards.</UTT>Oh ok,  I havent heard of him. Thats great though,  hes been nomiated  times.</UTT>Do you like visiting D.C.?  They have over 250 restaurants and a Summer Restaurant Week.</UTT>I have never been there. I did read that recently.  Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography?</UTT>That will probably change soon.  I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was involved with Spartacus.</UTT>Me either.  do you like comedy?</UTT>Yes.  I can't believe the Green Lantern was going to be a comedy with Jack Black!</UTT>Yeah thats weird!  Not sure it woldve made it better though lol</UTT>Couldn't have hurt much. :) I was surprised to know that the Python programming language was, in part, named after Monty Python.</UTT>Yeah thought that might have been a coincidence.  I guess comedy central has not been doing great,  It has cancelled over  shows!</UTT>That or they're picky.  Bill Murray isn't so picky.  He thought the "Kung Fu Hustle" was super great.</UTT>It was a great movie!</UTT>I am an amatuer astonomer and Jupiter's moon Ganymede fascinates me since it is big enough to be a planet.</UTT>That is really big!</UTT>Another one is that Uranus is actually rotating on its side.  Many think it was involved in a major collision.</UTT>Oh thats interesting.  and the accident threw it off axis?  If it rotates on its side,  does that mean there is an area that doesnt get any sun?</UTT>Yeah, the sunlight is in weird time patterns on the poles. I guess the building blocks of life (e.g., RNA) have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away.</UTT>Do you know what planet it is where shards of glass rain sideways in 2000 degress fahrenheit?</UTT>I would guess one of the outer ice planets - probably Neptune.  Venus doesn't have seasons or that kind of wind.</UTT>interesting,  thanks.</UTT>Thank you.  You were a great chat partner.</UTT>1

Have you played any model of Playstation?</UTT>I used to play the original playstation. What about you?</UTT>I've played them all. I enjoy them. Playstation 3's are currently being used to research black holes. I wonder how that works?</UTT>I am not sure. Do you play often?</UTT>I do between my Playstation and XBox. Did you play the PS2 at all?</UTT>I think I had that one... I did not play much. Even in college I did not play a lot. I played a ton when I got my first job and moved in with my gaming friends. We played all the time. Left the bars early to play...</UTT>It is very fun. The last game for the PS2 was FIFA 14. It became the first game to span 3 console generations.</UTT>Wow, I had no idea! Seems like a good game to do that with. FIFA is crazy popular!</UTT>It definitely is. The department of defense also used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer. They are finding all kinds of uses for consoles.</UTT>That's crazy! PS2 is the best selling consoule to date. That just seems right.</UTT>I believe that is because it had a DVD player. It was the first DVD player for most people I know because there was not much of a price difference between it and a regular DVD player at the time.</UTT>One of my room mates bought a PS4 because it was also a blu ray player and he wanted a new blu ray. He also played that consoule all the time!</UTT>Makes sense. We use ours for a lot of media. Do you also watch a lot of television. I watch way too much.</UTT>I am trying to cut out uneccesary TV from my life. I still watch it but am choosing some more worthwhile endevours. What shows do you watch?</UTT>Lots. Currently binging The Punisher. Did you know there is only one episode of The Simpsons where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned?</UTT>I did. It is the 4 women and the manicure. Good episode. I heard they canceled the Punisher on Netflix.</UTT>I had not heard that yet but I'm positive it's going to happen because they are slowly cancelling all of the Marvel shows since the Disney merger. Another Simpsons fact, they sent flowers to the South Park crew when South Park aired it's Family Guy episode which is very funny.</UTT>Wow. Do you watch the family guy or south park? Do you enjoy cartoons?</UTT>Yes I watch both. But they were spot on with their criticism of Family Guy.</UTT>I did not watch that one. what was the criticism about?</UTT>How Family Guys jokes are basically a series of flashbacks and they ripped off The Simpsons for their format.</UTT>Oh... Nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

Hello,  how are you doing? Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.</UTT>Hello, I'm doing great. Have you ever watched the variation that has three teams, instead of two?</UTT>Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.</UTT>I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery.</UTT>Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it "soccer" because it was slang for association football</UTT>I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that.</UTT>Seems like a huge expense lol</UTT>I didn't know the rapper Drake, was Canadian, did you?</UTT>Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an "obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.</UTT>That's sweet, and it's interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED.</UTT>Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school.</UTT>Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem's verse.</UTT>Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive.</UTT>Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I've never heard of it.</UTT>I've heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?</UTT>I'm not sure, as I've never watched it, even though it was on for seven years.</UTT>The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.</UTT>That's funny, I bet he made their night. I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil' Wayne's label, instead of Dre's Death Row.</UTT>Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money</UTT>I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular.</UTT>me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you</UTT>1
Seems like a huge expense lol</UTT>I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery.</UTT>Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem's verse.</UTT>Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money</UTT>Hello, I'm doing great. Have you ever watched the variation that has three teams, instead of two?</UTT>Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an "obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.</UTT>Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.</UTT>Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it "soccer" because it was slang for association football</UTT>I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that.</UTT>I didn't know the rapper Drake, was Canadian, did you?</UTT>me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you</UTT>I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular.</UTT>Hello,  how are you doing? Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.</UTT>I'm not sure, as I've never watched it, even though it was on for seven years.</UTT>The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.</UTT>Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I've never heard of it.</UTT>That's sweet, and it's interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED.</UTT>Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive.</UTT>I've heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?</UTT>That's funny, I bet he made their night. I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil' Wayne's label, instead of Dre's Death Row.</UTT>that is great . i am not too active . i spend my free time writing .</UTT>0
Good morning!  Do you follow presidential history?</UTT>I don't know much but I find it very interesting, especially the crazy way elections used to work. Did you know that until the early 1800's the runner up in a US presidential election was appointed the vice president?! Awkward!</UTT>Could you imagine that happening now?  The top 3 wealthiest presidents in American history before Trump were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.</UTT>I wonder what the specific numbers on that are or how they compare with inflation. US presidents back int the day were usually all business men weren't they? Meanwhile the president of Indonesia is releasing pop albums haha</UTT>I think you are pretty correct - either businessmen or ex-military generals for the most part.  Makes you wonder what he got done in office if the Indonesian president had that much free time on his hand.   I like the name of the first president of Zimbabwe. They called him president Banana!</UTT>I wonder how president banana got that nickname. Do you think his name sounded like banana or that he really loved to eat them?</UTT>I'm thinking it probably sounded like it.  lol  Did you know that the US presidents guest house is larger than the white house?</UTT>That's so shocking to me! I would expect The White House will all the extra security and staff would be bigger. Maybe a smaller building is more secure?</UTT>That might be right.  I was wondering if maybe it was just to be more comfortable for visiting white house guests?</UTT>Do you think maybe white house guests are more used to staying in a palace or something enormous?</UTT>I'm sure they probably get treated top notch.  They're not staying at the Motel 6  LOL</UTT>I wonder if they have any special fun stuff in them, to accomodate the guests like a recording studio for the President of Indonesia</UTT>Hahaha Wouldn't that be funny?  Interesting piece of US senate history....the candy desk is a tradition of the US senate since 1968.  The desk is currently supplied by candy made in PA.</UTT>I've never even heard of this. Is it a lifesize  desk made of candy or a desk covered in candy?</UTT>It's a desk that the drawers are filled with candy.  I don't think they are as relevant as they used to be.  When I was a kid the secretary at my elementary school had a candy desk.</UTT>That's interesting is it there for visiting children or for the staff or what? I don't imagine there are quite as many tours of children going through the White House these days since the current president doesn't live there</UTT>I think they have it there more for show and a historical purpose type thing.  I seem to remember the candy desks going away at  schools in the early 80's when the generation that was into them started retiring.</UTT>It seems like the whole world has changed drastically since the late 80's. Did you know women weren't allowed to wear pants on the senate floor until 1993?</UTT>Yes!  I graduated in 89.  Seems like not much changed except the job economy has been a downhill slide since then.  I didn't know that!  What an odd law.</UTT>There's another weird senate law where the sergeant at arms can arrest absent senators and make them come to the chamber to vote. Once a guy tried to escape and they dragged him in by his feet! I hope the running was worth it to him!</UTT>LOL  That is a definitely a strange law.  I wonder how in the heck they came up with that?</UTT>My guess is that there was a run of low productivity and somebody got an aggressive bright idea haha</UTT>LOL That's funny!  I had fun chatting with you!  Hope you have an enjoyable day!</UTT>1

Hi do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Hello, yes I do actually. Did you know Bill Murray voice the human torch in the fantastic four radio show?</UTT>Cool did not know that If you turn the radio to AM you might catch Jupiter's storms</UTT>Neat, I would like to hear that. There is a radio station that can translate solar activity to sound</UTT>wow cool. Do you know what foxholes are?</UTT>Hmm I am not sure, Foxhole radios were something of the past, were they not?</UTT>Yeah they were. They were radios that soldiers made using razorblades and pencils during WWII</UTT>WOw I wonder how that works actually. A hanson song once became the most popular one because the DJ's did not reveal the band</UTT>that is very creative of them. Do you ever listen to Canadian radios?</UTT>Hmm not a lot but sometimes. How about you?</UTT>I do osmetimes only. Did you know they are required to play 40% Canadian music?</UTT>Wow they must really want to support their local singers. Good for them, they have some nice up and coming singers too</UTT>Yeah that is true. Do you ever listen to radio dramas?</UTT>I cannot say that I do actually. Did you know one of the most popular radio acts was a ventriloquist back in 1970s?</UTT>WOw did not know that. Well if you ever want to there is a channels that broadcasts them for free</UTT>Oh that is nice, free on top of that. Do you know much about the presidents?</UTT>Hm I know some stuff, like  in Guatemala close family of the president are not allowed to run too</UTT>That is interesting. THe only US president that has had a PhD was WIlson</UTT>Yeah I guess you do not need one after all. DO you know who the wealthiest presidents are in us history?</UTT>I do not think I know that actually. I know LIncoln was the first president that was photographed for his inaguration</UTT>That is neat. It is Jefferson, JFK and Washington as the wealthiest three</UTT>1
that is very creative of them. Do you ever listen to Canadian radios?</UTT>I agree.  A lot of the shark attacks seem to be the shark going after it's primary food source (seals) and getting confused.  I remember a group of swimmers and the slowest one in the pack got attacked.</UTT>Wow they must really want to support their local singers.

Do you watch baseball?</UTT>Hi! I love baseball! In fact, I also love soccer-baseball as they call it in Canada as well. Ha! What about you?</UTT>lol, I never knew that! I like watching baseball. Do you have a favorite team?</UTT>I like them all, really. So did you know baseball managers only wear uniforms because they can play for their team if needed? I'd love to see one of those old managers get out there and play. Ha!</UTT>That is awesome, I have seen it before on my old semi pro team I played on. The coach was 50 and we had too many hurt people lol</UTT>I bet that was a sight to see, wasn't it? Almost as fascinating as finding $3 million worth in 1900s baseball cards in your grandfather's attic like that one guy did. It must be nice!</UTT>Right! Talk about early retirement! Do you collect cards?</UTT>I should start, or at least check some attics. Ha! On a similar baseball note, can you believe the Japanese baseball fans were surprised to learn baseball is America's national pastime? The fact that it surprised them surprises me. Ha!</UTT>Right lol! I used to collect and had some good ones, never 3 milllion worth though! That surprises me too, how did they start the game since america invented it</UTT>I know, right? You'd think they would have known that! But then again, I didn't know until recently that a married couple scheduled all the 2430 games played for 24 years until 2005. That must have been a cool job!</UTT>I wonder how they got that job and why they shy'd away from it. That would be so fun!</UTT>Indeed it would! Can you imagine scheduling teams like the Cubs? That would be so cool. Speaking of the Cubs, it's shocking they haven't won a World Series since becoming the first baseball team to win back to back World Series'!</UTT>They won it a few years ago, but it took them like 100+ years to do it! Did you watch the world series this year?</UTT>I wasn't able to, sadly. I guess I'm part of the reason why the women's world cup had higher TV ratings in the US than the world series did.</UTT>me too lol! I followed it online mostly. did you hear how babe ruth lost the world series in 1926?</UTT>I did, actually! I heard he was caught stealing to end game 7 and his team was only down by one run. That had to have been so disappointing!</UTT>for sure, I am sure that is after they won a bunch of world series already, so probably showing off lol</UTT>Ha! Maybe so! But can you believe that the Marine corps carried the Canadian flag into the stadium upside down during the 1992 World Series? That's embarassing. Ha!</UTT>That would be so embarrassing lol, canada is too nice! It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>Indeed Canada is very nice! I personally think the entire planet would be nice if over 80% of the natural forests hadn't been destroyed. That's so heartbreaking! Well it was nice chatting with you as well! Hope you have a great day, friend!</UTT>You too! Enjoy your weekend!</UTT>1
Do you watch baseball?</UTT>Hi! I love baseball! In fact, I also love soccer-baseball as they call it in Canada as well. Ha! What about you?</UTT>Wonder how he went from having that degree to deciding, "Hey, you know what?  I think I'll play guitar in a band!"  Wonder if that's covered in that movie about Queen they just made...</UTT>I wasn't able to, sadly.

I might have to take a trip to the library to find out the exact number, but pretty sure not twelve blood types in humans.</UTT>It is very interesting.

I'm an Independent.</UTT>Oh cool, Im independent too!</UTT>The Republican party use to be very different.</UTT>Yes the GOP, Grand Old Party</UTT>Lincoln was a Republican</UTT>Did you know that every president with a beard has been republican?</UTT>I've read that. They must of all been hipsters. LOL</UTT>Also, the consistent use of red and blue only started in 2000</UTT>I know. It seems to have been like that forever.</UTT>Right!  Did you know the presidential guest house is bigger than the white house?</UTT>I've heard that. I have been to the White House when Clinton was in office.

Hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?</UTT>I heard it but I'm skeptical.  That sounds far too high and what's the definition of "natural.</UTT>Not sure in this case.  When the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long!</UTT>That was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava.  Bummer, they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century.</UTT>Yeah that would be crazy. If earths history was represented as a 24 hour period,  humans would only represent 1 min and 17 seconds lol Its sometimes so surprising how small we are in the universe.</UTT>Yeah, the sheer distances give me that feeling. The UN actually has an official ambassador to ETs.</UTT>I read that,  that just covinces me more that we are not alone.</UTT>I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013?  It took 40% of web traffic down.  I probably blamed my ISP.</UTT>That is crazy!  I bet people were so confused lol I dont remember it as well.</UTT>Wow, a single Google search requires more computing power than what it took to send Neil Armstrong and 11 others to the moon!</UTT>That is surprising!  Wow everytime I google search I could be sending someone to the moon instead lol</UTT>Ha.  I guess Google once used goats instead of people to mow the lawns.  I can't imagine what a hassle it would have been to manage all the goats.  They are mischievous creatures that eat EVERYTHING.</UTT>lol true,  thats the new thing in Caifornia now,  hiring goats to eat your lawn,  I see it everywhere,  I think its great as long as they are managed by someone lol</UTT>Recent readings have confirmed what I always suspected:  woman are more likely to own an iPhone.  I'm a dude and I've owned one.  Android now...</UTT>I had the iphone 4 a long time ago and now I have the android lol</UTT>It seems that with Apple, there are too many strings attached forcing you to use their stuff.</UTT>I know right,  all there stuff has to go together like you are hooked into buying everything they own.  Its really annoying</UTT>I guess that's why we went Android?  Funny Jobs switched iPhones during presentation because they would run out of power and RAM.</UTT>Lol right!  I love android its so simple.  Thats a fail lol it cant even last a presentation without running out of ram lol</UTT>I think the irreplaceable battery on iPhone hurt their market.  Funny Microsoft had funeral for the death of the iPhone when it launched their own line.</UTT>lol Nice!</UTT>I had a MS phone and it was really good but lack of available  SW kind of ruined it.</UTT>Sorry to hear.  its been great talking to you.</UTT>1
Hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?</UTT>That was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava.  Bummer, they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century.</UTT>Not sure in this case.  When the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long!</UTT>Lol right!  I love android its so simple.  Thats a fail lol it cant even last a presentation without running out of ram lol</UTT>Yeah that would be crazy. If earths history was represented as a 24 hour period,  humans would only represent 1 min and 17 seconds lol Its sometimes so surprising how small we are in the universe.</UTT>I heard it but I'm skeptical.  That sounds far too high and what's the definition of "natural.</UTT>I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013?  It took 40% of web traffic down.  I probably blamed my ISP.</UTT>I had the iphone 4 a long time ago and now I have the android lol</UTT>Wow, a single Google search requires more computing power than what it took to send Neil Armstrong and 11 others to the moon!</UTT>lol Nice!</UTT>Ha.  I guess Google once used goats instead of people to mow the lawns.  I can't imagine what a hassle it would have been to manage all the goats.

Wow everytime I google search I could be sending someone to the moon instead lol</UTT>Recent readings have confirmed what I always suspected:  woman are more likely to own an iPhone.  I'm a dude and I've owned one.  Android now...</UTT>That is crazy!

The UN actually has an official ambassador to ETs.</UTT>Sorry to hear.  its been great talking to you.</UTT>0
U used to go to a lot of concerts. Do you enjoy concerts?</UTT>I used to like going, not so much anymore. I'm not a big crowd person. I did see Linkin Park back in 2001 one though. It was in support of Hybrid Theory. I heard they played over 300 concerts that year.</UTT>That's an insane amount of concerts. I can't imagine how exhausted you would be.</UTT>I can't either. I've heard that the Ramones played over 2,000 concerts. That's alot of concerts.</UTT>I would have loved to have seen that. I'm assuming a lot of those were at CBGBs.</UTT>I would have loved that too. I always wanted to go see a show a CBGBs back in the day.</UTT>It would have been a great experience. Did you know that there is an ancient roman amphitheater that is still used for concerts in Croatia?</UTT>I would love to see a concert there. It would be breathtaking.</UTT>It would be an experience for sure. Pink Floyd recorded a concert in an ancient theater in Pompeii but they did it with no audience.</UTT>I would love to have been a fly on the wall for that one.</UTT>Me too. Did you know that a lawsuit was filed against Creed due to a concert?</UTT>I heard about that. I guess it was a horrible one.</UTT>Yes it was so bad that four of the attendees sued them. That must be really horrible to make you want to go through that.</UTT>It must have been. I wonder if they won the lawsuit?</UTT>That's a good question. Off topic but I really enjoy clothes and I feel like your shirt is what stands out most in your wardrobe. Do you agree?</UTT>I agree, I have to wear polo shirts for work all the time. Did you know that they were originally invented for tennis?</UTT>I did not. I associated them with polo.</UTT>Yep, they were invented by Rene "The Crocodile" Lacoste and only later adopted by polo players.</UTT>That's very interesting. Did you know that there is a difference between button up and button down?</UTT>I did not, what is the difference?</UTT>Button down is where the collar tips are buttoned to the shirt and button up does not feature this. It was nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

Hi there, are you a football fan?</UTT>I was a big fan, age and other concerns have made me stop and you? I was reading about Adrian Peterson.</UTT>Me too. I'm a Viking fan who is a bit conflicted about AP.</UTT>hahahah why?</UTT>He was really fun to watch before I learned about his child abuse story.</UTT>Wow, was he abused? so sorry about that.</UTT>No, he abused his son. He did play well last season though.</UTT>Wow! so terrible news. Perhaps he was abused, too. You know, those things happens as a cycle. I love quaterbacks, do you happen to have a favorite?</UTT>Favorite to watch might be Aaron Rodgers at his best. How about you></UTT>hahaha it was a long time ago Stabler, did you know him?</UTT>Was stabler a cowboy?</UTT>No, from the evil Oakland's Raiders, perhaps you are too young. I think they are the most important player in the game, well, as well as receivers, etc. etc.</UTT>Definitely. Crazy to think that Alex Smith worked to get a Masters Degree after getting a BA in just two years</UTT>He really worked hard. And he began working on a master´s degree!</UTT>Has to do something after football, and he broke his leg badly this year so he might be done.</UTT>Well, but sure he has a lot of money left. I never knew that the circular huddle was invented for a deaft quaterback, so the other team could not read his hand signals, cool!</UTT>Now they use both headsts and hand signals.</UTT>Did you know that the New Zealand's basketball team are nicknamed the "tall blacks"? I should google why later.</UTT>Maybe they are referring to coffee</UTT>You are right. I don´t know, I like to investigate things, I will do it later, reading that the inventor of basketball James Naismith is the only losing coach in Kansas History. Poor guy!</UTT>Interesting!</UTT>1

Hey, did you know Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph?</UTT>I'd heard something like. Something about being frustrated by late fees. Serves Blockbuster right!</UTT>Yeah. They sure showed Blockbuster. That 40 dollar late fee sure turned into billions for Reed Hastings and the business.</UTT>I wonder whether Netflix is going to disappear like Blockbuster. What is going to replace streaming?</UTT>I don't know, but at the moment both Netflix and also youtube account for half of peak internet traffic for North America.</UTT>People love their video. Who needs a TV when you've got a phone.</UTT>True. Speaking of television, there are over 750 episodes made of pokemon.</UTT>I never watched it. Isn't it for kids? Are they still making that show? How many years has it been going?</UTT>It is an anime. Mostly for the kid age group, but has an older following as well. I like the Simpsons a little. There is only one episode of the simpsons where Bart never is mentioned or makes any kind of appearance.</UTT>I always thought Bart was annoying. I wanted to see more about Lisa. She's great! I prefer South Park overall though.</UTT>Yes, South Park is more interesting I think. Did you know that after South Park did its family guy episode finale, the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew?</UTT>I wonder what that was about. Why did they send flowers?</UTT>They sent them a letter saying, "congratulations on reaching 200 episodes, we already did it, twice" , it seems. They were very friendly with the crew. Too bad television has a lot of advertising, and makes it irritating to sit through programs at times.</UTT>That's why Netflix is great! Less advertising = more time watching what I want. I wish I had bought Netflix stock.The company is worth billions!</UTT>Me too. Blockbuster declined several different offers to buy Netflix for 50 million dollars.</UTT>I guess Blockbuster is down to its last store now. Netflix should buy it as a trophy.</UTT>Ha. What genre do you watch in movies? I sometimes like dramas.</UTT>I like thrillers and dramas. GoT is my go-to for fun. I've watched every episode like 5 times.</UTT>That is reallt popular. Do you know Drama comes from  a Greek word for 'action"?</UTT>I didn't know that! I've heard that the highest paid tv drama actor is a guy named Huge Lorry.</UTT>Yeah. He was in the show House. He was Dr. House. He made 700,000 a show.</UTT>$700 thou USD? He must be pretty good. I never seen the show. I prefer comedies to dramas.</UTT>The show has some comedy as well. Jim carrey stopped doing  drama because he doesn't want to play in a movie that isn't really positive.</UTT>1

Did you know that putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes could help absorb odor?  I have some running shoes that may need that "tea treatment," no doubt.</UTT>I bet whoever first created the smell remover for shoes made a fortune like in the movie holes</UTT>Yes, that would have been a lucrative innovation.  Sometimes a bright idea like that can make someone more money than a lifetime career will; for example, not many people get rich teaching.</UTT>I mean especially if you make shoes for ballet dancers. Each pro goes through 4 pairs a week</UTT>Yes, that would add up over time.  Shoes sponsored by pro athletes are generally pricey as well.  One exception is the 15 dollar pair promoted by Stephon Marbury. Almost everyone could afford those.</UTT>Like jordans. While air jordan were initially banned by the nba, nike was more than willing to pay the fine for jordan to continue wearing them</UTT>Not a surprise; they were still making tons of money off of his name.  During his prime, he was on television it seemed like all the time.  Nike definitely knew how to appeal to the masses with him in its commercials.</UTT>It is ironic then that shoes 5000 years ago were better in performance than today's modern shoes</UTT>Ironic and somewhat sad.  And I'll bet early shoes didn't cost thousands of dollars a pair, or the ancient equivalent.  They were probably more for function than for fashion.</UTT>I wonder how they are better. In health? Energy?</UTT>That's a good question.  Maybe they perform better in regards to durability.  I'm not sure, but now I'm curious.</UTT>On a side note, how do you spend your time otherwise?</UTT>I like watching television when I get time.  South Park is a guilty pleasure and back in the day I loved The Simpsons.  How about you?  Any shows you hate to admit that you like or watch?</UTT>I have to concur. I also enjoyed the 70s show and the office</UTT>The Office was outstanding!  Such awesome satire.  Some people really like Family Guy as well, but I can understand why the South Park creators take shots at it sometime.  It's gotten stale over the years.</UTT>Was there any shows you watched in your youth like pokemon or thomas the engine?</UTT>No, I was more of a Looney Toons child.  But as an adult, I think it's cool that George Carlin narrated so many episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.  Who would have thought the guy behind Seven words You Can Never Say on Television would be a part of a children's show?</UTT>Who is seven words you can never say?</UTT>It was a routine that George Carlin did a long time ago.  The seven words are the ones that can get you in big trouble if you say them on tv.  It was a hilarious routine, but if my mom had known I'd listened to it, she would have tanned my hide, no doubt.</UTT>That sound really interesting. I never knew. Anyway, I thank you for the enjoyable chat.</UTT>Thanks to you as well.  It was fun talking with you!</UTT>I hope you have a wonderful day.</UTT>1

Hi. How are you ? Do you like comic books ? i very much do and my favorite ones are Marvel Comics</UTT>I am well, thanks! I have never really read comic books before but I learned recently that Marvel has been around since 1939 under the name Atlas Comics. I am more of a Netflix person myself haha.</UTT>Yes, Marvel has been around for a long time, i was surprised to find out that Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel in 2009. Oh, and i also enjoy Netflix very much</UTT>It's good to know that a third of the bandwidth in North America is during the 9 pm to 12 am time slot. I wonder if that impacts the user quality, I am not very knowledgeable in that area.</UTT>So does that means most people are up later at night watching Netflix,? I think it is really cool how netflix was created because of a late vhs fee ...lol</UTT>Yeah, I think so. I would wonder if I watched at 2 am if movies would glitch less. I seem to have that issue sometimes but it could be my internet connection. That is cool and I can totally relate. I am not exactly good at remember to return things right away and always end up incurring the dreaded late fee haha.</UTT>Back to the topic of comics, it seems like Netflix has many shows about superheroes or stories based off of popular superheroes which makes it even more popular in my opinion. Considering there are over 300 registered superheros in the USA alone, that is alot to entertain us with.</UTT>I find myself watching documentaries a lot but am looking for new movies to watch! I will have to check out some of the Stan Lee superhero movies like Batman or Superman. Which would you recommend? Normalman sounds kind of funny too.</UTT>I like the disney descendants which is more of a teen or family movie but as an adult i still enjoyed it. It is about the kids of the villians.  What about the garfield spinoff named per force ? Maybe you might like that too. There is so much to choose from. I have not seen Normalman but it sounds very interesting</UTT>That sounds good, and family-friendly as well. I loved Garfield!! I wonder if Netflix has the old episodes, reminds me of my childhood lol. I also think female superheroes are awesome, so maybe I'll have check out some of those ones too.</UTT>To answer your earlier question, i like Superman more than Batman. They are both good movies but Superman reminds me of my childhood and i love Christopher Reeves as Superman. Yes female hero are often called super heroine...i like wonder woman. That movie is on netflix</UTT>Is there a newer Wonder Woman? Thanks for the info! I will check out Superman maybe later today since I am having a lazy day. I am surprised but not surprised at the same time that netflix and youtube make up HALF of North America's internet traffic. People love watching stuff I guess!</UTT>Yes i think people like the ability to stream movies and videos anytime anywhere even on a cell phone, the technology has become so advanced that netflix and youtube are the modern day way to watch tv. i was surprised by how big Netflix is in other countries though I mean Wow , Their company  has offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea.</UTT>Wow! That's pretty impressive, I wonder if that statistic applies across the world. Prob not though haha I can see why Netflix started offering everything online since they spend 20x more on postage than bandwidth!</UTT>i know, its a huge company. With 137 million total subscribers worldwide. I know other companies are starting to pop up now too such as Hulu..sling etc. but netflix is the best i think so far. so much better than renting videos.</UTT>Yeah, I have an Amazon Prime account so I watch on there too. It's crazy to think how much the world has changed in just the past ten years. I think that's when i got my first smartphone. 2009!</UTT>Is amazon Prime similar to netflix ? i thought Amazon Prime was just for shopping?</UTT>Yes! Well, there are a lot of different benefits that you get with the Prime account</UTT>Well I will certainly check out Amazon Prime, thanks for the tip. It has been a really nice and informative chat with you today. :)</UTT>I didn't mean to send that message so quickly, got a little click happy. I also subscribe to amazon Music but that's an extra fee every month unfortunately. Same to you, it's been nice talking with you. Have a nice rest of the day!</UTT>Thank you. Have a good Day. Enjoy your superman movies</UTT>1

Hey there my friend do you like to dance?</UTT>I have been seen dancing in public. Complaints were filed, restraining orders issued.</UTT>Haha I hope not! I never knew that Bruce Lee was a great dancer. He won a Championship back in the 50s</UTT>Bruce Lee was known for inflicting lethal damage in the early rounds of a dance challenge. Competitors were hobbled and could not complete later rounds.</UTT>Haha they should make a movie about that. If only he weren't taken from us so soon. Did you know that ballet dancers can go through about four pairs of shoes a week</UTT>I would personally go through more because of my feet. I think ballet dancers must have the most hard-worked feet.</UTT>They do. I actually dated one and her toes were always super messed up.</UTT>Have you looked at the sun, I mean, *really* looked at it? The sun is actually white, only it looks yellow because of so-called atmospheric scattering I think there is something fishy going on there.</UTT>Wow I didn't know that. why don't they teach that in school. That would be actually useful to know haha. Also crazy is that a lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the Sun</UTT>Lightning could be our source of energy for the future. Harnessing the lightning to save our planet.</UTT>I hope so. Or maybe it can help us to travel back in time with a flux capacitor haha. Did you know that Michael Jackson had a patent</UTT>Michael Jackson put a patent on being cool. What other patent did he have? Hyperbaric oxygen chamber?</UTT>Haha that's insane. He had a patent on that extreme lean movie that he made, there was like a device he created</UTT>Lean movie? I didn't know that he made a movie.</UTT>oh haha I meant lean move, did you know that babies will actually dance to music and dance to the beat of it</UTT>Can babies lean like Michael, even with special shoes? Probably not. Michael wins, just like Jackie Chan did.</UTT>I wish they could! He should have patented a baby leaning device haha also Tupac did ballet in high school. I wonder if anyone has tapes of that</UTT>Tupac probably bought and burned the tapes. 'Pac don't play dat.</UTT>Haha I like that. It's crazy that the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet our energy needs for 500,000 years. I hope we can Harvest that someday</UTT>Keep on truckin Brother. Patent a way to harness the lightning. Leave the sun for the next generation.</UTT>Haha good idea. Do you do anything with fantasy at all? Like fantasy football for instance</UTT>1

Hi, how are you tonight? Do you like footbal, either American or the other kind?</UTT>I actually like American football yes. I don't like soccer though haha. What about you?</UTT>Why don't you like soccer? Too slow? Not enough blood? haha</UTT>Haha yes you could say that. I just think it's really boring haha. But to each their own, did you know that the top Bowlers in the 60s made more than the top football players back then</UTT>Bowlers were lucky that the NFL hadn't really appeared yet. TV could focus on bowling. Now, there's no way. Not enough blood and violence in bowling.</UTT>Yep I agree, watching bowling would even be worse for me than watching stalker LOL. Did you hear about the highest scoring football game ever?</UTT>I probably was like a bowling scores. That would be college ball, too. Lopsided teams?</UTT>I think the teams were definitely lopsided haha. Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland, it would have been really annoying to be a Cumberland fan that day LOL</UTT>I guess someone in scheduling really screwed up there. Why play such a good team? Silly.</UTT>Yep it doesn't seem fair. Do you ever watch football on TV though? You know the yellow line that marks the first down on TV broadcast? That was created by ESPN</UTT>I've seen that line, plus other things like field goal distance and red zone and stuff. I thought it would be obvious to add these things with computers.</UTT>Yep you think so. It does seem very obvious so I don't know why they won an Emmy, but I guess they did so oh well haha.</UTT>ESPN must be so proud of that award too. What will they do as a followup? Haha. Do you get a chance to do much reading?</UTT>I do some reading from time to time. I saw the movie Starship Troopers but never read the book. Apparently it's recommended reading from the US Military</UTT>Heinlein was the author. He was in the Navy, so he wrote a lot of books with a military theme.</UTT>Add that makes sense. Did you ever read the book Ender's Game? I heard that that was a good book, but I didn't like the movie Personally</UTT>The book was great! I didn't see the movie. I think some books just don't translate to the screen very well. The Tolkien books were pretty good on the screen, though.</UTT>Yep very few books end up transferring well to the screen, you're right. When you read do you speed read by the way?</UTT>No, not really a fast reader. I think it could be beneficial in some situations, though I wonder how much you retain.</UTT>Yep, I remember trying it and I couldn't retain anything, that's why I don't believe the world record. There's no way you could retain anything reading 4700 words per minute</UTT>I guess you get the gist, and that's enough for some things. But trying to learn complex material? No way.</UTT>Yep I think you got a point there. Did you hear there was a moral panic in the 18th century, there were too many people reading lol I guess that is not a big deal anymore</UTT>1

Hey how are you, what do you think about Trump?</UTT>I have mixed feelings, I think he can do better in some aspects, how about you?</UTT>I believe he is a disgrace and history will look poorly back on him, I can't believe people buy anything he says. He puts words in peoples mouths like Macron on the european military.</UTT>Good, I agree with you lol, I didn't want to say I hated him and end up you liked him lol. He sucks, in my opinion.</UTT>No he is a complete joke, he is terrible and so are the morons that support him, seriously have to be the dumbest people. I hope he does not win in 2020, otherwise Im moving to New Zealand ha.</UTT>lol you sound like my brother matt, he would say the same thing and move to new zealand also.</UTT>Did you see the EU members and the multinational brigades/</UTT>Did you know Zimbabwe's president is nicknamed president banana?</UTT>That is crazy, do you know who Angela Merkel is, do you like Germany?</UTT>I just know we kicked Germanys butt in both ww1 and ww2</UTT>I wonder if Dee fought in WW2?</UTT>Dee who, a famous soldier? Trump?</UTT>Not sure of his name. I'm also not sure what branch he was in though.</UTT>never heard of that person, I will have to research him. Do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Radio? Is that the technology that uses those crazy radio waves to carry information, like sound and stuff?</UTT>yes, crazy stuff. Radios in am mode can potentially pick up radio storms from jupiter!</UTT>Oh wow, I wonder what they would have to say about government, it is that system or group of people that govern an organized community, often called a state. I wonder if they have governments on Jupiter.</UTT>I think Trumps new Space force can bring democracy to jupiter and even mars</UTT>Not unless wikileaks publishes their plans to go there and colonize it. The US only brings democracy where there is oil, so I'm sure there is a ton there.</UTT>For sure, preach it! Did you know the government owns 86 percent of nevada. Must be doing some experimenting there</UTT>Is that the area called Area 69?</UTT>Yea, it is the cooler area 51. It was nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

Good morning, how are you doing today?</UTT>Fine. Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding sysmbols to derive meaning.</UTT>I really like reading. Did you know that Starship Troopers is on the reading list of 3/5s of the US Military Branches?</UTT>Its amazing. Now days reading is much reduced. People engaged in social media.</UTT>Technology has made me read me more. It's more convenient to use my phone and read.</UTT>Teenager mainly focused on social media. They don't read books and novel or newspaper.</UTT>Yeah that is true. Did you know that Cs Lewis and Tolkien held "you laugh you lose" competitions when reading terrible poetry.</UTT>There was "Moral panic" because of the spread of the reading of novels.</UTT>It seems there's always been a fear of people gaining knowledge.</UTT>Ender's game was suggested reading for many military organizations, including the united states marine corps.</UTT>I really liked that book. Did you know that the FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of US Censorship? That's crazy!</UTT>In 1953 Sir winston churchill won nobel prize and it was in literature.</UTT>That's pretty cool. I heard that Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were Olympic events from 1912 until 1952.</UTT>Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic liteature.</UTT>That's kind of neat. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.</UTT>Literature, is any body of written works. Its used to depth of the knowledge and culture and people living its very interesting.</UTT>It was nice chatting with you.</UTT>Thanks</UTT>Have a good day.</UTT>There are more libraries than mcdonald's in the united states.</UTT>that's neat</UTT>1

What are your favorite animals?</UTT>hello,  I love dogs, dragons, orcas, sharks and octopus'.  How about you?</UTT>Yes I love dogs chimps and dolphins myself haha. I wish that dragons existed because I would love them too. Did you know there are 20 quintillion animals on planet Earth right now</UTT>That is a lot,  I dont even know what quintillion is lol Yeah I wish there wer dragons too,  miniature ones lol other than the kimodo dragon,  that thing is scary.</UTT>Yeah you're right I don't know how many zeros that is actually haha. It's crazy that animals can be millions of a meter up to about 30 meters long. I wish I knew more about animals. Then I would have started to become a zoologist</UTT>I wish I knew what meters is haha.  I hear theres a lawyer in switzerland that represents animals.  How can he do that?  Can he talk to them?</UTT>A great question. Also great question, Germany gave constitutional rights to animals. I wonder what those are. That was done in the year 2002</UTT>I didnt know animals have a dominent hand or paw.  ill have to see which one my dog uses more lol</UTT>Well I didn't know that. Do you know the story behind hiccups as well?</UTT>No whats the story with the hiccups?  Did you know there a type of lobster and jellyfish that are immortal?</UTT>That's pretty awesome! Although I would like to eat a lobster right now haha. And yes hiccups are a holdover from When Animals had both gills and lungs apparently</UTT>Oh right!  I wouldnt mind having gills if it meant I can swim longer and deeper though.</UTT>Wow that sounds awesome! Maybe we can both have y'all's and swim together haha have you ever seen the movie Waterworld though? They definitely hunt those people down haha can you believe that the Loch Ness monster has a special protection against it. The Scottish government did that back in 1912</UTT>Oh right waterworld that was a cool movie!  Yeah throw in some webbed feet too!!!!  That sounds good,  Id rather have gills and webbed feet than a tail lol</UTT>Sure that sounds awesome LOL. What about Facebook do you use Facebook at all? We need to make a Waterworld Facebook page with only Gill people</UTT>Yeah I used facebook!  we should see if there is one already,  that seems easier lol You never know..</UTT>Well apparently Iceland is rewriting their constitution on Facebook. So I think we should write a constitution for Gill people only</UTT>That probably saves a lot of paper for them!  Did you know there are more people on facebook that there were people in the world 200 years ago?</UTT>Wow that's crazy. What do you know about the Burger King Whopper promotion that they did on Facebook</UTT>I think they offer a whopper for unfriending people.  Is their friendship worth a whopper?</UTT>Haha yep that's what it was. You would have to unfriend 10 people though. I can definitely find 10 people I would unfriend though</UTT>lol well its been great talking,  have a good one.</UTT>1

have you had someone put a lighter near your ear to heal an earache?</UTT>No way!  How does that even work?</UTT>according to the article, the author's father would roll up newspaper in a cone and light it thinking it would heal the earache</UTT>Wow!  I am thankful my parents didn't follow traditions to cure earaches.  I wonder if he has an exhibition in Baltimore at the Parenting: An art without a Manual.  Sounds like that father should have his own display!</UTT>haha seriously! what do you think are some of the things on display there?</UTT>Remember the Simpson's?  Homer and Marge?  I can picture lots of displays with some of their antics through the years.  I am sure it's full of well intentioned unconditional loving parents who made innocent mistakes or had crazy fears.</UTT>yes i'm seeing now the the exhibit is both heartbreaking and hilarious, it must span all sorts of parenting debacles</UTT>Absolutely!  Typically, anyone can be a parent.  Even Charles Manson had a son.  I can't imagine growing up under his shadow.</UTT>whoa i didnt know he had a child! did the child even know him?</UTT>I don't know, but there is an exhibition that uses art to portray families like his and other dysfunctional families.  I have heard it is an emotional exhibition.</UTT>yes it sounds like it. especially that exhibit portraying his mother who committed suicide and abusive father</UTT>Very sad indeed!  I liked the piano analogy that expresses that children are like piano's that just because you have one doesn't mean you can play (or parent).  It reminds me of the hindenburg tragedy.  They brought aboard a 356lb grand piano on the flight.</UTT>what happened in the tragedy?</UTT>The Hindenburg crashed and caught fire.  Some climbers found a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain in 2006.  I know the Hindenburg piano caught fire, but it makes you wonder how a piano made it to the top of a mountain.</UTT>it sure does, and do you think the piano caused the plane to crash or it was just an odd coincidence that it was aboard?</UTT>The piano didn't cause the crash or else it would be famous like the piano used to record 2 famous songs the Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude.  Those songs are amazing.  I wonder what songs the BBC broadcasted in 1930 instead of news reporting.</UTT>i know do you think it was classical music? It must have been something to appeal to the masses</UTT>I am not sure, but the news must have been really dull to end up playing piano music.  Too bad we don't do that today.  We should also be allowed to equip our cars with flame throwers to prevent carjacking like in South-Africa.  Now that is newsworthy!</UTT>haha that would be newsworthy, and dangerous! yikes</UTT>Yes!  Good things our trunks aren't made out of wood anymore or that could be a serious fire situation.</UTT>it was great chatting with you :D</UTT>1

Same with the simpson but being on network TV, I could access it later in my life.</UTT>0
Do you like the NFL?</UTT>I am. I'm a big fan of sports and sports trivia, in general.</UTT>Great, sounds like we will get along, I am a fan of sports as well, do you have a favorite team?</UTT>Definitely not the Saints. They have a pretty sexist policy I'm not a fan of regarding the cheerleaders and players.</UTT>That rule is so unfair, makes me angry, its really humiliating</UTT>Yeah, can you believe they can't even eat in the same restaurant? Not only that, but if a player comes into the restaurant while a cheerleader is already mid-meal, the cheerleader has to leave.</UTT>Terrible rule, I would be so angry and feel so bad if I had to leave, specially if im with friends and family, humiliating and really unfair,</UTT>Oddly enough, though, did you know the league itself has no written rule saying women can't play?</UTT>I don't think that will ever happen, watching a woman play in the NFL</UTT>Apparently, as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements, they can play.</UTT>I bet woman could be as capable as men in the game if they had the same strength</UTT>Sounds like the increase of females in engineering will be worth it over a career in football, anyhow, as the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of a football player.</UTT>Oh I see, and I do agree sexism can be another issue, amazing how much money engineers make</UTT>It's pretty crazy how much football players make though, considering the average game only has an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay.</UTT>Only 11 minutes? what a scam, the game lasts 60 minutes and only 11 minutes accounts to less than a quarter,</UTT>A televised game lasts even longer than an hour, in my experience. I suppose we could use the tracking chips in the players' pads and the balls to find out how they really spend most of their time.</UTT>That is a great idea, that way we can tell the distance they actually run, the calories and many different stats about the game, cool facts and stats</UTT>More specifically, they use the tracking devices to track velocity, rotation, ball speed, and location.</UTT>Do you like basketball as well?</UTT>I like it less than football, but I think it's funny that the US Supreme Court building has a basketball court on top of the building called "the highest court in the land".</UTT>That is a great name for a court, must be really nice to play or watch a game there, judges must play tournamets all the time</UTT>1

How's it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley</UTT>I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan!</UTT>It's kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie</UTT>Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later</UTT>I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins</UTT>right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office</UTT>Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie</UTT>Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don't do anything else lol</UTT>Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too</UTT>I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?</UTT>I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie</UTT>I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget!</UTT>Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop</UTT>sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol</UTT>Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office</UTT>for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing</UTT>That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he's grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office</UTT>Man, he should be in every movie at that much money! Youre guaranteed to make money at that rate i think</UTT>Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw</UTT>That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!</UTT>Have a good one</UTT>1

Hello there, do you enjoy comedy movies or tv shows?</UTT>I do enjoy them both. What about you? I love Comedy Central but hate that they have cancelled over 100 shows since the network began in 1989.</UTT>I really love comedy both in movies and tv.  That is a crazy amount of shows to be cancelled!</UTT>Agreed. Can you also believe the Green Lantern movie was initially going to be a comedy with Jack Black? I would have like to have seen that!</UTT>That is pretty funny, yeah I would have seen that!</UTT>Did you ever watch 3rd Rock From the Sun? I was so happy when it won the best comedy series Golden Globe back in 97. It had some stiff competition but still won the award and they deserved it!</UTT>Yeah I used to watch that shows years ago when it was still airing.  I think there are a lot of friends fans who were upset, I don't care for friends myself.</UTT>Neither do I, honestly! What about Kung Fu Hustle? I kind of agree with Bill Murray when he basically said it's the supreme achievement of modern age comedy.</UTT>I think I read about that back when he said it, I think he was being super sarcastic.</UTT>Maybe so! Are you also a fan of British comedy group Monty Python? The Python Programming Language creator basically named it that to honor the group! I thought that was cool.</UTT>I used to love watching those movies as a kid.  I think that is a really cool tribute too!</UTT>So true! So speaking of comedy, did you like Incredibles 2? I enjoyed it even though the present day events were set way back in the 1960s!</UTT>Yeah I thought it was pretty good, and I thought that was cool it was set back then.</UTT>I think it's funny the Director Brad Bird only used artists who were likely to be fired or quit Pixar because he believed they were capable of creating what he needed. That was smart of him!</UTT>That is pretty wild, and I guess he also did one of the voices in the movie, probably saved some bucks.</UTT>Yeah, he probably did. Did you know a sequel came out in the form of a video game 13 years before Incredibles 2 that's called Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer?</UTT>No I never knew that, that is kind of crazy though, there are probably some conspiracy theorists out there talking lol.</UTT>You maybe right about that. Ha! Speaking of video games, did you ever play the Nintendo Entertainment System? It's hard to believe it could only display 54 colors!</UTT>I used to love playing that as a kid, we played whole seasons of Tecmo Super Bowl with all my friends. How about you?</UTT>I loved it as well! In fact, I can't believe it wasn't discontinued until 2003 in Japan. I figured it was long before that!</UTT>Yeah that is one hell of a run for a video game system!  Nice talking with you today, have a good one!</UTT>1

Do you use Facebook?</UTT>All the time, both as a business and a personal account.</UTT>nice, I have a personal account. Can you imagine if myspace would have bought facebook back in the day at 75 million dollars</UTT>They would definitely be a lot more relevant today.  I havent been on my space since 2006 anyway...</UTT>me too lol. I think myspace would have ruined this. Now facebook is worth like 104 billion dollars</UTT>It must be nice to be Mark Zuckerburg.</UTT>For sure, he has been in the press too much lately, I couldn't do that</UTT>He is actually color-blind that is why facebook is blue.</UTT>Wow didn't know that, I always thought blue was too much lol. Did you ever participate in the burger king promotion?</UTT>No!  I could have eaten well for free though.  I could get rid of some people on my friends list for a whopper.</UTT>For sure, I have a ton of friends i could unadd lol</UTT>It sure has a lot of use.  Iceland is even using it for input on constitution rewrites.</UTT>That is hilarious. I wonder if they get some crazy ideas! At least they allow the like button, some german state made it illegal</UTT>I have heard that before.  I wonder how that works, if there is some sort of geofence that disables it for all people when they are in that region.</UTT>I was just thinking the same thing. Sounds more illegal than anything lol</UTT>It really kind of does, like censorship.</UTT>for sure, oh well, at least it isn't here lol. do you like fish</UTT>I like to loo at them, eat them not so much.  However Id like to be like that immortal jellyfish.  Thatd be cool</UTT>There is no way that thing couldn't die lol, there has to be a way! It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>It has been a great chat!  Have a great day!</UTT>you too, and a great weekend!</UTT>1

I find space to be fascinating. How about you?</UTT>I do too! Can you believe the sunset on mars is blue?</UTT>I had no idea. I bet that is beautiful. Did you know that sound on Mars may have a higher pitch than on Earth?</UTT>I believe it! Mars is so cool, I'm glad we are getting more research done up there!</UTT>I agree. If you were able to fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration it would only take 2 or 3 days. Maybe we will be able to accomplish that someday.</UTT>I'm sure we will! I think it is cool that curiosity robot sings happy birthday to itself on mars!</UTT>Oh wow! That's adorable. Apparently Lichens and Cybanobacteria would be able to live on Mars. Do you think we will find microscopic life on Mars?</UTT>I hope we do! Do you know why we call it mars?</UTT>I do not. Why do we call it Mars?</UTT>It's named after the roman god of war! Interesting huh?</UTT>Very interesting. I should have guessed that since so many celestial bodies are named after gods. Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars?</UTT>I didn't hear about that, what happened?</UTT>It was because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but Nasa used metric. Whoops.</UTT>Maybe they should have planned that a little better! I think it's epic that the sun makes up 99.86 percent of the mass of our solar system!</UTT>I did not know that either. That's mind boggling.</UTT>I agree! There's even a radio station that translate solar activity into sound for you!</UTT>That would be interesting to listen to. Did you know that the sun is actually white?</UTT>I didn't know that, I wonder why we see it as yellow!</UTT>It is because of atmospheric scattering.</UTT>That is so interesting! Earth and everything is so exciting! Well I had a great chat with you!</UTT>Nice chatting with you as well. Have a lovely evening.</UTT>1
Oh did not know that, and which one would that be?</UTT>I do not. Why do we call it Mars?</UTT>I'm sure we will!

Hi, do you watch Brooklyn nine nine?</UTT>Hi, I don't but I heard it was cancelled? Are you a big fan?</UTT>I am a big fan. It was canceled by Fox but picked up by NBC. It has such good writing on it. Do you watch a lot of tv?</UTT>Oh that's good. Fox loss. They seem to cancel a lot of shows people really like. I do watch a lot of TV.</UTT>I watch a little tv but I always have live sports on in the back ground. Not sure why.</UTT>I'm just glad fox hasn't cancelled The Simpsons. After all these years I still find it funny.</UTT>Me too. Although they had some infighting at one point. Fox News wanted to sue the simpsons.</UTT>Yes. Simpsons often make fun of Fox. When you think about it, the show doesn't really fit their other programming but they know it makes them so much money. It will be weird when it finally does come to an end. Homer has had so many different jobs through the years..</UTT>How many jobs has he had?</UTT>Well over 200 now. Over the first 400 episodes he had 188 and there are a lot more new episodes with new jobs.</UTT>Wow. My wife would kill me if I changed jobs that often. And Mr. Burns must be a good guy to always take him back at the plant.</UTT>haha, true. Mr. Burns is not as evil as some would have you believe. The only reason I still look forward to Halloween is new Treehouse of horror episodes.</UTT>Those are good. It's the only time we really get to see the aliens.</UTT>Kang and Kodos! So I went to buy a new TV at best buy a few weeks ago, and they had to go into the warehouse to get one for me. The guy took forever to come back. Turns out he found an old black and white tv while he was looking for my led tv.</UTT>Really? That's nuts. How big was it?</UTT>Just little, maybe 15" which is probably how it went unnoticed for so long. It's amazing how much tv technology has changed. The led is way better then the plasma I replaced.</UTT>Yeah. I remember we had a small TV we took on camping trips and it never worked.</UTT>Even the simpsons cartoon tv has been replaced with a more modern 16x9 tv compared to the old one they had. It's interesting 3d tv never took off..</UTT>My friend had one and it was so uncomfortable watching it with glasses on. I think if they did sports in 3d, that would have been better.</UTT>Maybe, but if you're going to go that far you might as well just go watch the event live. I agree they are too uncomfortable.</UTT>It was great chatting with you! Have a great day!</UTT>1

Hi, did you ever play with a Nintendo?</UTT>I did love my Nintendo - I have not played on it in years tho.</UTT>Did you know it only had 54 colors?</UTT>I did actually.  I seem to remember that it stopped being made around 2003?</UTT>Yes, it was a great console and so much fun to play with</UTT>Are you a football fan?  This season was great ending with the Super Bowl</UTT>I sure am . Did you know women can play too in the NFL?</UTT>Yes I had heard that but it has never happened.  I would like to work for Matt Patricia - he is an actual rocket scientist</UTT>Wow that is pretty cool, what a career change that must have been</UTT>Yes - his school RPI  had the best fight song - it included sin cosine and tangent as well as 6 digits of pi</UTT>Haha that is so awesome. There are only 11 minutes of live gameplay  in a game</UTT>Yes that is not very much - that must be why engineers make more than NFL players</UTT>Yup that makes sense. They also have longer careers so maybe that helps a bit there too</UTT>Yes - did you know the first NFL playoff game was in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field?</UTT>Cool, did not know that. Did you hear of that rule that New Orleans cheerleaders have to abide to?</UTT>That they have to leave the restaurant if a player walks in?  That is awful!</UTT>That sure is and I really think it is outdated and needs to go</UTT>Definitely - even though it is allowed I cannot see the Saints allowing a female player</UTT>I guess. DO you like Brady?</UTT>Tom Brady is an amazing quarterback who has won 6 super bowls.</UTT>He sure is and there is no stopping the guy. Nice chat</UTT>1

What forms of entertainment do you enjoy?</UTT>I breed chickens. Just kidding. I enjoy movies, radio, and music. A good movie soundtrack really hits the spot!  What about you?</UTT>Lol nice intro</UTT>Thanks. Maybe I could get a job with Steven Spielberg... He can play the clarinet like he did for the soundtrack of Jaws, and I can pretend to be talented.  What do you think?</UTT>I always like it when the director or producer directly plays a part like stan lee</UTT>Yeah, or M. Night Shamalan (spelling?). I alsolike it when celebrities mock themselves, like Kanye West did on SNL. Although Taylor Swift may not have enjoyed that...</UTT>True. I agree</UTT>You gotta have a sense of humor about these things!  Like when Taylor Swift acceidnetally release 8 seconds of white noise, which ended up topping the charts in Canada! Tat is a great commentary on what Canadians enjoy about Swift music...</UTT>I guess it is all about the brand</UTT>Maybe. Do you think her proclivity to walk backwards to avoid having her photo taken is brand-building?</UTT>No. I genuinely think paparazzi are jerks</UTT>Agreed.  Still, it would be nice to have her $40 mil jet and personal airport hanger in Nashville. Right?</UTT>True True</UTT>Let change the subject to something more profound and significant... Haave you ever read "Starship Troopers"...after all, it is on the reading list of 3 of the 5 military branches, so it's gotta be good, right??</UTT>I have read it as well as Ender's game. Both great books</UTT>Did you experience a "Moral Panic" from those novels like so many did in the 18th century upon reading novels?</UTT>Lol of course not</UTT>I would love to attend one of those "You laugh, you lose" contests made famous by CS Lewis and Tolkien. I could end up being the biggest loser!</UTT>Indeed. It would be really fun to watch. Kind of like harmon's quest</UTT>Oh, and it would be really lovely if they speed-read their horrible poetry out loud! I don't know if they could achieve the record 4700 words per minute laike Anne Jones, but it would be fun watching them try!</UTT>Indeed. Anyway thanks for chatting.</UTT>1
Indeed. Anyway thanks for chatting.</UTT>True. I agree</UTT>Let change the subject to something more profound and significant...

I don't know if they could achieve the record 4700 words per minute laike Anne Jones, but it would be fun watching them try!</UTT>I always like it when the director or producer directly plays a part like stan lee</UTT>I have read it as well as Ender's game. Both great books</UTT>I'm not sure. He was in trouble for robbing stores, shooting a clerk, and shooting at officers, but I think in the controlled situation of the court, his past doesn't justify the response.</UTT>True True</UTT>Yeah, or M. Night Shamalan (spelling?). I alsolike it when celebrities mock themselves, like Kanye West did on SNL. Although Taylor Swift may not have enjoyed that...</UTT>Maybe. Do you think her proclivity to walk backwards to avoid having her photo taken is brand-building?</UTT>I breed chickens. Just kidding. I enjoy movies, radio, and music. A good movie soundtrack really hits the spot!  What about you?</UTT>What forms of entertainment do you enjoy?</UTT>Lol of course not</UTT>You gotta have a sense of humor about these things!  Like when Taylor Swift acceidnetally release 8 seconds of white noise, which ended up topping the charts in Canada! Tat is a great commentary on what Canadians enjoy about Swift music...</UTT>I guess it is all about the brand</UTT>Indeed. It would be really fun to watch.

Good morning! How are you today?</UTT>hi how are you? I'm good</UTT>I'm doing well! Are you a fan of football at all?</UTT>I sometimes watch. i try to watch the super bowl.</UTT>This year it was so boring! It was even more boring to know that only 11 minutes of live gameplay happened in it haha.</UTT>I think the game was better the previous year. a big comeback at the end. 11 minutes? yeah, it seems too short. but there is so much violence, people love it.</UTT>Oh I agree! I bet it was a better game than in 1916 where Cumberland lost to Georgia Tech 222-0 lol.</UTT>I wonder what the coach was thinking there. I think that a game like that is shameful. what is the point?</UTT>I feel like the team just gave up from the beginning. Maybe they had a pink locker room like the Iowa Hawkeye's visitor locker room is.</UTT>that pink locker room stunt! does that work at all? does u of Iowa win a lot at home? i doubt it.</UTT>I don't think it works. I'm a Hawkeye fan and they seem to win more on the road haha.</UTT>if it worked, other teams would do the same thing. still, it is a fun fact.</UTT>Well said! Can you believe the Green Bay Packers have been around since 1919?</UTT>Yes, i can. that is a strange name though. what exactly do they pack?</UTT>I'm not sure! I know they were started based off the name of Indian Packing Company!</UTT>Oh, that makes sense. were they a meat packing company? did they own the team? i think the team is owned by the city now.</UTT>I know they paid for the Packers first uniforms if they named the team after them. Good move on their part since they've sold out every game since 1960!</UTT>yeah, i wonder how much it would cost to buy tix from someone. the secondary market must be expensive.</UTT>I agree! I wish I would have been at the game where they first lost to the Beloit Fairies. That is a unique name for a football team!</UTT>What a name. How would you like play for that team? "Hello, im a fairy. No seriously, I am!" Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Haha too funny! Have a great day!</UTT>1

Do you like horror films?</UTT>Not really. Do you like them?  I've heard that watching them can burn calories.</UTT>I dont really like them either but if I can burn 180 calories then I might give then a try lol</UTT>i hear that lol!  It's weird but watching a horror movie can make you like abstract art more for some reason.</UTT>I see, thats interesting, a movie I did like was the Shining, have you seen that one?</UTT>I saw that one a long time ago.  .  I guess Bram Stoker is the catalyst for my favorite horror movie if you can call it that. I have a deep fear of Salem's Lot.</UTT>I do too, well in the shining the boy, Danny, didnt even know he was in a horror film he was tricked lol</UTT>I guess they did that so as not to scare him maybe.  Have you read any Edgar Allan Poe.  HIs works are said to have inspired some horror movies today.</UTT>I have, he has great poems, I think that his contributions are important, authors like him, Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley have sure transformed things.</UTT>They really have.  I wonder what made them write what they did.  It was all so long ago. I mean, horror has been around now for over a hundred years.</UTT>I guess their stories were so dark that the horror genre was born, maybe they didnt have that in mind, to have such influence on literature.</UTT>Maybe not.  Literature has had an effect on television too.  Sometimes you can't tell though. I mean, pokemon has over 750 episodes but i really have no idea what old literature could have inspired that!</UTT>Well I love Pokemon, its been one of my favorite shows for over 16 years now although the original pokemons were my favorite</UTT>I like it too I just mean I don't see where it could have gotten it's inspiration.  Maybe it just comes from studying animals in general.  Perhaps the creators of Pokemon were into zoology.</UTT>Thats an interesting question, I think they were, afterall there are 20 quintillion animals on the planet so there plenty of places to look for inspiration.</UTT>That's definitely true.  You could even look back into early life when some animals had gills and lungs.</UTT>I think thats why we have hiccups, they are some kind of holdover from previous years</UTT>You're probably right about that.  Thinking about old dinosaurs and such makes me think of the Loch Ness Monster. Did you know it is a protected species in Scotland?</UTT>I did not know that, I guess its a good thing in case a hunter decides to get it as a trophy, it would be amazing to see the Lochness Monster live.</UTT>It truly would.  I like to think that it is real and somewhere in the deep, unexplored depths of the ocean.  I mean, over 1.5 million animals are known and it's estimated there are over 7 million so it's possible.</UTT>I think we just have to look harder and we might find it, I hope to be alive by then.</UTT>1

Hello! Are you interested in Presidents?</UTT>I love leaders of republics. How about you?</UTT>I find president history fascinating. Do you know the tip three wealthiest presidents?</UTT>JFK was one of them. I am less sure about the others.</UTT>It was jfk, washington, and jefferson.</UTT>But Washington had wooden teeth didn't he? YOu think he could afford ivory... Does the President of Zimbabwe, Pres Banana,  has his original teeth?</UTT>I am not sure. But i wonder why they call him Banana?</UTT>Maybe he has gone soft on crime?  Or, maybe it is his stage name, in preparation for release of his new cd? He has to catch up on released albums to the standard set by Pres of Indonesia</UTT>I think it is funny that he has released 3 pop albums.</UTT>That is funny. Another funny fact: The runner up in Pres elections used to automatically earn the spot of VP. Can you imagine the insaity it would create if that rule wa still in place?</UTT>That was probably crazy with opposing views.</UTT>The Gov is a crazy entity.   Did you know that 86% of Nevada is owned by the feds?</UTT>That is crazy! I wonder what they do with all of that property?</UTT>They need some of it to store the Eiffel Tower they just bought froom some impersonator of the French Gov...</UTT>I heard that he sold the tower twice!</UTT>Incredible!  At least the Norwegian Gov didn;t bite. They had their money tied up in a $1 Bil pledge to help save the Amazon rain forest.</UTT>I wish more people could pledge that much money</UTT>I wonder what the French dude accepted as payment for the tower?  Well, all this show of confidence is why states like Nevada are putting a slot for "None of these candidates" on the ballot for Pres...</UTT>I am not sure. I would need to do more research.</UTT>While you are researching, find out who the tallest presidential candidate is this go round... Since 1900, the taller candidate has wone over 70% of the time...</UTT>I will look into it! Have a nice day.</UTT>1

Good evening!  Do you have a chance to travel much?</UTT>Hi,</UTT>I don't travel a lot.  I am certainly no King Kalakaua of Hawaii who actually traveled around the world and was the first king to do so.</UTT>I hit enter too soon! Sorry. Yes, I have been fortunate to visit Italy in 2018 and Iceland in 2017. This year we are going to Africa. I was surprised that tourism in the US is down! Do you think it is the political environment?</UTT>It could be.  When you were in Iceland did you take flights to go from city to city since there isn't really a rail provider?</UTT>No, we rented a car because we had two weeks and getting all the way around is doable with a car. Driving was good and we went in October so didn't have to contend with snow. Where have you traveled?</UTT>I have been to Hawaii and Germany, but it is usually just in the continental US.  I wouldn't mind going to Japan, but i hear the tolls are very expensive!</UTT>Yes, $300 to travel across the country! In Italy, we took a toll road and had to hunt for the 28 euro when we finally exited the road. We were in the Amalfi Coast in October and I was really surprised how crowded it was. I can understand what the article is saying about overcrowding.</UTT>While tourism is usually a good thing, countries really have to plan and prepare for it.  If they don't plan appropriately, they will definitely have trouble dealing with an influx of travelers.</UTT>We are seeing that in California. Places like Big Sur have had so many tourists taking selfies at iconic places and then leaving trash or doing something dangerous just to get that perfect picture.</UTT>Maybe it is time to go to a simpler place like Mackinac island where they still use horse-drawn carriages and cars are banned.</UTT>People will eventually find all the great spots. The article mentions Emilia-Romagna or Extremadura. I have never heard of either of those places.</UTT>Well maybe you will go there sometime soon.  I think I'd take that over a trip to any of the Walt Disney themed parks though.</UTT>Not a Disneyland fan? Have you ever been? I went about 2 years ago with daughter's family. It was a zoo. And it was March which can't be the most popular time.</UTT>I think I just have issues with Disney in general.  I can't deny their success though.  I find it interesting that they would choose a celebrity like Bill Nye to work on the Flubber movie.</UTT>How about their business model of reinventing something? Beauty and the Beast as an animated film, then a Broadway musical, then a live action movie.</UTT>I find making hits out of already hits to be lazy.  I guess they do have some original content like Big Hero 6 where they used a big supercomputer to render the whole thing.</UTT>Right - but not sure how successful Big Hero 6 was. Interesting facts about the telephone. It sounds like fake news that Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone. How would they know?</UTT>Why not just give them the clean water anyway?  if we can male an iPhone with more computing capabilities than our US Nuclear ICBM armament, you think they could figure out better ways to  give kids clean water.</UTT>Good point. Well, I'm looking forward to hearing more about a bus that will travel at 160 mph. Not sure I want to ride on it though.</UTT>As long as it is safe and efficient, but I doubt I will be seeing anything like that near me anytime soon.</UTT>nice chatting with  you!</UTT>Same with you.</UTT>1

Merry Christmas!  I am just about to watch something on Netflix.</UTT>Merry Christmas ! What are you watching ?</UTT>I was thinking of watching Stranger Things. Have you watched that series yet?</UTT>Yes I did. They did a great job showing the 80s :) music, clothing, etc.</UTT>I am looking forward to it.  Netflix has really come a long way in just a few years.</UTT>absolutely, from like 2 movies in 2016 they went to dozens in 2018. They're doing a great job !</UTT>I agree.  They haven't completely eclipsed HBO, but they definitely put themselves in front of nominations.</UTT>...but didn't GoT got the most awards ? I don't remember...</UTT>I know it is the banner program for HBO.  I bet GoT is expensive to make, but it is still doing really well.</UTT>yes, but sometimes the fact that Netflix has SO many tvshows, it doesn't mean that the quality is high as well...</UTT>I guess if you put a lot out, something is bound to be good.  Can you believe that between 9pm and 12am, Netflix accounts for one third of all North American bandwidth?</UTT>sorry I didn't understand that ? Netflix accounts for one third of all North American what ?</UTT>Bandwidth is how they measure things like internet/wifi usage.  So what it really means is a lot of people are watching Netflix each night.</UTT>I wonder how they measure that ?</UTT>I believe whatever network you are using measures it.  Regardless, it's crazy to think that Netflix was started by someone who racked up late fees on a movie rental.</UTT>movie rentals ? Is that who founded Netflix?</UTT>His name is Reed Hastings.</UTT>Now he probably sits on a beach ans drinking whiskey :) he doesn't have to work anymore :)</UTT>I know!  His company is worth $2 billion, and another company decline a chance to buy it for $50 million.</UTT>do You know what company is that ?</UTT>That was Blockbuster which used to be a movie rental place, but I believe is now bankrupt.</UTT>...and they wanted to buy out Netflix ?</UTT>I don't know who initiated, but I know they thought $50 million must have been too much.  Have a Merry Christmas.</UTT>1

do you like shakespeare?</UTT>I do. Did you know that he popularized many words and phrases?</UTT>Yes like, good riddance in my heart of hearts and many more</UTT>Yes. He lived at the same time as Pocahontas too</UTT>I wonder what it might have been like had they met somehow</UTT>Yeah. Did you know Tchaikovsky was obsessed with Shakespeare?</UTT>Yes he donated his skull to be used in his plays eventually</UTT>Yes and it was used for the skull of yorick in hamlet</UTT>Yea. Did you know he also invented some names?</UTT>Yes names like Jessica, Olivia and Miranda</UTT>Yeah. And some of his plays have to be played in old english as they change meaning otherwise</UTT>Yes otherwise puns do not work in modern day language</UTT>Yeah. Do you like dramas?</UTT>Yes I do. Have you ever seen House MD?</UTT>Yes , Laurie made $700 000 per episode in that show</UTT>Yeah that is a lot. Do you like Jim Carrey?</UTT>Yes he is so funny. Did you know he does not do dramas anymore?</UTT>Yes as they do not project positivity</UTT>Yeah, I guess that makes sense quite a bit</UTT>Yeah. It was nice chatting with you</UTT>Same here</UTT>1

They are the only animals besides elephants that can naturally understand pointing.</UTT>I think dogs understand quite a few words too. smarter than chimps in many ways.</UTT>And they arent color blind as I was once taught!</UTT>I thought they were colorblind too. I guess that they see some colors, which makes sense. they have great ears and noses too.</UTT>Apparently they can see as many colors as we can. Do you think that's true?</UTT>that sounds funny. it think the visual cortex of humans is far more developed. maybe we have been resolution? i dont know.</UTT>Ah, that could be right! In Istanbul you can get food for strays by recycling bottles at a vending machine. Pretty interesting.</UTT>I think that was a clever idea. it was good to get the dogs involved in keeping the city clean. plus they get fed!</UTT>Haha, true! Dogs can also donate blood at blood drives. Not sure how I feel about that though, doesn't seem they can really consent.</UTT>True, but the dogs probably would like to help if they could. usually dogs are pack animals. they look out for each other.</UTT>That might be why we love them so much. Google even prefers dogs to cats and says so on their code of conduct.</UTT>I think that dogs are pretty good for the office. People pet dogs and their mood improves. I would love to work in an office with a dog.</UTT>Do you commute to work?</UTT>Sometimes. I do a lot of telecommuting.</UTT>I guess we have the 1908 Model T to thank for being able to commute easily. But Karl Benz was the one who invented what's considered the modern car.</UTT>Every car maker owes a debt to benz. Ford made the car available to the common man.</UTT>Cars were adopted really fast in the US though they took a while to get accepted in other parts of the world. Glad we don't have to travel by horse and carriage anymore.</UTT>Yes, there were tremendous problems with manure in cities. It was a pretty smelly problem. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Nice chat! Time for me to take a drive, I guess!</UTT>1

Did you ever use Myspace?</UTT>Yes, they had a chance to buy Facebook for $75 millions and did not</UTT>Yesh too bad they could have made billions by now</UTT>Yeah true. Do you know the like button is illegal in parts of Germany?</UTT>Yes I wonder what happened there for it to be illegal</UTT>Yeah. DO you know why it is blue?</UTT>Yes because Mark is colorblind for green and red</UTT>Yeah. In Iceland they are using it to rewrite the constitution</UTT>Yes I wonder how that is working, it is pretty public</UTT>Yeah I know. Do you watch much tv?</UTT>I do . Do you watch the Simpsons at all?</UTT>Yes I do. There is an episode where Bart does not appear at all</UTT>Yea and he is not even mentioned in it</UTT>Yeah. Did you ever watch That 70s Show?</UTT>Yes it was good but it did not do well in the UK though</UTT>Yes it failed after just 10 episodes because they remade it verbatim</UTT>Yeah. Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank?</UTT>Yes, did you know Alec Baldwin did the voice for 52 epsidoes?</UTT>Yes and so did Ringo Starr and George Carlin too. What a cast of actors.</UTT>I know star studded cast for sure. Nice chatting today with you.</UTT>1

Hello! How are you today?</UTT>Im great! how are you?</UTT>Doing well too! Do you like to use Amazon?</UTT>I like to use amazon sometimes. it can be quite convenient. You?</UTT>It really is. I do too, been getting just about everything from there now haha. Even on Sundays!</UTT>I am amazed that the USPS delivers on sundays. i thought those guys would never work on sundays. they must get triple overtime.</UTT>My day was a postman but he never had to go out on Sundays. It is usually the part time people that got paid 16 bucks an hour to go do it. Kind of sad if you ask me.</UTT>Ok, so it is not expensive for the post office to deliver. i guess part timers need the work. It is probably better than the amazon warehouse.</UTT>Yes I agree, unless you want to walk 7 to 15 miles each day working haha.</UTT>i guess it keeps you in shape, or it kills you. one or the other. i dont think the pay is good either.</UTT>I heard it's terrible to work there! I wish I was the first person to make a purchase from Amazon back in the day!</UTT>You could have a building named after you! I would rather have amazon prime for life.</UTT>But you can at least brag about the building since everybody has Prime haha.</UTT>Yes, that is true. I wonder if people know his name. maybe he got stuck with a warehouse job too LOL</UTT>They probably told him it would be the best job in the world, jokes on him though haha. I like using Google a lot as well.</UTT>I use google a lot. google is a dog company. i approve.</UTT>I approve with two thumbs up! They also like goats too and let them be their landscapers haha.</UTT>do the goats get stock options? if so, sign me up!</UTT>They are probably more well of than we are lol. Well it was nice chatting with you!</UTT>yes, i enjoyed chatting with you. Have a good day!</UTT>Thanks you as well!</UTT>1

Have you ever seen Keeping up with the Kardashians?</UTT>Yes, I know bits and pieces. I know Kim was born 10-21-80.</UTT>Yeah, it's basically just her and her family doing everyday life things. Did you know she named her baby Chicago?</UTT>I did know. It is a nod to Kanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K  so the name is perfect because baby Chicago was hard to conceive so she is extra special as well.</UTT>That's a pretty sweet meaning. Did you know Kim used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant?</UTT>I did know. That is how she first gained media attention but after her 2003 sex tape was leaked in 2007 she really became popular.</UTT>That</UTT>I know one of my kids used to play the Kim Kardashian app on their phone. I think it came out in 2014.</UTT>Sorry about that, I accidentally pressed enter. I haven't used the app, but I have heard of it. She was also in a fall out boy music video. I wonder which song?</UTT>I did not know she was in a music video. I know after the 2007 sex tape leak she and her family began appearing on E! reality TV show Keeping up With the Kardashians.</UTT>Yeah, that's a really lucky break for releasing a sex tape. I'm pretty sure her mom released it on purpose.</UTT>Maybe. I know Kim is on the 2015 Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential people.</UTT>She definitely has a lot of influence. She recently met with trump to discuss prison reform.</UTT>I did not know that, but good for her. I know she also has a book about how she is a trailblazer of the selfie movement.</UTT>Yeah, she's definitely a busy and hardworking person. Speaking of celebrities, did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode?</UTT>Holy cow! That is a lot of money! I wonder where she rates on Hollywood's likability "q score"? I know Tom Hanks rates a 48, while Kim's is a -71, which is hilarious.</UTT>I've never heard of a q-score, but it sounds really interesting. I think most of the Kardashians are probably not good in relations to likability.</UTT>I would have to agree. I know critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous.</UTT>Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of actual talents. Just being wealthy and now famous. They are always coming up with new ways to stay in the spotlight.</UTT>Yes, I agree. Although she is reported to be the highest-paid reality personality of 2015 with her total earnings exceeding $53 million.</UTT>Yeah, I guess I would do some silly stuff like that if I was making that much money off of it. It was nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

Hey, how are you doing today?</UTT>I'm great.  How about yourself?</UTT>I'm doing pretty good, just trying to get rid of some hiccups. Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs?</UTT>No, I didn't know that.  How interesting.</UTT>I know! The correlation between our anatomy and animals is pretty neat. Did you know that the study of animals is called Zoology?</UTT>Yeah, I remember taking Zoology in school.  Did you know that there are over 7 million animal species?</UTT>That's pretty wild. I have recently learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth, that is astonishing!</UTT>That is amazing!  I was shocked to learn recently that there are some animals that can theoretically live forever, because they are biologically immortal.</UTT>Oh wow, that's really interesting. Did you know that in 2002 Germany became in the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights?</UTT>You know I had heard that and I also read somewhere that there is a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.  How wild is that?</UTT>That is pretty wild, I heard that under the provisions of the 1912 Scottish Protection of Animals Act that the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species!</UTT>Now that is wild.  Animals are so interesting to me.  I learned in college that they are like humans, they have a dominant "paw" or side.</UTT>They are definitely interesting. Did you know that they develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?</UTT>How cool, strange but cool, nonetheless.  I also learned that animals from geographically distant area often speak different"languages" or "dialects", just like people.</UTT>That's interesting. I wonder if my dog speaks with a southern dialect?</UTT>Mine most definitely does! I'm so glad that the world is appreciating and respecting the animals more.  I read somewher that the Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife.</UTT>I wish they would do that here. It breaks my heart seeing dead animals on the side of the road.</UTT>Me too.  The bridges connect habitats and keep the animals from being hit by cars.  Such a good thing that they do need to be constructed here.</UTT>That would help so much here, I don't see why they don't do it.</UTT>Agreed.  On a different note, I'm 50 years old and I just found out what the E. in Chuck E. Cheese stands for!</UTT>I have no idea what it stands for. I always thought it was Eugene or something like that.</UTT>Nope, you're wrong.  It's entertainment.  Charles Entertainment Cheese!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, friend.  I've got to get to work.  Talk to you later!</UTT>1

This whole topic is really tough. Moonves just got fired for cause and lost millions!</UTT>Sexual misconduct is a very serious charge and this must really affect the entertainment industry considering his role.</UTT>Yeah. I just am so sad for all the victims. It puts them in such a bad spot.</UTT>Having lots of power it must be hard for the victims to stand up to someone in such a position.  Harvey Weinstein stories of women set the bar high</UTT>Yeah... on . lighter note, When south park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew</UTT>That's a sweet gesture.  There are actually 750 episodes of Pokemon.  Have you seen any?</UTT>I have in passing... i have a 7 year old. How about you? Pokemon fan?</UTT>kids used to like it but outgrown I guess.  There is only one episode of the Simpsons without Bart</UTT>I did not know that... 70's show was remade verbatim in the uk. 'days like these' was cancelled after 10 episodes.</UTT>No woman was ever nominated for best cinematagrapher academy award.</UTT>Really, that has to be strange not have a women nominated. I feel like they should have been nominated, at least.</UTT>Yes, you would think.  Cinematographer Roger Deakins though has been nominated 13 times without a win for the best cinematographer oscar</UTT>When caesar visited britain, around 50bc, he noted that its people bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment</UTT>I wonder how they entertained? Bill nye seemed to entertain and he got a break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest.</UTT>Yeah... Ronald reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment executive didn't think he had "that presidential look."</UTT>That is funny!  The nintendo entertainment system was discontinued in 2003 in Japan.</UTT>Really? What about the switch. Seems weird.</UTT>Maybe that means the original?  It talks about the entertainment system only displaying 54 colors.</UTT>I did not know that. Only 54?</UTT>Entertainment like storytelling, music, drama, dance and other performances exist in all cultures</UTT>Nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

do you like cars?</UTT>Yes I do. Do you know when the drive thru was invented?</UTT>Yes that was back in 1975 by McDonald's</UTT>Yes and do you know why they invented it?</UTT>Yes because soldiers were not allowed out of cars in their fatigues</UTT>yeah. Do you know why the trunk of the car is called such?</UTT>Yes because old cars used to have wooden trunks</UTT>Yes. Do you know how cadillac got its name?</UTT>Yes if was after the founder of detroit, de la Mothe Cadillac</UTT>Yeah Do you know who Jonn Mardenborough is?</UTT>Yes he is the guy who became a professional driver by beating people to gran turismo</UTT>Yes he beat a staggering 90 000 people though</UTT>Yeah. In South africa you can put flame throwers n the car to protect it</UTT>Wow cool. Do you like the nba?</UTT>I sure do. Do you know who Kareem Jabbar is?</UTT>Yes he is the guy that used the dunk shot so much it got banned</UTT>Yeah that was crazy and for a good decade at it</UTT>Yeah.

Nice chatting with you.</UTT>1

What did you do today? I watched television.</UTT>I watched television as well I watched The Simpsons, so funny how homer keeps on switching jobs</UTT>I actually watched the Simpsons as well. Did you know that there is only ONE episode of the Simpsons where Bart isn't mentioned or even appears?</UTT>I didnt know that, I have to watch that episode it must be pretty rare, want a cool fact about The Simpsons?</UTT>Of course I do. You seem to know lots of cool facts about the Simpsons!</UTT>I really love the show that's why, well Homer had about 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes of the series, that means he had a different job every two episodes.</UTT>That's nuts. Do you like Pokemon also?</UTT>Yeah it just to be one of my favorite shows, Charizard and Pikachu are the best, do you like the show?</UTT>Absolutely love it. There are over 750 episodes for me to watch!</UTT>Yeah thats a lot of them, crazy fact about TV deals but most of them show the words 'shark tank' they seem kind of random</UTT>Yeah they do seem kind of random. Another show I really like is Family Guy. I think it's hilarious.</UTT>It is really funny, I like it a lot, seems like you enjoy comedy a lot</UTT>Oh yeah I do. I enjoy watching comedy central a lot.</UTT>I think that's a great channel I watched a movie with Drew Carey the other day, really funny.</UTT>Interesting! Fun fact, Comedy Central has canceled over 100 shows since they've been created.</UTT>That sucks, I bet many fans were upset because of this, kind of remind me of Netflix they have cancelled many of my favorite shows</UTT>Oh yeah for sure. I bet Netflix would be a lot more popular if they also showed some sports.</UTT>Yeah like baseball maybe, are you a baseball fan?</UTT>I am indeed! Baseball is so popular all over the world. It's even popular in Japan.</UTT>It is? I didn't think of Japan as a baseball fan country, did you know that a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from pro baseball after she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig?</UTT>It is! I guess it's SO popular in Japan, that many are surprised to discover that it's also popular in America.</UTT>Yeah well its been nice to chat, one thing to keep in mind next time you watch a game and that is that the opposing team will receive 3 bases if a player catches a ball in their hat</UTT>1

There are over 750 episodes for me to watch!</UTT>I think that's a great channel I watched a movie with Drew Carey the other day, really funny.</UTT>It is really funny, I like it a lot, seems like you enjoy comedy a lot</UTT>I actually watched the Simpsons as well. Did you know that there is only ONE episode of the Simpsons where Bart isn't mentioned or even appears?</UTT>Interesting! Fun fact, Comedy Central has canceled over 100 shows since they've been created.</UTT>I didnt know that, I have to watch that episode it must be pretty rare, want a cool fact about The Simpsons?</UTT>Yeah it just to be one of my favorite shows, Charizard and Pikachu are the best, do you like the show?</UTT>Yeah thats a lot of them, crazy fact about TV deals but most of them show the words 'shark tank' they seem kind of random</UTT>What did you do today? I watched television.</UTT>Of course I do. You seem to know lots of cool facts about the Simpsons!</UTT>Yeah well its been nice to chat, one thing to keep in mind next time you watch a game and that is that the opposing team will receive 3 bases if a player catches a ball in their hat</UTT>Oh yeah for sure. I bet Netflix would be a lot more popular if they also showed some sports.</UTT>I watched television as well I watched The Simpsons, so funny how homer keeps on switching jobs</UTT>That's nuts. Do you like Pokemon also?</UTT>Oh yeah I do. I enjoy watching comedy central a lot.</UTT>I really love the show that's why, well Homer had about 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes of the series, that means he had a different job every two episodes.</UTT>I am indeed! Baseball is so popular all over the world. It's even popular in Japan.</UTT>Yeah they do seem kind of random. Another show I really like is Family Guy. I think it's hilarious.</UTT>That sucks, I bet many fans were upset because of this, kind of remind me of Netflix they have cancelled many of my favorite shows</UTT>It is! I guess it's SO popular in Japan, that many are surprised to discover that it's also popular in America.</UTT>Well they probably had a general idea but made a lot of improvements. Like how quill dropped the orb in guardians of the galaxy and happened to catch it last minute.</UTT>0
hello!</UTT>Hello, did you know that the government shut down because of Trump?</UTT>I am very aware, it has been a crazy time with this President.</UTT>I agree. Speaking of presidents, the first president of Zimbabwe was dubbed banana. He must like bananas</UTT>Haha, that is an odd name for a president! It is as funny as the president in Indonesia that made 3 pop albums while he was in office....must have had a lot of time on his hands!</UTT>I know right? The president in Indonesia is like the asian version of Kanye West. Doesn't Kanye West want to run for president?</UTT>I have heard that on television that Kanye wants to run for president ...don't know how well that will work out but crazier things have happened! Almost as funny as how congress has a fantasy congress that they draft members of congress  lol....so much comedy :)</UTT>Wasn't he talking to Trump recently? He wants to make a difference in politics. Drafting members? That makes me think of basketball players getting drafted from one team to the next.</UTT>Yes, Kanye was in the White House visiting the president not too long ago, I watched the video on the television. It was very very crazy...Kanye had to shut down his social media accounts because of backlash.</UTT>I was curious why Kanye did that!!! Now I know why he stopped his social media!</UTT>Yep, it was really not good PR for Kanye. But I am sure it will blow over. Did you see on TV the State of The Union Address tonight by President Trump?</UTT>Oh I think so.</UTT>I was just curious I missed it, but I am sure there will be replays on TV later.</UTT>I do not plan to watch it. I only wait for the news for the results</UTT>Yeah, social media is already talking about it, I probably won't watch Tv tonight anyway lol. I have a couple Tv shows to watch, do you watch TV?</UTT>I do watch TV but not politics. I find it crazy that there are a lot of pokemon episodes beyond my expectation.</UTT>Yes, there have been over 750 episodes for 16 years. I don't know if it is still on tv....</UTT>It is on television. Also, they have it in Netflix as well. I love the first  season of Pokemon. Ash is still 10 years old to this very day.</UTT>Oh really? I didn't know if it was still on anywhere or if it was TV reruns. I watch The Simpson reruns</UTT>They should be on television reruns. Anyways, the Simpson reruns are only online, from my preference.</UTT>Oh, I watch them. It is also fun to watch That 70s Show, love it, one of my fav TV shows! It has been great chatting!</UTT>It was a great conversation!</UTT>1

I suspect that many animals can see color, just not like human beings For example, I expect that cats can see color as well.</UTT>Oh I think so.</UTT>0
Hi are you interested in television shows?</UTT>Hi! I am, actually! How about you? I love The Simpson's and there's actually an episode where Bart never makes an appearance nor is even mentioned that I still want to see. I bet it's weird never seeing Bart at all!</UTT>That would be different.  I've never seen that episode.  When South Park aired its Family Guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the Simpsons crew!</UTT>Wow! That was very nice of them! So we're you a fan of 70s Show? There was a UK remake I wanted to see but it only lasted ten episodes, sadly.</UTT>I was a fan and I've heard of that UK show.  It was called "Days Like These" and I haven't seen it either.</UTT>What gets me is Pokemon has over 750 episodes which is like 50 per year for 16 consecutive years yet the 70s Show remake only lasted ten episodes.</UTT>That's an insane amount of shows.  Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank?  Do you know who the 3 narrators were?  They all did it for at least 52 episodes each.</UTT>I heard it was George Carlin, Alec Baldwin and Ringo Starr, correct? I think that's pretty cool and I'd like to rewatch it just to see if I recognize their voices. Ha!</UTT>Nice!  You got them.  I remember George and Ringo, but not Alec.</UTT>I still think it's cool that they did that! They made a lot of kids' days! But I also enjoy watching shows about the Earth. In fact, I saw recently where the earth will pretty much be free of helium by the end of the century. I'm not sure  if that's a good thing or not.</UTT>I agree!  My kids watched it.  I'm not sure on the helium either.  I do know that people who like to suck it out of balloons and talk high pitched are not going to like it.</UTT>Ha! That is a good point as they certainly won't! But speaking of the earth, it's sad over 80% of our natural forests have been destroyed.</UTT>That is sad indeed.  I'm surprised to always hear about water shortages when 71% of the earths surface is covered with water.</UTT>Tell me about it. It's like, how is that possible? Did you know when the earth was formed that a day was only five and a half hours long? Imagine if that was the case today. We wouldn't accomplish anything!</UTT>lol No we wouldn't.  If Earths history were viewed in a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>And in that short time, we've already destroyed so much, sadly. But on a lighter note, did you hear about the UN appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials in the event they ever make contact with us back in 2010? I think that's pretty neat!</UTT>That is neat!  I wonder who it is?  Do you know when the first drive thru was added by McDonalds?</UTT>I heard it was added back in 1957 for soldiers who weren't allowed to exit their cars in fatigues. It's weird because I initially thought drive-thrus were always around. Ha! We've come a long ways since cars became widely available in the early 20th century, right?</UTT>I always thought like that too!  Just kind of always took them for granted.  It's been fun chatting with you!</UTT>What else I think is crazy that's car related is it's actually legal to equip your vehicles with flamethrowers over in South Africa in order to prevent carjacking. I'm glad I don't live there! Ha! Well it's been fun chatting with you as well, friend!</UTT>Me too!  Wouldn't catch me there.  Thanks!</UTT>1

Have you heard about the brouhaha in Panama City?</UTT>No I hadn't. It sounds quite crazy though.</UTT>I'm not sure I understand all of the story, but it sounds as if the conflict has international repercussions. Do you play an instrument?</UTT>I do not but I do own a piano.</UTT>The piano has an interesting history. It was invented by an Italian.</UTT>Yes and I think it is so simple yet complex how it makes sound caused from hammers striking the strings.</UTT>I guess before the piano the keyboard instruments plucked the strings. Why would someone put a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain? The eccentricity of the country knows no bounds.</UTT>Or how about a 356 pound grand piano on the lounge of an airship?</UTT>The one made out of aluminum? I wonder if it sounded tinny.</UTT>Probably! Piano music can be quite entertaining. In April 1930 the BBC broadcast piano music instead of reporting the news because it decided there wasn't anything newsworthy.</UTT>That was a pretty bold decision. I wonder whether any news station could get by with reporting a little bit less. They need to fill the time to keep the advertisers.</UTT>That is true. It was probably quite different back then though. Did you know there's a song just for stress testing auto-pianos?</UTT>I guess the song is needed because human beings can't impose enough stress on the machine. I've never heard the tune. I wonder who wrote it.</UTT>Good question. Have you ever tried to play?</UTT>No, I haven't. I don't have a musical bone in my body. I do better at video games.</UTT>I can find the notes and that's about it. Are you a car connoisseur?</UTT>I enjoy driving, but I don't have the money to make it a serious hobby.</UTT>My husband desperately wants to own a Cadillac. They are named after a french explorer.</UTT>Would you take a Cadillac to a McDonald's drive-thru? I guess you would if you were a soldier in uniform!</UTT>Ha, true! Course everyone does it now, soldier or not.</UTT>Great chat!</UTT>1

Hello there, do you enjoy watching comedy shows or movies?</UTT>Yes, I like comedies. How about you? Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is "the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy". What do you think?</UTT>Yes, comedy is one of my favorite genres to watch for sure.  I think Bill was just being sarcastic, but that's me.</UTT>I cannot say that I agree with Bill on that one. I haven't seen the film myself. What about Jack Black? Do you like him?</UTT>I saw about 5 minutes and that was enough for me.  Yeah I think he is pretty funny, how about you?</UTT>Jack is a natural comedian. The Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring Jack Black. I would like to have seen that version. I wonder what Bill Murray would have said.</UTT>That would have been very interesting if he did get that part.</UTT>Hard to guess what the execs are thinking when it comes to comedy. Awards shows too. 3rd Rock from the Sun won the Golden Globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.</UTT>Yeah that show was pretty good, but I've always been a Seinfeld fan, how about you?</UTT>Yes, I like Seinfeld quite a bit. Good thing he wasn't on Comedy Central. Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989.</UTT>That sounds like it was very hard to make the cut for that network wow!</UTT>Why hasn't South Park gotten canceled? LOL. I like that show. I figure they'll be around for a while more.</UTT>Yeah that show was really something when it first came out.  I remember my mom not letting me go to the movie lol.</UTT>It's pretty vulgar. What about Monty Python? Did you see that?</UTT>Yeah I used to watch all those old movies growing up.  Did you see the tribute they did for them?</UTT>I did not see that. When was that?</UTT>I guess whoever created the python programming language named it to honor them.</UTT>Good thing nobody put Python on the comedy channel or it would have been canceled.</UTT>Yeah that is probably true, good call.</UTT>Comedy Central. They should call Comedy Morgue. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day!</UTT>Yeah same here have a good one!</UTT>1

Hey there how's it going. Do you believe in aliens? Apparently there's a possible UFO sighting during the flight on February 24.</UTT>I find it interesting, apparently a pilot saw a UFO over the Arizona desert</UTT>There seem to be a lot of UFO sightings over Arizona. But it's not all clear with the pilot saw.</UTT>It's kinda creepy the control center in Albuquerque didn't record anyone passing the plane</UTT>Yeah I agree. Who knows what he saw. There have also been a lot of sightings in Nevada. Almost 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government. Maybe they are experimenting.</UTT>Possibly, the US government investigates some of the UFO reports</UTT>Yeah I would think that they would. I wonder if they have found anything? Sometimes I have a hard time keeping information classified like their plans to destroy WikiLeaks.</UTT>I don't know, but the pilot gave a pretty good description of the UFO hovering above his plane</UTT>Yeah that is kind of interesting it sounded like he said that there was an aircraft in the front and he reported something passing over him but he didn't get much more specific than that. Saying it could've been a balloon maybe, maybe not.</UTT>The pilot did say the object has a big reflection and doubted it was a balloon</UTT>Oh interesting. And it was troubling several thousand feet above them going in the opposite direction. Very interesting.</UTT>Yea, it's interesting they air control asked it was a Google Ballon. I didn't know google did that type of stuff, I just thought they stuck to online advertising and search engines</UTT>Yeah it seems like Google does a lot more than just work on their search engines. They also calculate traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.</UTT>That doesn't sound like Google gets accurate traffic results considering a lot of people don't use android phones</UTT>That's a good point. A lot of people rely on Google. In to 2013 google went down for about five minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it.</UTT>That's a shame. It's crazy that google tailors it's maps to the claims of each country when there is a disputed border</UTT>Yeah that is quite interesting that they do that. They also hire a lot of goats to trim their lawn instead of hiring people to mow it. That's kind of funny.</UTT>It's pretty funny a company whose search engine requires more computing power than sending a man to the moon would do that</UTT>Yeah that's a very good point I'd like to learn more about that. I wonder what Neil Armstrong and the other 11 astronauts think about that.</UTT>Idk, it's pretty crazy though, like the man who was able to sell the Eiffel tower twice</UTT>Yeah that must've been a huge accomplishment for him. I can't even imagine selling it once LOL. Are use Google so much though I am just happy it was founded back in 1998. Was nice chatting with you see you later.</UTT>1

Do you like to read?</UTT>I do. Do you?</UTT>I enjoy it.  It is so relaxing!</UTT>Ditto. Do you have a favorite genre?</UTT>I like non-fiction.  Usually self development, mindset, or business like books.  You</UTT>Surprisingly, the same. I am reading the first 90 days now. I am switching jobs and needed some help.</UTT>That sounds like a good one.  One of my favorites is the subtle art of not giving a f_ _ _.  If you dont mind profanity.</UTT>I don't. Who wrote that?</UTT>Mark Manson.  It is a great book about really living your best life regardless of what others think.</UTT>I'll have to check it out. Is it fiction or non-fiction?</UTT>Non fiction.  I am surprised its not on the military reading lists.  Far better than enders game.</UTT>There was a moral panic in the 18th century so be thankful we don't have that.</UTT>For sure.  Reading is so valuable no matter what genre.</UTT>I agree. The world record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute!</UTT>I dont know my rate, but for sure it isnt anywhere near that fast.  That might be 5-10 minutes I am guessing?</UTT>Mine too! I was told to start smart with working out so I don't push my brain too hard.</UTT>However I think the you laugh you lose, poetry reading could be a lot of fun!</UTT>Unless you are the one being laughed at. And it's not just some schmoes laughing. It Lewis and Tolkien!</UTT>I would have loved to witness that!</UTT>Yeah. I always wanted to party with a few authors. Hemmingway for sure!</UTT>He would probably be fun, same with Dr Suess.</UTT>Yeah... It was nice chatting with you!</UTT>1

Do you have a favorite genre?</UTT>Unless you are the one being laughed at. And it's not just some schmoes laughing. It Lewis and Tolkien!</UTT>He would probably be fun, same with Dr Suess.</UTT>There was a moral panic in the 18th century so be thankful we don't have that.</UTT>For sure.  Reading is so valuable no matter what genre.</UTT>I don't. Who wrote that?</UTT>Surprisingly, the same. I am reading the first 90 days now. I am switching jobs and needed some help.</UTT>I like non-fiction.  Usually self development, mindset, or business like books.  You</UTT>I agree. The world record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute!</UTT>Yeah... It was nice chatting with you!</UTT>Mark Manson.  It is a great book about really living your best life regardless of what others think.</UTT>I dont know my rate, but for sure it isnt anywhere near that fast.  That might be 5-10 minutes I am guessing?</UTT>0
Have you ever eaten popcorn with chopsticks?</UTT>No, how about you? Have you eaten it in any unconventional way?</UTT>No I have not.  But apparently you will find popcorn much more enjoyable if you do!  When you pay more attention to something enjoyable, they enjoy it more.</UTT>That's what the article said. I've thrown popcorn into the air and tried to catch it in my mouth. It did make eating popcorn fun. But I can't think of an unconventional way I've consumer water, can you?</UTT>There are lots of ways!  Shipping envelopes, pringles cans (though I prefer win those), even martini glasses.  Use your creativity!</UTT>I think I'd like to try an unconventional way to eat pizza instead. I don't think I would be very successful eating it with chopsticks, but blindfolded might be fun. Does that sound fun to you?</UTT>It could be - the restaurant which is pitch black could be interesting too - I have no idea how those waiters find the tables though</UTT>Ha, ha! So true! Did you enjoy learning the stuff about cars? I thought it was interesting why they call the trunk of your car a trunk. It seems so funny now!</UTT>Yes it does make sense.  I want to become a professional race car driver though - I am pretty good at video games</UTT>Are you really? I find driving in video games to be harder than driving on the road in a real car. I can see how it could help you with your driving skills.</UTT>Certainly there are a lot more obstacles to avoid in video games!  I rarely have boulders coming down the road at me.  Though the hardest part for teenagers is drive thrus</UTT>Thank goodness we don't have all those obstacles on the road coming at you! It's bad enough to get stuck in rush hour traffic!</UTT>Yes.  10 mph is easier to deal with than 100 for sure.  Though perhaps not in South Africa - where it is legal to have flame throwers on your car</UTT>Whoa! Don't mess with cars in South Africa! I think, though, I might like to try out that Dutch commuter bus they're creating that will travel at 160 mph.</UTT>Yes that does sound crazy!  I do want to travel to Europe - though Iceland does not have any trains - just airplanes to get from town to town</UTT>Europe would be fun. I don't think I would like to go to Iceland, trains or not, just because it sounds very cold!</UTT>Greenland is colder than Iceland!  Japan is expensive though - all of their highways are tolled</UTT>Yeah, that roll highway thing would be a pain in the neck! It would greatly increase your travel expenses. I think it would be cool to try out Mackinac island and travel the old fashioned way, by horse drawn carriages. That would be cool!</UTT>Yes a slow pace of life for sure.  I bet the Hawaiian king who was the first to travel the world had a slow pace of life as well.</UTT>It's funny, but the slow pace of life was how the world worked until recent times. Now we are very impatient, we want quick travel, instant access, all that.</UTT>Yes - and everything is online.  I could not live without my Reddit for social media.</UTT>1
