t_56767bf8-ad40-469b-b934-65bea519f11c</CONV>I saw that Bryce Harper is inline to make a ton of money, almost getting close to Alex Rodriguez.</UTT>Best news for him since those stupid "Make Baseball Fun Again" hats.</UTT>I remember when A-Rod was signing up, he go almost over $275 million in one year. Unreal</UTT>And now he's made $440 million altogether - so far. I wonder what he does with the bulk of his wealth?</UTT>I think some of these players spend a lot of their money relatively quickly. I'm not sure that Harper is worth it. I watch a lot of Nationals games.</UTT>How do you feel about Rendon getting let go from the team, then?</UTT>The negotiation with him went on for a long time if I remember correctly.</UTT>I'm a huge Yankees fan myself. Didn't know that the stadium was apparently good for left-handed people.</UTT>I've heard that. I've also heard the same thing about Boston's stadium.</UTT>Did A-Rod ever play for Boston? I forget...I know he bounced around earlier in his career,</UTT>I don't think he did to be honest. Harper had a terrible year last year, I think his average was around 250, which is really low.</UTT>Just like Washington Nationals fan to know that! Apparently, they (you) are very knowledgeable.</UTT>I didn't know that in Japan baseball could potentially be more popular than in the US.</UTT>I think they're the only nation that have better players than the U.S. Imagine if we had a real WORLD series?</UTT>That would be pretty interesting, also interesting is that managers of baseball teams can technically play for their team if the need arises.</UTT>I wonder if that's ever happened? Maybe when Sandy Koufax refused to pitch on Yom Kippur!</UTT>That's a name I have not heard for a long time. I think he played for both NY and LA.</UTT>Speaking of old players, if either of us had saved cards from back then (and been alive back then), we couldn't racked up 3 million dollars, like some guy did when he found a bunch of baseball cards from the early 20th century!</UTT>Crazy, baseball cards hold there value for some of the really older ones. Nowadays, I'm not so sure though.</UTT>I think rare Pokemon cards might be worth more in these days.</UTT>That's probably true, they publish way too many baseball cards now.
t_cb2dd8b0-2971-472a-96d4-356a678098e8</CONV>hey there my friend do you drive cars?</UTT>I do drive a car. Do you?</UTT>yes I have a jetta, do you ever go through the drive through?</UTT>I do. Do you?</UTT>yes I do, did you hear the history of the drive through</UTT>I have not. Do you know it?</UTT>ya, mcdonald's invented it actually, they made it for the soldiers in uniforms</UTT>Wow that was nice of them. I wonder when the trunk came into existence?</UTT>ya I don't know, but it sounds like a fire hazard to have a wooden trunk on a car back in the day</UTT>Plus if you had a flame thrower on your car, it was a recipe for disaster!</UTT>or a recipe for fun, depends on your perspective haha!</UTT>I read a story in maxim years ago about that and they also had huge swords that would cut the carjackers legs off. What would be the worse way to go?</UTT>haha well I think either way that sounds horrible, probably burning would be worse for me, what do you think</UTT>I think burning too. I can still function with no legs but to lose all my nerve ending and have months of rehab would be awful.</UTT>yup, plus I have seen burn victims and their faces and skin always make me sad</UTT>Did you know NYC's area code is 212 because it is the easiet to dial.</UTT>Haha I did, yes 212 is the fastest number you can dial on a rotary phone!</UTT>Did you ever have a rotary phone?</UTT>haha I've played with one, I only have a cell phone right now, what about you</UTT>Me too. I had a rotary growing up and it was the worst when you misdialed and had to start over or your finger slipped...</UTT>haha sounds horrible! what do you think of fish? I like to eat them</UTT>They are delicious smoked. Nice chatting with you!
t_ffefa8eb-c0fa-4062-97d4-b8428f9a95d9</CONV>Hello!  Do you use the internet a lot?</UTT>All the time!  How about you?</UTT>Same here.  I think I'm connected almost constantly when I'm home.  Did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button?  lol  I never knew that.</UTT>Me neither, my colleagues would refer to it as that.  I always just called it the menu button.</UTT>lol  Me too.  There is 3g cell service and internet capabilities at the peak of Mt. Everest.  That's amazing.</UTT>You know, so you can check in and Facebook your accomplishment.  LOL</UTT>lol That's funny!  Only 7 percent of people read the full terms when buying a product or service online.  Do you read the full terms?  I go over them but it looks like I'm in the minority.</UTT>I vaguely do, so Ive probably agreed to some sketchy stuff not even knowing it.</UTT>lol Did you know that the space shuttles general purpose computer only ran on 1mb of RAM.  Crazy.</UTT>Wow.  I think about what we have in the things we use for looking at pictures of cats and then something that important.  Crazy.</UTT>I know right?  lol  In 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran on water.  I didn't even know computers were around that early.</UTT>Neither did I , i wonder how powerful it was.</UTT>Not sure.  But it's an interesting concept.  Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks.  They must have been bored. lol</UTT>Really, that sounds like a lot of work.</UTT>I know.  lol  Technology has come such a long way that an iphone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent.  That's amazing and kind of scary at the same time.</UTT>It really is, I remember going to school and teachers saying we wouldnt have a calculator in our pocket everywhere we went....  looks like they were wrong.</UTT>LOL  You're right!  I remember my Texas Instruments calculator now that you mention it.  I thought that thing was so high tech and now it's worthless.  lol  On the subject of phones...Unicef has a program where they will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone.  I'm going to have to look more into that.</UTT>Same here, I could definitely put it down to help out a good cause.</UTT>Same here and seems like an easy cause to contribute to.  I don't use my phone that much.  A little early history on the rotary phone reveals that New York's area code was/is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.  Wonder why they didn't pick 121?</UTT>Or 111?  and why wasnt it given to the emergency department?</UTT>Good point!  I sure wouldn't have wanted to be the one who had to lay the phone and internet cables across the Oceans.  That had to have been one heck of a job.</UTT>I know that is a long way even if they are only 2.7 inches thick..   Its been nice chatting.  Have a good day!
t_b3090108-f3a8-4401-a790-e32f830efd76</CONV>Hello.  Do you remember the news story about a false missile alert in Hawaii last January?</UTT>Yeah that was crazy. The phone alert. And it specifically said it wasn't a drill-wow!</UTT>That was crazy!!  You would think that the government would have some redundancy in the system so that one person could trigger an alarm.  How do you respond?  Is the missile nuclear?  That is an egregious and unforgivable mistake!</UTT>Seriously! I would be so scared. I tink it's great to have a government to warn us of these things but it really shows anyone can make mistakes.</UTT>Again something that serious needs a fail-safe, like a 2-key system to activate in which the government officials are needed to activate.  Once that alarm is sent across the telephone, you can't take it back!  Following up with an "oops" message would lead to more chaos.  Government has its purpose, but often the bureaucracy trips over its own feet.  An then there are those who fake being government reps in scams!</UTT>Yeah good point. Do you think the government should have less control than it has now? The US government owns 86% of land in Nevada, I never knew that.</UTT>I knew that, but a lot of it is for military training and also contains uranium ore.  Outside of Las Vegas and Reno, the population is pretty sparse and scattered.   What do you think of WikiLeaks and its philosophy of exposing government secrets?</UTT>I think it was good and bad. The government obviously needs to keep certain information classified but other times they should be more transparent. I think wikileaks was a big gut check for the government to show them the importance of telling the truth and protecting classified info more carefully. The internet is a crazy thing.</UTT>Well, someone apparently leaked to WikiLeaks the government's plans to destroy WikiLeaks?  Hilarious.  I agree some things, mainly sensitive and strategic need to be classified, but I think it is abused too much for political purposes.  With the internet these days, once something is leaked, there is no pulling it back.</UTT>Exactly. The internet is even powerful enough to cause addiction that is measurable in the brain.</UTT>I got rid of my landline phone and go with cellular for personal / business and internet phone as my "office" phone or a psuedo landline.  So, no matter where I am, I am able to get calls and faxed on my internet phone number on my laptop.  Do you still use a traditional landline phone service?</UTT>Good idea! I do not. It's outdated and I only got soliciters calling me. No reason to have one anymore.  Especially since an iphone has more computing power than an entire nuclear icbm deterrent.</UTT>With a smartphone, you can do almost any common computer task.  I still use my laptop a lot because I have fat fingers and could never write a report on my smartphone even though it has the capabilities.  I like the way a smartphone can be turned into an internet hub.  That way, with my laptop, my office is anywhere.</UTT>haha. The phones are getting bigger and bigger though. Yeah that's a good point. The internet is everywhere now. And luckily the library of alexandria has saved a copy of the internet just in case.</UTT>Even Mt Everest has cell telephone and internet in case you want to send a selfie from the peak!!!  Do you do much shopping on the internet?</UTT>That would be epic. I shop on the internet quite often, much more convenient than having to go in the store. When buying stuff online I hate how they have that long page of terms and service. Apparently only 7% of people actually read them.</UTT>Because the terms can vary from vendor to vendor, I stick to a few sites I trust rather than buy from anyone on the internet with the best price.  Use to, you could shop on the internet tax-free.  Those days are gone with Amazon and others collecting sales taxes online.  Some of the things the government waste our tax dollars on are ridiculous, like a study of shrimp on a treadmill!!!  Yet, every now and then they do something good like Norway donating 1 billion to save the Amazon rainforest.</UTT>Yea it seems like every week research is contradicting itself. But one thing we should all agree on is saving the environment like Norway. That is so amazing. The government needs to focus more resources on that for sure.</UTT>Even nonprofits are challenging us to do more.  Did you know UNICEF has a program where they donate a day of clean water for every minute you don't use your cell phone?  I wonder how they figure that out?</UTT>Yeah that is also a great initiative. I think that is a positive note to end on! It was great talking with you have a great day!</UTT>Same to you, and I hope the government wises up and develops a more bulletproof plan to control the alerts they send to our phones and the internet so we do not have another HI scare, at least in my lifetime!
t_251ce44f-2d7c-4fcf-a80c-09efbd7398e9</CONV>Do you watch Daredevil?</UTT>I have seen it on Netflix, but haven't watched it, have you?</UTT>No, I haven't. I'm not really into superhero series. Though I thought Jessica Jones was okay.</UTT>I'm not either, I watched a few of the movies only because my husband wanted to. I see that Marvel comics created a superhero for a little 4 year old boy, the superhero "Blue Ear", because of the boy being uncomfortable to wear hearing aids, that was nice.</UTT>That is nice. Daredevil is on its third season so a lot of people must like it.</UTT>Yep, also Netflix accounts for 33% of internet bandwidth between the hours of 9pm to midnight in North America.</UTT>I am guilty for contributing to that. That is how I wind down. Netflix and Youtube together are half ofpeak internet traffic in North America.</UTT>I'm am a watcher as well, every evening.  Wow, Blockbuster declined the purchase of Netflix for 50 million years ago, now Netflix is worth 2 billion, bet they regret that one!</UTT>I'll bet. Netflix still spends more money on postage than bandwidth though. I forgot that they still offer DVD rentals.</UTT>I used to participate in the DVD rentals but it's just easier to rent or buy from Vudu or Amazon prime or something.</UTT>Yeah, I usually run out of content to watch for a few days but it gives me a little break. Then new content is available for me to stream. So I don't usually have use for the DVDs.</UTT>I agree, I think I've watched all the Thrillers on Netflix and Prime, ha. There was actually a comic book series that came out about fixing the collateral damage caused by superheros, funny.</UTT>Have you heard of a superhero called normalman? He was the only person who didn't have powers on a planet full of superheroes.</UTT>No, I haven't.  I will have to look him up, never heard of him. Talk about being the odd one out, bet he feel really insecure on that planet!</UTT>Yeah, it's an interesting concept. Apparently Daredevil's season three is really good. I might have to check it out.</UTT>Oh my goodness, there's actually over 300 registered superheroes in the United States!</UTT>That's quite a bit. I wonder how many are Marvel and DC.</UTT>Good question, will have to look that one up also!  Garfield had a book series spinoff named Pet Force, it featured him and his gang as Superheroes, funny!</UTT>I'd like to check that out. Garfield is hilarious.</UTT>I still enjoy watching Garfield and Scooby Doo.  I remember, staying up late at night with a flashlight, reading Superman and Batman comic books, when they were like, ten or fifteen cents!</UTT>Wow, that's amazing. What great memories.
t_39bde63b-f9ea-4670-b20f-ee5b82e70066</CONV>Hi, how are you?</UTT>I am well. Do you enjoy going to concerts?</UTT>I do, but sometimes they are overcrowded, do you go often?</UTT>Not as often as I used to. I prefer smaller venues rather than large stadiums or arenas. In croatia, there is an ancient roman amphitheatre that is still in use as a concert venue. That might be neat to attend!</UTT>I always see advertisements for them on facebook, do you use facebook often? I have been on for about 13 years!</UTT>Wow! I didn't realize it was only created in 2004- seems like it's been around forever!</UTT>I know, and in 2005, Myspace could have purchased it for 75 million, if only!</UTT>Seriously! Their initial IPO in 2012 valued them at $104 Billion!</UTT>I have heard the creator of facebook is red-green colorblind, so the logo is blue!</UTT>That is an interesting fact. In Iceland, they are using Facebook to rewrite their constitution and the public can make suggestions. Pretty cool!</UTT>Facebook seems very interesting in that sense, Burger King had a promotion to unfriend people for free food!</UTT>Haha. There are a couple people I would unfriend even without the free food! There is a state in Germany where the "like" button is illegal!</UTT>Why do you think that is the case?</UTT>I have no idea! I didn't realize Facebook was named after the facebook directories often given to American university students. I never had one of those in College.</UTT>I guess zuckerburg had a better idea since he went to Harvard, what a great school!</UTT>I didn't realize facebook was initially just for Harvard students.</UTT>I guess that makes sense on a test scale kind of thing, but that is pretty interesting!</UTT>Now anyone over 13 can join! 13 seems pretty young</UTT>That is way too young in my opinion, it is too easy to contact children, and that is not a good thing</UTT>Too many creeps out there. I did hear the age requirement varies based on local laws though.</UTT>That is good, but laws are so slow to adjust for the change of technology I think
t_e07b45e4-97a7-4838-9e99-ae092d0764bd</CONV>hi, do you watch the NBA?</UTT>Hi! Yes I'm excited for March Madness. I don't have a favorite team though, do you?</UTT>No I do not have one either. do you know who reggie miller is?</UTT>Yes, though I often confuse him with Reggie Bush, but Miller is the basketball guy. Anything he's famous for?</UTT>Well, he is a superstar but his sister was always better</UTT>Does his sister play for the WNBA?</UTT>I am not sure, maybe. She broke 8 national records once</UTT>Wow! That's no easy accomplishment. Same thing with Allen Iverson! He was so smart to sign a lifetime contract with Reebok to pay him $800K a year until he reaches age 55 and he'd get a lump sum of $32 million, talk about a great retirement fund!</UTT>THey can make so much money sometimes. Do you know who TIm Duncan is?</UTT>Yes! I used to really like him, does he still play for the Spurs?</UTT>I think he has retired maybe I am wrong. But apparently he decided to stay in college and finish before going to the NBA</UTT>Oh wow, I think he's one of the few! But seeing that they can make millions from endorsements, I guess they don't need to. Like Lebron James who rejected a $10 million offer and accepted a $90 million from nike years later.</UTT>Smart businessman for sure. Do you know what granny styl eis?</UTT>Yes! Of course! I wish pro basketball players made the granny style shot famous, I want to see someone incorporate that technique during one of the games.</UTT>Yeah and to think that the only reason they do not do tjat is because it looks funy. who cares, just score</UTT>Yeah! You think the name is what makes it embarrassing for the masculine players to use it? Even physicists have proved that granny style is the best technique!</UTT>Yeah exactly. Do you watch much tv?</UTT>Yes, I enjoy watching TV, my favorite genre to watch are dramas, how about you?</UTT>Yeah I like them. Did you ever watch House?</UTT>I used to watch it all the time and it's crazy to think about how someone who portrays a doctor make more than actual doctors! I think he made over $700K per episode!</UTT>Man he has made so much money but it was a good show for sure. nice chatting with you
t_4c647b8a-fa31-4b25-9f26-d6d9484a9c13</CONV>Hello! Do you like lady gaga?</UTT>Yeah I think she is fascinating. The movie she did with Bradley Cooper was great.</UTT>I haven't seen it, but I do like that song from it! Her name came from the predictive text glitch that changed radio to lady! Interesting!</UTT>Very interesting. A star is born is good you should watch it. It was Bradley Cooper's directorial debut.</UTT>I will definitely check that out! Her favorite band is Iron maiden, I wouldn't have guessed that!</UTT>I wouldn't have guess that either. She apparently has a 11.4 million followers on Twitter.</UTT>That seems more assumable! She was also asked by the lapd to tweet them about some roadwork once!</UTT>Oh wow I have never heard of followers being used like that. Elton John chose Lady Gaga as his son's godmother. I didn't know they were close.</UTT>I didn't either! Do you remember the show boiling points on MTV? Lady gaga was on it before she was famous.</UTT>Yes I vaguely remember that show. I will have to look it up. She's one of the best selling music artists in history now. I bet she reminisces on those boiling point days.</UTT>Absolutely! Speaking of famous artists, Queens guitarist has a phd in astrophysics!</UTT>Yeah I remember that from the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, did you see it? He also uses coins as guitar picks.</UTT>I didn't see that one either, i'm really behind on movies it seems! The guitarist for muse hold a world record for most guitars smashed on a tour!</UTT>Yes I recommend that movie as well. Wow that must be a lot. Eddie Van Halen set a studio speaker on fire once!</UTT>That's crazy! Pink floyd turned a grand houseboat into a floating recording studio. That sounds awesome!</UTT>That sounds very awesome. I bet the river Thames has never seen such a party!</UTT>I bet! Linkin park played 324 concerts in 2001 alone.They must be busy people!</UTT>Wow very busy indeed. It must be nice to have such a successful debut album.</UTT>Yeah, they were pretty popular in the early 2000s. The ramones have played a total of 2263 concerts!</UTT>That is also a lot of concerts. I like going to concerts but the loud amplified sound of the electric guitar is very deafening. Thanks for talking with me this afternoon.</UTT>Yeah, it can get pretty loud! It was nice chatting with you!</UTT>Have a great afternoon. Bye!
t_1512299c-eef4-4cf3-b6de-0bac7db4c4a8</CONV>Hello</UTT>Hi, how are you? Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Mostly you tube on my phone. I used to listen to the radio a lot more.</UTT>I listened when I was a kid. Not now. I use a computer.</UTT>Yeah. Im using my computer right now.</UTT>There is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free. I wonder who visits that site. Probably an older generation.</UTT>I think it might be kind of cool to listen to a couple of them.</UTT>There are probably some good stories in there. Would you listen to the news in Latin though?</UTT>Nope. I couldnt understand it. Maybe I would if I was trying to learn latin.</UTT>Since 1989 a Finnish radio station has broadcast 'Nuntii latini' - a weekly news program conducted entirely in classical Latin</UTT>Did you know they made radios while fighting in WW2</UTT>I would expect the troops used radios in WW II. They needed to communicate.</UTT>They made their own radios using a razorblade and a pencil as the diobe</UTT>That is quite clever. Necessity is the mother of invention. I couldn't do it myself. I wonder what they could pick up.</UTT>Probably am radio or a bunch of german stuff</UTT>I wonder if they could hear the storms on Jupiter.</UTT>not sure. did you know that a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the sun</UTT>The surface of the sun is probably much cooler than the interior. I wonder if we could harness that lightning energy.</UTT>Yeah that or harness the suns rays effeciently.</UTT>The sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500 000 years. I wonder how much of that we could capture, and where would store it.</UTT>i think solar needs a lot of work then.</UTT>Solar has a lot of promise. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!</UTT>Me to. TTYL.
t_63d12a49-20f2-4138-97a9-c0beb1179342</CONV>Hi. You hear about that shopping mall who hired a hawk to rid itself of the pigeon problem?</UTT>Hello, how are you? I did not hear about the shopping mall that hired a hawk to rid itself of a pigeon problem.</UTT>Yeah they used it 12 days a month and it decreased the pigeons from a few dozen to just a few!</UTT>That is great! The hawk was a terrific hunter! I would hire that hawk to get rid of my neighbors!</UTT>Haha me too. Birds are great. Some birds can migrate from alaska to mexico!</UTT>I figure that I could too if I had enough time. But I would have to sleep on the way. I couldn't stay away. The trip is too boring.</UTT>Yes good point. Most birds have hollow wings.</UTT>I think that the bones are hollow because they are lighter. Coincidentally, they are also stronger. My skull doesn't work the same way though.</UTT>Yes neither does mine! The only known bird without wings are the extinct moa and the elephant birds.</UTT>The moa and the elephant bird? What is an elephant bird? And how big are its poops? Good thing it didn't fly!</UTT>Good question but I'm not sure. Hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct their nests!</UTT>I think that hummingbirds are thieving birds! Why must they take from the humble spider, our friend?</UTT>Haha yes they must love the web. They are not considered mans best friend like a dog is.</UTT>Dogs do not steal spider webs either. I appreciate their integrity.</UTT>Me too. Dogs are not color blind but they can't see as many colors as us.</UTT>I am proud of my color seeing abilities, but dogs can hear and smell better than me. I think that dogs are a great addition to any war party.</UTT>Yep absolutely right. I think it's cool how dogs were bred from wolves!</UTT>I think that we have found a true friend in dogs. I think that the wolves are jealous of our friendship with the dogs. They should be. Dogs have it pretty sweet.</UTT>Yea no doubt about that. Dogs perform many roles too from hunting to herding to friendship!</UTT>I think that they should help us with financial advice and taxes more. Anyway, great chat! Woof!</UTT>Yeah and remember google is also a dog company! You too bye!
t_aada0ee4-058a-4e05-9d11-a050af7aae9b</CONV>Hi! Are you a dog lover?</UTT>Hey there do you like horror movies? Can you believe that Stephen King thinks Bambi is a horror movie? It's a really sad movie but I wouldn't say it's scary</UTT>A horror film?  Well, if horror films help you burn more calories, it is nice to think that watching Bambi is apart of a good diet plan!</UTT>Haha that's a good plan! And sorry I missed your first question, I do like dogs a lot. I need a dog so that I can go on walks to burn calories, and then we can watch horror movies together to cuddle and I will also burn calories doing that LOL</UTT>Nice! Did you know, if you watch a horror film before you go to the museum, it will help yo appreciate abstract art better?  But don't take your dog tot he museum! They have a different response when they see a 65 millioon year old dinosaur skeleton. They think, bones!  Thank you God!</UTT>LOL ok I'll make sure not to do that, also I feel bad, at least they are not colorblind but they definitely can't see as many colors as humans can, that is weird</UTT>It is God's way of trying to even the playing field. The dog can smell better, run faster, jump higher, and hear better than we can. But at least we can see more colors.</UTT>Haha well I like that too. I also like that Google prefers dogs to cats. They put that in their company policy which is amazing, that's why I like Google LOL</UTT>Nice! Google is awesome, but dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing, so Google made agood choice in not making elephants their official animal of choice. They would need biger offices!</UTT>Haha that seems so interesting. Why don't gorillas know what pointing is? Wouldn't you think that they would LOL? They're so smart and everything. but we should do what is stanbul does with stray dogs, have you heard about that?</UTT>Yes, their vending machines for dog food in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. Nice idea. I might start doing that with breakfast cereal.</UTT>Haha you should do that! Dogs are so cool though, I love how they have dog blood drives, it's crazy that there are 12 different dog blood types, do you think that they get treats once they give blood?</UTT>I do. It is only fair that they do also, although my dog doesn't care for orange juice. I try to explain to the dog that 80% of the earth's rain forests are gone, so don't knock the orange juice until you try it, but my dog still doesn't get it...</UTT>Haha such a poor doggo. that is sad that all that Forest is gone, also weird that we will run out of helium by the end of the 21st century, what will all the balloon stores use to fill up the balloons?</UTT>Flatulence, of course. I explained this concept to my dog, but he would not fart in a balloon for me.  In frustration, I exclaimed that if earth's history was one 24-hr day, then human history would only be 1 minute and 17 seconds. My dog responded, then why does it take you over two minites to refill my bowl?</UTT>Haha you need to create a store that sells dog fart balloons LOL I guarantee you someone would buy them haha. What do you think about the un Ambassador that they have ambassador to extraterrestrials must have a really lonely job lol</UTT>Yeah, and training for an impending invasion is difficult. Like how many times can one person watch the movie, Mars Attacks?  And if Earth is the densest planet in our solar system, why would any sensible alien want to stop off and speak to dense earthlings anyway?</UTT>Haha I agree with you. Nice job bringing up Mars Attacks too, that's a movie I haven't thought about in a long time haha. That is almost a horror movie, I will be able to burn the 180 calories if I watch that again. Have you ever seen the movie The Shining by the way</UTT>Yes. A nice film you can watch with the whole family. You just can't let them know that it is a horror film until they grow up... like they did with the actor that played the role of little Danny!</UTT>I know right! I'm so happy that he didn't know he was in a horror movie. That would definitely have messed him up. Have you heard of a water phone? And no, it's not a phone that runs on water LOL</UTT>No, what is a water phone? This isn't some joke about how 71% of the earth is covered with water, so you are bound to reach  water even by telephone?</UTT>Haha I wish it were a joke. But it's an instrument actually. It makes that weird creepy metallic noise that you hear in horror movies. Maybe I should buy one LOL

That's a lot of episodes.</UTT>Its like 16 years of episodes !</UTT>Apparently, most deals made on the shark tank show are never enacted.</UTT>Thats sad,  what a fake tv show then.</UTT>I think it is.  I watch it from time to time when nothing else is better.</UTT>Do you like to travel?  I hear the dutch are making a high speed commiuter bus that travels 160 mph</UTT>Yes, I do.  I went to Netherlands twice.  That bus is too fast for me.  I do not plan to ride on it.</UTT>Oh really lol I would definitely try it.  In Japan,  crossing the country will take $300 in tolls!</UTT>I cannot afford that.  I will take trains instead.</UTT>Right,  not to mention I will have a hard time driving on the opposite side of the road.</UTT>I heard that there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you are traveling.  Do you know about the website?</UTT>yeah I think its called couchsurfing.com or something like that.  I have never used it though.  i wouldnt mind though!</UTT>I do not like to stay at strangers' houses.  I have never stayed at airbnb either.</UTT>Oh wow,  Ive stayed in a lot of airbnb and even a hostel.  I dont mind it,  especially if I need to save money for more important traveling expenses.</UTT>I'm female and old.  So, I'm not as courageous as young people.</UTT>Fair enough.  Its been great chatting with you,  thanks for the conversation.
t_ff9bb6ed-26dc-4578-b96d-c444114b207d</CONV>Hello, are you interested in Cricket?</UTT>Hello.  I think Cricket is interesting although I have never played.  I think it is one of the only games I can think of that has 11 players on a field at a time.</UTT>Yes, sounds interesting that the players of the batting side score runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat while the bowling and fielding side try to prevent this and dismiss each player so that they are 'out'.</UTT>That is interesting. I meant to say that each team has 11 players on the field at a time.  I didn't know there was International Cricket Council.  Did you?</UTT>Yeah, I heard about that.  I also heard that there's an all US born Cricket team from Compton that won the British cup twice.</UTT>That is awesome!  It seems like Australia does very well in cricket considering they have won 45% of all world cups.</UTT>Not only that but the Australians have also appeared in 63% of all finals and have won 71% of their final appearances.</UTT>I had heard that somewhere.  However, apparently both England and Australia had diplomatic consequences for using nasty tactics against history's best cricket player.  It sounds like this game can get serious.</UTT>Apparently, it can get nasty and go for a really long time as well. The longest match in the history of cricket was in 1939 England playing against South Africa that took part in a single match that lasted 14 days.</UTT>That would be a really long match.  I wonder if people stayed to watch.  Some cricket players have interesting names like the professional Indian cricket player Napoleon Einstein.</UTT>I thought that was cool too. They keep playing until ten players have been dismissed, then the innings end and they sway roles. That 14 day game must have been exhausting for the players. They probably had extra players coming in from each side to pull that off.</UTT>They must have been.  I think it is interesting that the game of cricket spread globally when the British Empire expanded.</UTT>I think a game close to Cricket is played in most other countries except the US where football reigns in the sports arena as the national pastime.</UTT>Football is extremely popular in America which is probably why those with successful careers in sports are often associated with celebrity status.</UTT>Yes, that's certainly true. Celebrity status is often associated with wealth referred to as fame and fortune, while fame more often provides opportunities to earn revenue. Football certainly lends itself well to that aforementioned celebrity status.</UTT>I think it is interesting that as popular as football is that LeBron James is the highest paid celebrity followed by Judge Judy,</UTT>Agree on that, too. Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode. Wow, I wonder just how much Lebron James rakes in then?</UTT>Right!  I can't believe that.  Celebrities also get special perks like a secret room at Pixar studio that they can visit.  I wonder if Judge Judy or Lebron James ever visits there.</UTT>Good question. They both have probably been there!  Celebrity status gives many perks that common people would never know about.  I know that Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street. I bet that was a real honor for Elmo and the rest of the gang!</UTT>Yes.  She is pretty funny.  Speaking of funny actors, Robin Williams started the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films in Aladdin.</UTT>Yes, he was such a funny guy. Other countries also have celebrities too. Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who thinks he can combat his country's hunger problems by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods.
t_82ea50c1-6e12-4450-a8dd-e656658b0df8</CONV>Have you ever heard of the book "the book of lists"? it was published back in 1977</UTT>I may have. I'm guessing from the title that it's full of lists of varying categories?</UTT>Haha I don't know for sure but that is a good guess lol. I don't know why people would read lists in a book though, when you could read them on the Internet, do you ever use the internet</UTT>I actually love lists ha ha. Yes I use the internet constantly.</UTT>If you use it constantly, have used the hamburger button before?</UTT>I'm not sure. What is a hamburger button?</UTT>It's a menu button, it looks like three horizontal lines, I think that Reddit has it on their website actually</UTT>I do know that button. I have used it a lot. I had no idea it had a name. Were you aware that on the international space station astronauts have faster internet connection than most Americans?</UTT>No I didn't know about that I wish I had their internet though LOL. Do you ever read the terms of service when you use the internet by the way</UTT>I am super guilty of not reading them.</UTT>Yep me too. Would you ever climb Mount Everest by the way? It's good to know that they have 3-g service at the peak</UTT>I'm amazed that you can get internet there. I wonder how that's possible. I'm still not climbing it though ha ha.</UTT>Yeah the internet really is amazing, it's shocking that the Library of Alexandria actually runs a backup of the internet in case it ever goes down, that must be a huge file LOL</UTT>I can't imagine how much storage space that would take!</UTT>I wonder to how many people have the internet addiction in terms of clicking links, I probably do myself LOL</UTT>I have definitely been down several internet rabbit holes myself. Do you know what the act of looking yourself up on the internet is called?</UTT>I think it's called ego surfing right? I have definitely done that at least once or twice haha. Do you like dogs by the way</UTT>It is. I love dogs. I love all animals actually.</UTT>Well I didn't know about dogs that they have twelve different blood types, did you know that? They also do dog blood drives</UTT>I had no idea. I'm glad they do the drives because that means they would need a lot of blood to save lives with that many different types.</UTT>Yes I agree I just hope they get a cookie after the drive LOL. I even like knowing that Google is officially a dog company because they put that in their code of conduct
t_7145b80a-507a-4003-ade1-02783dbda2e5</CONV>I just found out that both Curry and Lebron are both from the same city - Akron, Ohio! That's crazy!</UTT>I am huge fans of both of theirs!</UTT>Yeah, I had no idea! I'm not a huge fan, but I can enjoy the odd game! Who do you root for?</UTT>I always root for Golden State and Steph.</UTT>That's pretty cool! I was so surprised to find out that Curry doesn't get the highest salary though, not even close!</UTT>No he doesn't but he does have what could end up being a one billion dollar deal with Under Armour.</UTT>Oh, Absolutely! I understand that Nike tried to sign him, but they did a terrible job; even had Durant's name on the presentation.</UTT>I saw that story!  That was insane and a complete show of incompetence!</UTT>Yeah, it's crazy the money that goes into these things! Even when you're losing games, teams make money from the promotional/ad stuff</UTT>Do you know his dad was in the NBA as well?</UTT>Yeah, his dad was wardell, right? And so curry is actually Wardell Stephen Curry II?</UTT>Yeah but he was called "Dell" for short. He is usually at the games.</UTT>Yeah, I guess it's a family event for some! Just like Reggie Miller with his sister!</UTT>His daughter always seems to steal the spotlight though...lol</UTT>I know, it's crazy! He scores 40 points, she scores 105! Like how do you even outscore that?!</UTT>I meant that she is so cute that everyone notices her more than Steph.</UTT>Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood. You mean Curry's sister?</UTT>No, I was talking about Curry's young daughter.</UTT>Oh, I see! That's sweet though! So is she into basketball too, like him?</UTT>She can be quite funny in front of the media and the camera!</UTT>That is so awesome!! Is she somehow involved with the foundation Curry's a part of? That donates mosquito nets?</UTT>Yep, 3 nets per 3-pointer. That is so wonderful of an idea.
t_cd27d060-db16-421f-98bb-be8e5db9f150</CONV>What do you enjoy for entertainment?</UTT>I enjoy catching up on news and listening to music, though I've only recently dabbled into jazz music. Yourself?</UTT>I enjoy jazz as well, especially how it kept its core but absorbed local musical culture to derive distinctive styles</UTT>Yeah, but Hitler once suppressed jazz which he condemned as "degenerate" because of its association with Jewish and black composers and musicians, I'm happy we've come a long way since then!</UTT>Did you know henry ford also tried to suppress jazz by financing country music instead for the very same reason that it was urban decadence.</UTT>Wow! I didn't know that, really interesting how there's geographical differences in jazz music, like New Orleans Jazz, Kansas City Jazz, Gypsy Jazz, I wonder if I'd be able to tell the difference. Would you be able to?</UTT>Jazz is still jazz. They are distinct, but similar at the core</UTT>I see, I wish I could sing like Jazz's great Ella Fitzgerald who even taught herself how to sing 2 notes at once at the age of 18!</UTT>Given your interest in jazz, what instrument do you play?</UTT>I used to play the guitar but quit when one of my strings broke and just gave it up, do you play any instruments?</UTT>Did you play by hand, with a pick, or a coin? I dabbled here and there with piano and violin</UTT>I didn't know you could play by coin! I strummed it with my fingers  or with a pick. There's a very tiny guitar, the size of a red blood cell that was built by Cornell researchers, it needs to be played via laser. I wonder why they invented that.</UTT>Probably just because they could</UTT>It's amazing the mechanics of things that goes to make sounds, Brian May of Queen built his own guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother's knitting needle, I'd say ouch</UTT>I wonder how it sounded. On a sperate note, eddie van halen set his speakers on fire when he soloed beat it</UTT>Wow, that can happen? Was it an accident or was it for entertainment purposes?</UTT>I think because of the music, he taxed the speakers till it burst into flames. At least he didn't intentionally destroy instruments like matthew bellamy who holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed on tour</UTT>Yeah, I think that could get very expensive but small price to pay for the entertainment revenue it brings in. Like the Olsen twins purchased an entertainment company back in early 2000s and have turned it into a billion dollar company! No wonder I don't hear about them anymore.</UTT>True these people are very dedicated. The guitarist of pink floyd even made a floating recording studio</UTT>Maybe that's what it takes to get the perfect vibrato sound when he records. Were any notable records produced on that floating studio?</UTT>Not sure, but it is called the astoria. Well thanks for chatting, I hope you also had a good time.
t_0c0bf1a6-e506-4c73-a834-e27f73d28912</CONV>Do you like Fifth Harmony?</UTT>I have not heard of it. What is it?</UTT>They are a band, they sing "Work From Home."</UTT>Seems like they are taking their own advice and taking a break, while they work from home.</UTT>yeah, it is not a bad idea. Everyone gets burned out sometimes.</UTT>What kind of music do they play? Is that the band that Diddy created?</UTT>I think it is like pop/rap, pretty good stuff.</UTT>Is it anything like Psy's gangnam style? That got so many views that they had to upgrade the view counter to integer to 64 bits.</UTT>No, but I do like the gangnam style. Did you know youtube is the second largest search engine on the net?</UTT>Behind Google? Huh... Doesn't google own YouTube? Seems logical if they do own it. YouTube and Netflix make half of peak internet traffic.</UTT>Crazy isn't it? Yeah they do. Justin Biebers song is the most disliked song on youtube. Hilarious!</UTT>Why they hatin on Biebs.... I hate to admit that if one of his good songs come on, I will jam to it. But it;s only like 2 songs and neither are baby.</UTT>I don't honestly know any of his music.</UTT>HA! Now I feel like a loser. Well let me redeem myself. Did you know Floyd recorded a live album at Pompeii with no one there?</UTT>No, I was unaware, where the volcano went off?</UTT>Yeah. Do you like Pink Floyd?</UTT>They are ok. I haven't listened to them in a long time though.</UTT>What about Creed. Do you listen to them</UTT>Yeah, they are ok, but I hear they are bad live.</UTT>Yeah. Like get sued by your fans, bad!</UTT>Yeah, hilarious. Nice chatting with you.
t_c771eeef-d87f-47eb-96fb-08fef6f569e1</CONV>Hey there what do you think of our current system of government? I was shocked to learn that Nevada is mostly owned by the US government</UTT>Yeah all 86% of the land, I wonder what they do with it really</UTT>I know right. Although I do know that Nevada is mostly desert, but still. Did you hear about the Man Who Sold the Eiffel Tower twice? That was risky.</UTT>Haha I wonder how he got away with it twice. Do you know what wikileaks is?</UTT>I have heard of WikiLeaks. Didn't they publish plans that the government was trying to destroy them? That's so insane</UTT>yeah, they must have an inside man. Did you hear about the Norwegian government's plan to save the rainforest?</UTT>No I didn't what did they do? I did hear that the u.s. Passed a law that would protect government employees from being persecuted if they violated the Geneva Convention though, that seems really weird</UTT>Yeah tha is weird and the Norwegians donated $1 billion, that is a whole lot of money.</UTT>I know right! How often do you travel by the way? Have you ever been to Norway?</UTT>I have not actually but would like to visit at some point. In Iceland as well but would have to get a car</UTT>Well apparently Iceland doesn't have public service rails, and so you just fly between cities, so maybe you don't need a car LOL</UTT>Yeah if that makes it cheaper sure. Or maybe they will get one of those Dutch buses that go 160 mph</UTT>Haha I would definitely ride that. What I wouldn't ride is a highway system in Japan. All of them are private and all have tolls</UTT>Yeah and it would cost you $300 to travel the country</UTT>Yep exactly. That sounds really annoying. Have you ever been to Mackinac Island in Michigan?</UTT>I have never but would like to go how that works without any motorized vehicles, must be so peaceful there</UTT>Oh I agree with you. But it also smells like horses everywhere haha. I have been there and there are no Cars, just horses.</UTT>Yeah I guess that might be the downside. DO you know who was the first king to travel the world?</UTT>Wasn't at the king of Hawaii? I wonder what made him do it. What do you think?</UTT>Yup that was him. I am not sure though why he did it. Did you know that Venus does not tilt?</UTT>Wow I didn't know that. I miss Pluto is a planet by the way! Also apparently Venus rotates clockwise
t_e2eab940-440e-4924-9d58-bd5d99240cad</CONV>Do you ever play video games?</UTT>I do not but my son plays them, he'd play more if I let him.</UTT>Mine does too!  Constantly if I would let him! He loves to play fortnite which is a multiplayer game</UTT>That is my sons drug, I mean game, of choice.  He's played a bunch of other video games but Fortnite is the one that he'll play if he were allowed just one.</UTT>Yep! Mine is addicted too. Did you know that the first multiplayer first person shooter used a music protocol for networking?</UTT>I did not know that, and now you say it I have to admit I don't really know what that means.  Do your have phones yet?</UTT>Do we have phones? We all have cell phones.</UTT>That's what I meant, my son wants a cell phone but we haven't let him yet, he's in fifth grade, but we'll have to get him one soon, most of his friends have them.</UTT>Yep. I have a seventh grader and a senior in high school so they have phones. We got my youngest one at the end of 5th grade since he was moving up to middle school. Did you know that NY area code is 212 because it is the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. Not like that matters anymore!</UTT>Why does New York get  to choose?  I work in a school, the kids are on the phones at every opportunity, but I suppose that is the modern world.  Just like Netflix has replaced Blockbuster</UTT>They are on them constant. How about how blockbuster declined to buy netflix for $50 million. It is now worth $2 billion. Not so smart in hind sight.</UTT>Someone must be kicking themselves, like the person that turned down the Beatles before they made it.  We cut our cable about two years back, don't miss it in any way.</UTT>It is so expensive. I would rather have Netflix. Did you know that Netflix and youtube make up half the peak internet traffic in North America. I don't doubt it.</UTT>I can well believe it, if I think of how I use the internet, mainly to watch Youtube or Netflix.</UTT>I think it is funny how netflix came about. All because of a $40 late fee for apollo 13 it was started.</UTT>They always don't upset your customers.  I understand that there are still one or two Blockbusters in Alaska, where the internet is as widely available.  It's still, probably, just a matter of time.</UTT>Yep.  I bet Alaska is way behind the times. Plus the internet capabilities may not be that great since it is such a huge area.</UTT>I wonder how there cell phone coverage is there.  Maybe the kids in Alaska aren't as addicted to their phones and social media.</UTT>You could only hope!  I can't pry my kids away from their electronics. Not a good thing.</UTT>The kids are getting sneaky too,  It's hard to stay ahead of them, with these fake apps and secondary social media pages.  My kids are already too clever for me.</UTT>So are mine. And Snapchat is the worst!  good talking to you today!! Have  a good day.</UTT>Same here, have a good day. Bye.
t_aabe29d8-b222-402f-b99a-b37588a908ea</CONV>Hey have you ever seen the movie Isle of dogs? It was directed by Wes Anderson</UTT>Is that the one where dogs are fighting on an island?  It seemed a bit sketchy for a kids movie</UTT>Yes that's the one. It's actually not a bad movie, I liked it and it's rated PG-13, there's not too much violence or anything from what I saw</UTT>Yes but there was definitely language in it that was not for children!</UTT>Yes there is also a reference to dogs being in heat, which is kind of weird because it is Clay animation, but I think kids will be ok watching it</UTT>Yeah I will have to check it out.  Any movie with dogs cannot be all bad?  After all they are mans best friend</UTT>They are. There are also about 12 different dog blood types, I wonder if there are blood drives for them</UTT>Yes animals in surgery need blood too!  Did you know Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog?</UTT>No I didn't know that what did that dog do? I also didn't know that dogs are not actually colorblind they just can't see all of the colors that humans can</UTT>Right.  Which is good because there are dogs in Moscow who ride the subway and without colors it might be hard for them to tell what line to get on!</UTT>Yeah that's possible. Why do you think only dogs and elephants can understand pointing though? I wonder why gorillas or even Dolphins can't they're also smart</UTT>I am not sure.   But dogs can learn over a thousand words and are better at reasoning than chimps.  That surprises me</UTT>Have you ever put a dog inside your car before? I like how they let their ears flop around in the Wind</UTT>Yes!  It is fun!  I followed a horse truck down the road last week where they were doing the same thing.  Dogs are so smart - they love solving problems and earning rewards..</UTT>Well I was driving my car with my dog and we actually stopped at a drive-thru, I never knew that drive-thrus were started in 1975</UTT>Right - McDonalds did it to help the soldiers.  That was nice of them.</UTT>Yes I agree. The soldiers could not get out of their car if they were wearing fatigues so McDonald's created the drive-up window, Burger King should let us put flamethrowers on our cars so we can get that flame grilled taste on the go lol</UTT>laugh!  I know - I wonder if google's cars which have an "aggressive" mode come with flamethrowers?</UTT>Haha well that would make me scared to drive a car LOL. What about the trunk of a car? Do you know where the name for that came from</UTT>Didn't the old cars from the early 1900's actually have wooden trunks on them?  They probably should avoid the flamethrowers</UTT>Haha that's a good point. I used to play this video game called Gran Turismo back in the day, apparently someone got so good that they became a real race car driver after playing it
t_959a441b-b195-4e4c-b55d-cde9fdefa13d</CONV>Hey there, do you have much interest in nature?</UTT>About the same as the average person.  I don't mind a short hike in the woods, or sitting by a river trying to catch some fish.</UTT>Nice, sounds fun. Did you know that there are species of fish that can eat prey twice their size?</UTT>I'd like to see what they look like after a meal.  Like I feel after Thanksgiving.</UTT>Hahaha so true. Yeah, they are called the black swallower, how fitting their name.</UTT>Is a jellyfish a fish?  I heard there is one that is immortal!</UTT>Yeah that is the one species of jellyfish that scientists have been studying for so long trying to crack their secret. I guess sometimes it is hard to tell what a fish is, like the seahorse.</UTT>I just don't know how you know something is immortal.</UTT>they must have studied them for so long. same as they do a lot of experimenting with zebra fish.</UTT>Speaking of science and up to date technology, it turns out the White House still uses floppy disks.  to store date.</UTT>Old school but there must be a good reason for it. speaking of the white house, it has twin buildings in ireland and france.</UTT>I wonder why that is and who built them.  I used to live in DC, we always looked forward to see the tree go up around the White House.</UTT>I do not know actually and I wonder also who lives there. Well good you got a chance to see it now. Apparently Roosevlet banned them from the white house</UTT>Yeah, bit of a conservationist.  Just like the Norwegians, they donated a billion dollars to the amazon rain forest once.</UTT>That is a  lot of money. On the other hand the US government has really shifted their focus towards protecting their employees from prosecution if they violate geneva conventions</UTT>I wonder if it's against the Geneva Convention to see national monuments.  A man in France pretended to work for the government and sold the Eiffel Tower, not once but twice!</UTT>That is just insane, wow. Do you know when the White HOuse started getting used as a president's house?</UTT>I understand since John Adams.  Isn't he the second president.</UTT>That house must require a lot of maintenance. I wonder if they still have the solar panel that George Bush put back in it?</UTT>'d like to think of Bush up there installing them himself, with his tool belt on and cursing as things don't go right. You'd think it would be a Democrat putting up solar.</UTT>Hahaha well there you go. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good one

What about Trent Williams? He played with a dislocated thumb.</UTT>I would think it might be harder to play with a shoulder injury than a thumb injury</UTT>Well, yes. Any injury when trying to play would not be fun in my book.</UTT>Do you think Peterson can lead the Redskins into the playoffs with Smith out with a broken leg?</UTT>I don't know. Being without the quaterback they're used to could throw things off for them.</UTT>The Redskins are on the edge right now so I'm not sure Peterson is the answer. The Giants on the other hand are just horrible this year.</UTT>Yeah. What do you think of Eli Manning?</UTT>I think its time for him to retire or turn the ball over to another qb</UTT>haha He'd be okay being he has a "geinus-level" IQ.</UTT>He is far from a genious in my book.</UTT>Yeah, not my words, just what I've heard.</UTT>Eli has made way too many "bad" decisions with the ball this year in my opinion. I have watched several of their games this year.</UTT>Yeah. What do you suppose his dad and brother think of how he's been doing?</UTT>I'm sure they are trying to help as much as they can. I heard Payton has been sitting down with him and going over game film.</UTT>Makes sense. Who do you think was the best of the Manning clan?</UTT>Definitely Payton!</UTT>Hopefully Eli can learn from him then haha</UTT>Happy Holidays!

But it has paid off for them with the ad revenue</UTT>YEah nice! All the videos on youtube are cool</UTT>Except for Justin bieber's "baby" is the most disliked video on youtube. I think it was just beat out though</UTT>Gangam style was so popular they had to change how they counted videos.</UTT>Many celebrities have their own youtube channels</UTT>The police even have their own youtube called blutube.</UTT>Judge judy makes $123,000 per episode, making her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james</UTT>That a lot. Did you Carol Burnett was the first celeb to appear on Sesame Street?</UTT>I did not! Celebrity status is often associated with wealth. And  fame often provides opportunities to earn revenue.</UTT>true. There's an Ethiopian celebrity using his celebrity for good trying to convince his people to diversify their diet.</UTT>Thats a interesting thing to try and get people to do</UTT>Speaking of use their influence Burger King apparently was giving people Whoppers if they unfriended 10 people on facebook!</UTT>thats silly. Iceland are rewriting their constitution via facebook; allowing the public to make suggestions and alterations. What a use for social media</UTT>Better than banning the like button like they did in a part of Germany.</UTT>I dont even get the point of that</UTT>I wonder if they block the like button on Youtube? It's the second largest search engine in the world.</UTT>That would be nuts. On account that Netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic in north america

I really like Linkin Park, and their 'Hybrid Theory' album is the top selling in the 21st century.</UTT>My favorite band is One Direction. I know a few songs of Linkin Park.</UTT>I like them too. I think it's interesting that even though Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was released over 40 years ago, it was actually in the top sellers back in 2014.</UTT>I miss when One Direction were together. That is interesting.</UTT>I hate it when good bands break up. There was a set of Japanese twins that actually made a rap album together at the age of 100! I think that's pretty awesome.</UTT>If only I know the name of the Japanese twin's music, I would be down to listen to it?</UTT>I can't recall, but it's great to listen and watch, so you should check it out. I love comedy, so it fell into that area. Do you like?</UTT>Can you recommend me some comedy?</UTT>Sure! I really enjoy movies like Pineapple Express and the Hangover. Although some people think of them as 'bromantic' comedies, I just think they are funny overall. Do you like that kind?</UTT>I do like that kind</UTT>Have you watched the comedy show 3rd Rock? It received the best comedy Golden Globe in 97. It even beat Friends and Seinfeld, which are really good shows.</UTT>I have not. What is that?</UTT>It's just a funny comedy, but it's pretty old, but still good. You should also check out some movies with the actor Ryan Stiles, he's pretty funny. Do you know him?</UTT>Is it on Netflix? If it is, I'll try to watch it. I do not know him.</UTT>I'm not sure, it's possible. did you know that in Africa, people can legally add a flame-thrower to their car to stop carjackings? I couldn't believe that was legal! It's actually kind of funny...</UTT>Is the flamethrower attached to the car?</UTT>Yes, and completely legal! I guess they handle their protection a bit more serious than us in America. I'm glad we have them now, instead of buggies with horses though.</UTT>That is cool!</UTT>There's a race car driver that actually began that profession because they beat over 90,000 people at the video game gran turismo named Jann Mardenborough. They are very skilled, I'd say lol</UTT>Nice to chat with you.
t_abcc8901-93a4-4959-aa5e-c439770d7c6d</CONV>Hello,  how are you doing?  Do you like football? The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink</UTT>I guess the pink is meant to soften up the opposition. The game of football certainly has a lot of interesting history.</UTT>yeah.  I cant imagine its for intimidation lol In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars</UTT>Football hadn't developed as much of a sport then. I've heard that many of the world's biggest stadiums belong to college football teams. Not surprised. In some towns, there's not much else to do on a Saturday.</UTT>Right.  College football has a lot of funding too.</UTT>That's true at the high school level, too. The stadium in Allen, Texas, cost $60 million. That's for high school!</UTT>Wow,  well Texas does love its football. The highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222-0</UTT>I never expected a tech school to be good at football, but probably Cumberland was just a tiny college. The football coaches get paid insane amounts these days.</UTT>I know right.  Former partiots rb benjarvus green-ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career.</UTT>That is an achievement!</UTT>thats incredible. Did you know Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago</UTT>Perhaps they didn't need it with the discovery of fire and the creation of clothing.</UTT>Yeah probably just adapting to the environment.</UTT>Human beings haven't been around that long, either. If you looked at the earth's history as 24 hours, we've been here for only 1 minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>Wow.  Humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals.</UTT>Doesn't sound like much of an ability, but it has allowed us to spread around the globe. Now we're going out into space!</UTT>yup! This is a bummer Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective</UTT>We depend on other creatures to get the nutrition we need. Did you know that we are the only mammals that can't swallow and breathe at the same time?</UTT>I feel like I only know this from experience.  There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.</UTT>That's probably the same frequency for a lot of animals. Something about the earth moving I bet.</UTT>Great talking to you have a good one.
t_0bb146e3-cc19-4a30-bd72-8aa71d57d5b0</CONV>Hi how are you?</UTT>Great.  Who would think Trump's tariffs on China would help people who trade in knockoff designer bags?</UTT>HA! That's funny... Knockoff handbags... I think the whole idea is just weird. What a weird thing to stump on...</UTT>I know, not a designer kind of guy myself... There's another $200 billion around the corner.  It hurts businesses that have legit designer handbags.</UTT>Im not either. It hurts a lot of the american businesses too.</UTT>Yep.  Beijing has promised to crack down on the counterfeiters but I'm not holding my breath.</UTT>No... it does not benefit them to do so. like reading those pesky terms of service when buying something online.</UTT>Yeah, I never read that.  Only 7% of people do.</UTT>I always just click accept and hope for the best. I am part of the 93%. If you are on mt everest, you can read it with your 3G!</UTT>Good to know.  I'm a 93%-er too. I love the internet but use it mostly for keeping up with people, shopping and entertainment.</UTT>Are you on Facebook? I tried giving it up for this year, only when I need it, and dont really miss it.</UTT>I am but I'm mostly an observer/commenter...</UTT>When I was on there I almost only looked at people's profiles. I have nothing to add and I hated to brag about stuff I do with photos.</UTT>Did you know most countries don't have what we call a President?</UTT>I did not know that. That's different.</UTT>OK. Yeah if you were a "President" you could go to all those summit meeting with big wigs from other countries.  That actually sounds boring.</UTT>No... I would actually wear big wigs and have so much fun. I would do the whole thing with a glass of wine.</UTT>Cool. You sound like the Indonesian President that released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Ha! Are Indonesians that hungry for music?</UTT>Must be.  I don't know what genre that is... They could have a big dance party instead of a boring summit meeting.  They could network it on 3g.</UTT>Nice chatting with you!
t_0d7ec07e-68ac-401d-b2b5-63382304344d</CONV>Hi, how are you?</UTT>Good!  You?   Do you like video games?</UTT>I'm good, thanks for asking.  I like video games, I started out playing on an old Atari 2600 system back in the day, that I still have in my closet!</UTT>That is so cool!  I have the NES sitting under my tv.  I loved the old school games!</UTT>Cool beans!  I hear that in South Korea it's illegal for kids under 16 to play video games after midnight.  Wow!</UTT>Taking things a bit extreme there.  I agree it isnt good for them to be up playing, but making it illegal...</UTT>Well, I would have probably been under the jail, because I know I played alot after midnight, when I was supposed to be sleeping!  lol</UTT>I liked sleep too much even then.  But I did spend many summers saving the princess.</UTT>Hey, I had the Pacman pattern memorized.  Do you watch NFL football?</UTT>Me too!  That game never ended though...  It just kept going.  I watch a little football.  You?</UTT>Yeah, but lately it's gotten boring.  That Super Bowl dragged on for what seemed like three hours.</UTT>Especially considering how little live action there is in a given game.</UTT>I read somewhere there is only 11 minutes of actual live gameplay.  I knew there was alot of wasted time spent standing around, but come on.</UTT>I know.  It would be an interesting game on a running clock.  15 seconds max in between plays.  Like extreme football.</UTT>Or have a female player, that might make it more interesting to watch?</UTT>It would.  She would probably keep their egos in check too.</UTT>You're probably right! Well, I read there's no NFL rule against females.  I wonder why there is not at least a kicker, yet?</UTT>With how they are to the saints cheerleaders, I guess there is no rush.</UTT>That's pretty rough, from what I understand.  Can't eat at no restaurant where a NFL payer is at and if they are eating and one walks in they have to leave.  Wow, wonder what happened to prompt that rule?</UTT>I cant imagine it would be anything that you couldnt solve by talking to grown adults about it.</UTT>Well, I bet it's something juicy, for sure!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this evening.  Have a good night, friend!
t_9e4f3c25-1918-4add-9fb6-bf517bc33881</CONV>Hello.  Probably this fact is before Trump, but the three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington and Jefferson</UTT>Hey, it takes a lot of money to get elected!  Campaigns are expensive.  Did you know up until 1905, the runner up would become Vice President?  I can imagine all the fighting that would have caused!</UTT>I heard about it.  Imagine if Hillary was Trump's VP.</UTT>I know, that would be crazy!  Did you know the President of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?  Can you imagine any of our current or former Presidents singing?? LOL</UTT>I also heard about it.  I hoped he did not ignore his main obligation - running the country.</UTT>Maybe he combined them.. turning political speeches into pop songs. Hehe!</UTT>About another foreign president:  The first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana.</UTT>Wonder if that was his name or a title.  You know, like "Head Banana"  LOL.  Hey, speaking of music.. you go to many concerts?</UTT>In the past.  I have not had time lately.  I heard that LInkin Park played 342 concerts in 2001.</UTT>Yeah, wish I could have seen that!  Sadly, I don't think they're going to tour anymore with Bennington's death.  :(</UTT>I know.  It was sad.  Their debut album was so successful</UTT>Now you want to talk long concert runs, they say The Ramones have played 2,263 concerts for almost 20 years!  Now that's dedication!</UTT>That was a dedication, indeed.  An ancient roman amphitheatre in Croatia (former Yugoslavia) is still used for concerts.</UTT>Wow, I bet that would be awesome to attend a concert in a place like!  I think Pink Floyd once recorded a concert in an old amphitheater...</UTT>I heard about it.  Apparently, they had a live concert in the ancient place without any audience.</UTT>Huh... no audience?  Did they at least record it, I wonder?  Otherwise, seems like that would be a little pointless..</UTT>They might just make a music video or, perhaps it was to personally enjoy the ambience.</UTT>Speaking of concerts, they say a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band.  Can you imagine a concert THAT bad you get sued for it?  Wow...</UTT>I never heard that before.  How bad could it be?  I do not like people suing for every small thing.</UTT>Dunno, maybe if they had technical problems and the audience couldn't hear it very well.  Or one of the band members showed up drunk, I could definitely see suing for that reason...</UTT>You do not have to sue.  Just complain on social media - it would be enough.  I have never been a fan of Creed.  Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you.
t_255f67f4-9c61-4296-8981-476f2528f92a</CONV>Hi! Do you watch the Bachelor? I could watch it all day... it's so great how they always have a villian and drama</UTT>I never have, no. I can see how that's entertaining, but it kinda kills the idea that it's supposed to be "reality."</UTT>You just have to go in knowing that. I mean the fact that a 22 year old is trying to get a 36 year old is kind of crazy!</UTT>Yeah, I admit I was being a little assumptive. Is that even called reality TV anymore? I don't think anybody actually thinks of it that way. It's just manipulated drama.</UTT>I agree completely but I watch it for the drama honestly! For example, there is one girl who assumes everyone is jealous but really Arie doesnt like her.</UTT>Yeah, and it seems like they are very careful who they let on the show. Like, they want personalities that will clash, so that things like Krystal trashing the other girls will naturally happen.</UTT>They also plan dates that will bring out the drama. LIke they make the "wilderness" date which will bring out all the girls' discomfort.</UTT>I can see why. I wouldn't want to have to eat worms or drink urine, either.</UTT>ALso, the fact that Arie still gave Krystal a rose even though she's obviously attention seeking is clearly planned. I think they tell him who to pick, don't you?</UTT>That would not surprise me at all. I wouldn't be surprised to know that things like Krystal calling the others out for being insecure are coached, as well. They know how to get people to watch.</UTT>Very true. I think that they also try to get people engaged on social media. They always have people tweeting like @jordynhtaylor's tweet</UTT>Oh yeah, definitely. The fact that @kellykeegs is listed after her name in articles is even more evidence of that.</UTT>I will say Tia and Kendall being into the wild stuff in the wilderness was also very survivor-esque. It makes for good tv!!</UTT>Yeah, they may as well make the most of it. If you're gonna have to eat worms, why not at least try and enjoy it?</UTT>Yuck. I Will I admit that I do enjoy drama. I was pretty sad that Jim carrey won't do drama anymore. I love him!</UTT>I hadn't heard that! It is a shame. He's really good at it.</UTT>very different than the reality tv drama haha</UTT>Oh yeah, for sure. I just now learned that soap operas were called that because the shows were sponsored by soap manufacturers. That's funny.</UTT>That's soo interesting! I actually was interested to learn that drama came from so long ago-- ancient Greece!</UTT>It does have a pretty interesting past. Entertainment goes back a long way, really.</UTT>I also really enjoy drama in the theater. Doyou?</UTT>I do, yeah. I haven't been in a while, though.</UTT>Also did you know that there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of radio drama for FREE!!</UTT>I did not! I have listened to quite a few podcasts, which can be similar, I guess.</UTT>Absolutely , what genre of podcasts?</UTT>Usually comedy. Interviews, or just general talking shows with comedians.</UTT>I like them all as welL!!
t_b6d74e94-3d3d-4c63-ac8f-7366e430b190</CONV>Hello,  did you know the sun is actually white?</UTT>Hi! I wasn't aware of that but I do know that sunset on Mars is a blue color. I think that would be very interesting to see and beautiful!</UTT>Yeah that is interesting!</UTT>I also think it's interesting that the sun doesn't rotate as a solid body... and the equator actually rotates faster than the poles!</UTT>Same.  its also pretty crazy that a lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the surface of the sun.</UTT>Is it really? I certainly don't want to be struck then. Ha! You know the sun makes up 99.86% of our solar system's mass? That's amazing!</UTT>That is amazing!  cant believe its that big!</UTT>I know, right? And on a related note, helium was the only element discovered on the sun before we discovered it on earth, believe it or not!</UTT>wow.  also, neptune completed its first orbit of the sun in 2011 since it was discovered in 1846.</UTT>That is amazing. I can't believe it took that long! There's actually a radio station that can translate solar activity into sound so you can listen to the sun's live music! I'm hoping to hear it someday!</UTT>Thats impressive,  I wonder if they actually release the station its on.</UTT>That is a good question. I love listening to the radio as it is, particularly politics. Speaking of politics, did you know Woodrow Wilson was the only president to have a PhD? Isn't that hard to believe?</UTT>That is hard to believe,  you would think more would have it.  I think he has a phd in political science.</UTT>I think so as well. But just as surprising, we haven't had a president speak a foreign language fluently since FDR. I always assumed all presidents could speak different languages.</UTT>I havent known any of our recent ones speak any.  yeah i think he spoke french and german!  Not positive though.</UTT>Maybe so! Can you also believe that Lincoln was the first president to be photographed at his inauguration and ironically, John Wilkes Booth was also in the photo? Weird, huh?</UTT>Damn,  Lincoln got photo bombed!  and by his assassinator,  creepy.</UTT>That is creepy, isn't it? So how would you feel if we implemented a law like Guatemala that didn't allow close relatives of former presidents to ever run as president?</UTT>It doesn't effect me at all.  I dont think I would vote for it though,  it makes sense that family members are immersed in the world of politics and can be a great candidate for the same position or in that vicinity.</UTT>Agreed. I honestly feel the exact same way! I often wonder if presidents have weird rituals like Darrell Green who would stuff tootsie rolls in his socks before games saying it made him run faster.</UTT>Oh wow,  why would that make him run faster lol Its been great chatting,  gotta run.
t_26348b59-8824-43f0-9a51-9319361fa5c3</CONV>hi! do you like football?</UTT>Yea, I watch it all the time. I heard DJ Moore might get drafted by the Carolina Panthers</UTT>That is exciting to leave Maryland for him!</UTT>I hear Norv Turner is pretty impressed with Moore, he would probably be a good fit</UTT>I can't believe he had 30 other scouts looking at him!</UTT>Yea, Mel Kiper thinks Moore will go to Jacksonville at number 29</UTT>I think it is crazy that the average nfl game only has 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>Yea I can see how theres only 11 minutes of gameplay in the nfl with how much time players take to get ready between plays</UTT>I also did not know that the nfl has no written rule against female players.</UTT>It will be interesting to see if there is every a female player as a place kicker since they can play by rule</UTT>That would be interesting. Did you know engineers have a higher average life long earning?</UTT>Yea, I can see how an engineer makes more lifetime than a nfl player since they have longer careers and less injuries</UTT>Yes, I wonder the average years an NFL player stays in the league.</UTT>Not as long as head coaches, Bill Belichick has been coaching so long he was the last head coach of the Browns to win a playoff game</UTT>That is a long time! I wonder his net worth.</UTT>I don't know but Belichick must have a lot of money after winning 21 postseason games as a coach</UTT>It is funny that the buffalo bills are equal to the patriots in super bowl losses</UTT>I find it funny Tom Brady's jv football team never started him despite not winning a game</UTT>I wonder how he improved so much.</UTT>I don't know but he is pretty smart, probably not as smart as Alex Smith who received his bachelor's degree in 2 years</UTT>Wow that is impressive. I wonder if he did it so fast so that he could go pro.</UTT>Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
t_f719eb3f-ef30-4de4-b82b-13282cd8390d</CONV>Are you a football fan, I just moved to the Boston area four years ago so I got kind of sucked into that. Funny, the author of the Game of Thrones compares the Patriots to the Lannisters.</UTT>Lol, I am a Vikings fan. Patriots are a great team but I can see the resemblance lol!</UTT>I agree, my wife loves that show. Me, I'm average on it. I actually lived for 49 years in KC and had season tickets at Arrowhead so the Chiefs are my team. Ironic that Bill Bellichick won a playoff game as the Cleveland Browns head coach in 1995, and the Browns haven't won a playoff game since.</UTT>Wow, he is just a playoff winning coach. I think he is the most winningest coach in playoff history</UTT>I think you're correct, he is worshiped around here. I was a Fran Trakington (sp?) fan, but that will date me. You see where Gisele Bundchen doubles her husbands salary with her modeling earning, no ramen noodles in the Brady household.</UTT>lol that may date you, but you have all this experience and knowledge! I wouldn't work if my wife made that much lol</UTT>I agree, You see where Brady has that crazy diet that supposedly keeps him young and in shape, he's never eaten a strawberry in his life. Given his performance past 40 there might be something in that.</UTT>I wonder if he is allergic or something because strawberries are awesome! I heard he was a vegan</UTT>Yes, well he's doing something right, though ironically Belichick puts him on the injury report every week. Why do you think he does that?</UTT>I think that is so interesting, I never knew that. I bet it is to psych teams out to have to work on playing against Brady and the backup potentially, what do you think?</UTT>I agree, or so they'll never know if he's really injured. Did you read where the average NFL game only actually has 11 minutes of live gameplay.  Given the violence and strenuousness of the game that may be a good thing for players bodies and better for commercials during the breaks.</UTT>For sure, I would have guessed a lot higher since games last like 3 hours, but for the safety of the players that is a good enough number</UTT>Did you know that the average Engineer makes more in his life time than the average NFL or MLB player, I guess all those whose career is shortened by injuries bring down the average from the big money players. I hope they have a good pension.</UTT>yea only a select few get that big paycheck. I bet these are the same engineers that make tracking chips that are in shoulder pads that track things</UTT>Yes, I read that. I can see why they track the bowl, but why do you think they track the players' equipment? Also, there's no rule against women playing in the league, I've seem some great women soccer players, you think there will ever be a female kicker?</UTT>I think there is a female kicker in the making. I just read an article the other day and it may happen sooner than later, that would be great i feel!</UTT>On the flip side of that, did you see where the New Orleans Saints don't allow their cheerleaders to dine at the same restaurant as the players? If they eating when a player enters they have to leave the restaurant immediately? That seem sexist and has the making of a law suit to me.</UTT>That is such sexism, I wonder what the other teams think of that or even if they know it is happening. Someone should speak up!</UTT>In this day and age I'm surprised someone hasn't or a crafty lawyer addressed that. My inlaws are from upstate New York, you see the Bills are equal to the Patriots in Super Bowl losses (kind of Ying and Yang in my wife's family), they suffer up there. I know a bunch of my wife's cousins who love Jim Kelly from the 4 Super Bowl loss run.</UTT>That was sad, they got 2nd place like so many years in a row I think. Kind of embarrassing, but also pretty cool they made it that far all the time. It was so nice chatting with you, go Brady!</UTT>Then again, my Chiefs last won when  Richard Nixon was President so we know disappointment too, but Patrick Mahomes has breathed hope back in the franchise. We actually went to our first game at Gillette out in Foxborough this year when the Chiefs-Patriots played and that was an amazing game in a loss.</UTT>yikes that is a long time. I think your chiefs will win it in the next 3 years. I am calling it! Have a great weekend!
t_9e41c40e-14d8-4ce0-9f90-d314c756d185</CONV>hi did you know the president guest house is bigger than the white house?</UTT>No that's really wild. I wonder why that is? Did you know that the president of Zimbabwe is named President banana haha</UTT>Yeah thats a very unique name!</UTT>I saw that the president of Indonesia has released three pop albums. Do you think president banana has also done this?</UTT>Thats pretty awesome,  he must have a lot of time.  I wonder how many concerts he does.  I have no clue if President Banana has done this lol</UTT>LOL yeah I've never heard of him before either. Do you think we should go back to the old world where the runner-up of the presidential election would become the vice president?</UTT>maybe,  but not until Trump is out lol I dont think him and Hillary would make a good team</UTT>Nope at all. That is a recipe for massive drama. Do you listen to the radio by the way? Sometimes I listen to it on my way to work</UTT>Yes sometimes.  I usually listen to audio book or pandora though.</UTT>Yes I usually listen to YouTube myself. But I did hear that you can listen to a radio Storm from Jupiter. I think it's on the am Radio. I need to try that</UTT>That sounds really interesting!  There is a website you can listen to old classic radio dramas for free!</UTT>Wow Have you listened to it? Probably would like it myself. But say that you get what you pay for haha</UTT>I probably wouldnt listen to it to be honest.  I hear soldiers use to make radios out of a razor blade and a pencil.  thats so weird.</UTT>That is crazy. It was called The Foxhole radio. And I have no idea how it worked haha. I also wouldn't listen to a radio station that was broadcast in classical Latin haha</UTT>me either,  I dont speak latin,  but that is interesting.</UTT>What do you think about the government? I guess they try to destroy Wikileaks or something</UTT>Thats interesting.  I hear that the government owns 86% of Nevada.</UTT>Yep that's what I heard too. I also heard a guy tried to sell the Eiffel Tower twice. That is insane haha</UTT>That guy must be an amzing con artist lol</UTT>Oh totally. Speaking of something that is not a con, Norway gave over 1 billion dollars to help save the Amazon rainforest. That is super nice of them</UTT>That is really nice of them.  I really would like to visit norway one day!</UTT>I would too. The whole country seems like it's full of super nice people haha. Maybe I will see you there

Did you know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer?</UTT>I didnt know that, was he? the martial artists? same guy?</UTT>He was a martial artists. Very famous guy.</UTT>I see, did he ever won a dancing contest as well?</UTT>I saw he did back in 1958. Did you know professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes a week.</UTT>Thats a lot of shoes, they must spend a fortune only in them, you know that parrots can also dance! how cool is that</UTT>I agree. I didn't know that about parrots. That's pretty hilarious.</UTT>Yeah they are able to dance perfectly with music, fun fact they can mimic the music and also speak it</UTT>Very cool. Michael Jackson has a patent on one of his dance moves since it uses an object to let him lean very far to the side.</UTT>MJ was a great dancer, funny fact about him but he wasnt the one that created the moonwalk</UTT>I did not know that about the moonwalk. Do you know who created it?</UTT>It was perfomed by Bill Bailey first back in 1955, this fact came as a suprise to me as well</UTT>Very surprised. Did you know babies instinctively dance when they hear music?</UTT>I didnt hear about that, well if parrots do I guess its not suprising babies do too,,</UTT>Yes. Do you like the radio?</UTT>I do, I listen to it every day, do you like it?</UTT>I love the radio and also listen to it everyday.</UTT>Amazing how a radiostation translates solar activity into sound! how is that even possible</UTT>I agree. It was really good chatting with you.

Mayonnaise ice cream sounds horrible.</UTT>It does sound horrible, both are extremely unhealthy and combining them creates a time bomb, disgusting</UTT>lol, yes! Do you watch U Tube?</UTT>I love Youtube, I use it everyday do you like it?</UTT>Yes I do. I watch it a lot. Its got everything. First video uploaded was a guy talking about an elephant.</UTT>That must be one of the most famous elephants now lol, its amazing how with YouTube they make up half of the peak of the internet traffic in the country</UTT>I believe that, as it began as a dating website.</UTT>It did? I didnt know that, and do you remember Gangnam Style?</UTT>No? What is that? Did you watch any of those 70 full episodes of the Joy of Painting?</UTT>Its a video that got record views on YouTube, really funny you should look it up, YouTube had to update the count integer because of that video</UTT>I will, Do you like dance? Parrots dance perfectly in time with music.</UTT>I dont like dancing I have two left feet, Tupac is a skilled dancer though</UTT>Yes he was, Bill bailey was the first person to do the moonwalk!</UTT>I though the first person to moonwalk was MJ, when did Bill Bailey do that?</UTT>1955, Cannot picture Mr. Rogers doing the breakdance! lol</UTT>Thats a hard scene to picture lol, babies can spontaneously dance when they hear music, the smile more with the beat</UTT>Awww yes, I love that! Now that funky chicken and robot dance is going back.</UTT>Hope there back to stay! ballet dancers sure spend a lot of money on shoes</UTT>Yes, lol.

t_76512697-87f2-4737-b213-3b75a55f616d</CONV>hi how are you? do you like to dance?</UTT>I like to watch it. I know Bruce Lee was a great dancer and he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship in 1958.</UTT>i cant say that im surprised. he must have had a great sense of rhythm. i bet he was a real ladies' man.</UTT>Yeah, I bet. Did you know ballet dancers can go through four pairs of pointe shoes in a week.</UTT>if i were a dancer, i would go through a dozen. LOL. i cannot dance. really.</UTT>Me too! Did you know Michael Jackson has a patent?</UTT>is that the patent on the shoes for that special lean? he really was a genius.</UTT>It was a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.</UTT>yeah, thats it! i was never any good at dancing. i wonder if you have to start when youre young.</UTT>Well, I know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. Maybe the better dancers heard a lot of music when they were younger.</UTT>i wonder if i heard enough music. maybe that was it. maybe i missed by window. oh well.</UTT>Yeah, maybe. I know they smile more when they hit the bet.</UTT>I use smile when i hit a bet too. LOL i heard that tupac was a dancer back in high school.</UTT>Yeah, I think he danced in the Nutcracker in HS.</UTT>I bet he was really good too. he was a backup dancer for digital underground later on. by the way, are you a fan of snakes?</UTT>No. I'm not crazy about snakes. There's no snakes in New Zealand.</UTT>so ive heard. i guess i would move there if i had a phobia of snakes. i have never seen a flying snake. that would be frightening.</UTT>No, basically they;re legless lizards without limbs.</UTT>oh, ok. The fear of snakes is hard-wired  in human brains. i guess that makes sense. we needed it for evolution.</UTT>Yeah, can you believe that crocodiles are more closely related to birds than to snakes.</UTT>i guess scales and feathers are analogous? i never know they were related. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Yeah, good talking with you too!
t_ca30683c-44e4-4f16-9765-ef12eb94c3a9</CONV>Do you listen to the Radio?</UTT>Yes, mostly on my commute to and from work every day.</UTT>Interesting, I have to ride the subway so I can't listen to it. I miss it though. Did you know you can make a radio out of a razor and pencil?</UTT>Oh, that's neat.  I heard that a Hanson song became the most requested track on a Chicago alternative rock radio station because the DJs did not reveal the name of the band.  Those are some talented brothers, they kind of got roped into being a teeny bopper band and never really shook that image.</UTT>Did you know that Hanson is from canada? I didn't.</UTT>Oh, cool.  Celine Dion, Shania Twain, and Hanson, all the Canada artists, I can think of. All good, though.  Did you know that the most popular radio act of the 1930s was a ventriloquist?  I don't even know how that was possible over the radio?</UTT>Interesting, I didn't know that. I wonder why people liked that.</UTT>Who knows, times were simpler back then.  Maybe people were more easily amosed. Lol</UTT>yeah. Did you know there is a website where you can listen to thousand of episodes of classic radio?</UTT>No, I didn't know that.  I'll have to check it out.  I do know that there is a radio station that translates the solar activity into sound so you can listen to the sun's music, live.  How cool is that?</UTT>It's pretty cool. Do you know if it is AM or FM radio?</UTT>It's an Am station out of Topeka, Kansas.  On a different note have you ever visited 1600 Pennsylvania avenue in Washington, D.C. ?</UTT>I have, I actually live in that area. Pretty cool stuff.</UTT>That's nice.  Did you know the very first phone number for the White House was"1"?</UTT>No, I didn't. That is crazy, I wonder how many prank calls they got!</UTT>Probably a plenty.  I hear there is a replica of the White House in Atlanta, which was built as a private home. Have you ever visited it?</UTT>No, but I've visited the real one. It is not nearly as big as you would think.</UTT>That's what I heard.  Most of it is below ground, I hear.  Do you know that Jimmy Carter installed solar panels, which Ronald Reagan promptly had removed, when he took office?</UTT>Interesting, and then George W put them back in.</UTT>To each his own I guess. Jimmy Carter also had all the thermostats turned down to 65 degrees the Winter of 1977.  Which, I was a little girl back then, but it was very cold.</UTT>Interesting, well nice chatting with you!

Kim jong un has started to edit pictures to depict a different history just as previous communist leaders mao and stalin did.</UTT>He does have a degree in Physics and Military Studies</UTT>That's interesting. I read that no one knows how old he is. Bizarre!</UTT>I think him ordering the killing of his own family members is as cold as you can get.</UTT>Yes! And Trump decided to meet with him, the first meeting between a US President and North Korean leader.</UTT>I don't think Kim has any respect for him whatsoever. He had his half brother killed and uncle too so I doubt he has any admiration for Trump</UTT>I am sure there were many ulterior motives. I didn't realize he is the first North Korean leader to have been born after the country's founding</UTT>Yep and he is the first one to allow his country's participation in the olympics too but under a agreement with the South</UTT>Interesting! He and Trump meeting was to discuss the North Korean nuclear program.</UTT>I don't think he's going to give up his nuclear program. I think he'll use it as leverage for negotiations to get what he wants</UTT>I didn't realize he is called "The Marshall"</UTT>They are all made up names.</UTT>The satire group The Onion voted him Sexiest Man Alive. Haha</UTT>I think they were trolling him</UTT>There have been many famous meetings of international heads of state, which were have been called summits since 1955.</UTT>Trump is scheduled to have another Summit with Kim early next year</UTT>Oh boy! Spain is the only country that has been a permanent guest at every g20 summit.</UTT>Maybe they should think of uninviting Kim, Trump and Putin...lol</UTT>That would be interesting! During the brisbane g20 summit, when putin shook the canadian prime minister's hand, the latter said "i guess i'll shake your hand, but i have only one thing to say to you. you need to get out of ukraine."</UTT>It was uncomfortable to watch Putin give MBS that handshake at the last Summit</UTT>I didn't watch, thankfully! Nice chatting with you. Take care!

It is the biggest money maker of football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis, and hockey.</UTT>Yes, the world loves soccer. everyone can play it. men, women, big small, rich, poor. it is the most democratic sport.</UTT>Jon Stewart played soccer in college. He doesn't strike me as an athlete.</UTT>Now, no, he doesnt. but he is pretty thin. he has the build of a former soccer player. i used to play, but i dont look it now LOL</UTT>Have you ever played three team soccer? It sounds challenging.</UTT>What is that even? how does that work? why does it exist? how many referees are there? I have questions.</UTT>I have questions too! It seems odd. I assume it would still be on a rectangular field with goalies.</UTT>Yes, i guess. how many goals? one for each team? why is this game needed, and who plays it? and is there a video game version of it out there?</UTT>I assume there is written material on it. Reading is a great option for decoding symbols to gain meaning.</UTT>I try to read as much as possible. i enjoy reading. i find it an enjoyable way to pass the time. You?</UTT>I enjoy reading so much I have to speed read to get it all done. The world record is 4,700 words per minute. I'm not nearly that fast!</UTT>does it help much? i figure that i wouldnt retain much of what i read at that speed. i guess it is a good way to get familiar with material.</UTT>It's tough to have good comprehension. I'm not a fan of poetry. Seems like neither is CS tolkien since he held a "you laugh you lose" poetry competition with tolkien.</UTT>Tolkien and Lewis were great authors and had an appreciation of language. i would buy tickets to see that contest.</UTT>A moral panic spread in the 18th century because so many people read novels.</UTT>Novels were seen as the words of the devil! Poetry was seen as the source of higher thought and sublime morality!</UTT>I would like to learn how to read braille. What an amazing option for those that can't see.</UTT>Yes, the guy that invented it was quite young when he came up with it. I wonder how it works for Chinese readers.

Did you know one third of all divorce fillings in 2011 in the u.s. had the word facebook?</UTT>what does it mean "had the word facebook?" Facebook somehow is responsible ?</UTT>I am not really sure.  I know facebook has changed a lot about the world.</UTT>oh yes, it expanded... now we got marketplace in Facebook so it's a competition to ebay and craigslist and I heard there is going to be a dating addition soon ;)</UTT>That is interesting.  I wonder what the dating addition will be like.</UTT>You know - same like all others but integrated in Facebook profile so people see Your history and basically already know a lot about You - it would help to make a better dating choice ;)</UTT>Yeah that is true.

Robert Downy Jr was an awesome choice to play Iron Man!</UTT>I read somewhere that Iron Man's suit is roughly about 450 pieces !  Crazy right!</UTT>That is insane. i wonder how many pieces to put on?</UTT>I have no clue!  lol Did you know JARVIS stands for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System?</UTT>i dont think i did. that makes sense though givien the technology in the movie and the exoskeleton suit</UTT>The actor who plays JARVIS,  Paul Bettany,  has never even seen Iron Man!  They paid him so much money to do it and he doesnt even care to see the movie lol</UTT>wow. thats interseting</UTT>The director chose to film in California because most of the super heroes takes place on the east coast!</UTT>Hmm...why is that? lol The director was Jon Favreau, right?</UTT>Right. I read that he did that because most of the super heroes take place in the east coast.</UTT>Was that the directors choice though? Or was it one of the writers? Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway were the writing teams I believe.</UTT>I read it was Jon Favreau's choice.  this film was in development for a long time,  like 13 years or something.</UTT>Holy Cow lol that is insane! And if i remember right, it came out in 2008. I don't remember what years the other ones came out. I wonder how long those were in development?</UTT>Yeah,  I think Iron Man was this first to release of the Marvel movies,  so they released after Iron Man.  I read somewhere Tom Cruise and Nicholas Cage were also considered to be Iron Man.</UTT>Yuck lol. That move would have been horrible I think. I just cant picture that lol.</UTT>Right!  lol Wouldve been totally different.</UTT>I wouldn't have even seen it lol. That would have gone on to ruin the avengers movies lol .</UTT>They probably wouldnt have made spin offs if Iron Man tanked in the box office! haha,  been good chatting.

I know a lot of young kids are very into the game.</UTT>It seems to have a lot of options like exploration, resource gathering, crafting and compat.</UTT>They get to build a lot of things and have their own world.  Very creative.</UTT>It is 3D also.  I wonder if there is music.</UTT>I am not sure. Ive never played myself.</UTT>I heard something about a music festival called Coachella that actually had 2600 people attend.</UTT>I have heard of the festival, but Ive never been.</UTT>I don't know if it is a physical place or a place within the Minecraft game.  I guess I would have to do some reading to find out.  Do you enjoy reading?</UTT>I do.  It is my favorite way to pass the time.  Im really into non-fiction.</UTT>They say that only the best readers in the middle ages were capable of reading silently.</UTT>That is really neat, I never thought about that.</UTT>So, we would be really good readers if we lived 500 years ago.</UTT>True,   Have you read Enders Game?</UTT>No.  What can you tell me about it?</UTT>It is on a military reading list.  It is about a boy fighting an alien race in what he thinks is a game, but turns out to be a real war.</UTT>That is an interesting set-up.  Did you know that Louis Braille invented his system of reading and writing for the blind when he was only 15?</UTT>Wow.  That is awesome!  Well Ive got to go, Nice chat!

Dogs can have 12 different blood types.</UTT>Wow, that's a lot of different blood types. Did you know that Google prefers dogs over cats? I guess it's in their code of conduct.</UTT>That's a company that I could work for! AOL was probably a cat company.</UTT>Ha, that's funny! Did you know the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana?</UTT>That is a weird nickname. I wonder if he got that in college...</UTT>Maybe so!  Did you know that panda researchers wear panda costumes to work?</UTT>That's weird. Istanbul has a vending machine for dogs! That's so kind.</UTT>What, that's crazy! Wonder how long they stay in there if no one buys them. Did you know the U.S. President's guest house is bigger than the White House?</UTT>That's gotta infuriate Trump. He doesn't seem like the type to tolerate that...</UTT>No kidding. The president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office. Now that's something Trump hasn't done.</UTT>Up until 1805, the losing presidental candidate would become vice president. Can you imagine Hilary and trump working together?</UTT>I tend to think that would be a good thing. It would force them to work together and might not make the campaigns so cut throat.</UTT>It proabably would bring back some civility on the campaign trails. I am not looking forward to 2020. It's going to be a train wreck...</UTT>No kidding. There's a lack of viable candidates unfortunately. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing?</UTT>I did not. I can understand dogs knowing it but elephants? That's amazing!</UTT>And all this time I thought the elephants at the zoo were completely trained! Do you know what Pizzagate was?</UTT>I do! A far-fetched conspiracy theory!

Did you know Netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth?</UTT>no that is wild, I see why they want to switch to all digital, also crazy that netflix and youtube together make up half of all internet traffic, I watch youtube all the time</UTT>That is also crazy. I didn't realize Reed Hastings was inspired to startup Netflix after racking up $40 in late fees on Apollo 13.</UTT>haha ya that is a wild thing, good movie though, sad that blockbuster didn't buy them when they had the chance</UTT>I agree. Crazy that Netflix is now worth $2 billion.</UTT>yup, they were offered to blockbuster for 50 million, thats quite a lot of value appreciation!</UTT>That is a very big jump in appreciation. Did you know that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee lol?</UTT>oh I did, they also do fantasy congress, people seem to do fantasy everything these days haha</UTT>lol that's hilarious.

I know some stuff like how the president since 1853 has either been a republican or a democrat</UTT>Yeah, the Republican Party took the place of the Whig Party after it collapsed.</UTT>Yeah. Did you know that Reagan actually campaigned for democrats and railed againts high corporate profits?</UTT>I'd definitely like some background context for that, LOL.</UTT>I guess he was really against that and also for low wages too</UTT>That would be my guess, but I'm curious to nail down exactly when he complained about corporate profits.</UTT>Oh I am afraid I do not have all the details there. Do you know when the use red and blue colors started by both parties?</UTT>I remember all the drama over the election map in 2000 and how "Blue States" and "Red States" caught on, and journalists stuck with that assignment from then on. I think they used red and blue before that, but switched the assignment every four years.</UTT>Yeah always fun when the elections come around. On another topic, do you listen to the radio at all?</UTT>Not much, because the radio stopped working in my truck and I live in a place that's a radio dead zone except for one Top 40 station. I listen to a lot of music on YouTube. How about you?</UTT>Oh that is nice then. Yes I listen to the radio. Apparently you can catch Jupiter's storms in AM radio</UTT>I wonder what they sound like? I should see if there's a recording online.</UTT>Maybe there is. DO you know how soldiers made foxhole radios during WWII?</UTT>Not until just now. That sounds very creative -- like a MacGuyver trick.</UTT>Yeah it was creative, they used razorblades and pencils to make them</UTT>Did you ever try to make a crystal radio? I got a kit for Christmas once when I was a kid but couldn't put it together so it would work.</UTT>I have not but it sounds like fun. DO you ever listen to radio dramas?</UTT>My brother-in-law is a radio nostalgia fan and I've listened to some old recordings from his collection. What I really like are the comedies, like Lum &Abner. Ever heard of them?</UTT>I have not but maybe it is time I check them out. So nice chatting with you.

I like the Skimm a lot, especially because it gives links to the longer articles on topics I'm interested in. Fox News is very supportive of conservative activism now.</UTT>I hear that IGN and fox news are owned by the same company.  That's cool.</UTT>Yeah IGN is a gaming website, right? That's interesting. And whatever Fox is doing, I guess it's working, because Fox News is watched more often than MSNBC and CNN combined!</UTT>Wow that is impressive.  Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons before.</UTT>That's so interesting, especially considering that the Simpsons is aired on Fox!</UTT>I know right,  and probably make them a lot of money!  Guess they didn't like them making fun of them.</UTT>If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen I guess! Did you know they actually discussed the possibility of creating a channel exclusively airing the Simpsons?</UTT>Oh wow,  that would be amazing,  but now that we have streaming it might not be profitable.  Maybe they should just allow streaming on their website.</UTT>Yeah agreed. I hate it when they only show a few recent episodes on major channels and you can't stream all the episodes. I wonder how often they make fun of the president on the Simpsons?</UTT>Haha there has to be someone out there who is counting.</UTT>Yeah definitely. There are so many random fun facts about the position of president. Did you know that everyone called the first president of Zimbabwe "President Banana"?!</UTT>It's not like they were making fun of him though, that was his last name.</UTT>I had no idea. Still, pretty interesting! Did you know that the vice president used to always be the runner-up of the presidential election until 1805?</UTT>yeah that would probably not fly now lol they would not be a good team.  I cant imagine them agreeing on anything.</UTT>Yeah, Clinton and Trump would be an atrocious combination. I wonder how that used to work out! I find it interesting that Trump is not one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents in US history.</UTT>Oh he's number 1 for sure,  he is far wealthier than any of our presidents.</UTT>I don't know if he is, I'm pretty sure it's JFK, Washington, and Jefferson! But who knows, I guess</UTT>Yeah he is!  I have looked it up a few times before.  I believe according to Google it was trump,  then Washington and then Jefferson.  I cant imagine it has changed in a few months lol</UTT>Yeah I'm sure not! Must be a mistake on my information source's part!</UTT>Maybe.  Anyways,  its been great talking to you!

It is crazy how it started as a book store and has developed to what it is today.  Jeff Bezos certainly has a great vision.</UTT>That's true.  I do wonder though why he built a clock into a mountain.  The clock should run for the next 10,000 years.</UTT>I think having something run that long would be a neat accomplishment, something that you create to exist long past your time.</UTT>I never thought about it like that.  You are right.  His employees are taken care of apparently too.  The warehouse workers get a good exercise every day. They work between 7 and 15 miles during their shift.</UTT>That is a crazy amount, those warehouses must be pretty big, a lot bigger than when the first items were sold for sure.  The first thing sold was 27.95 and the customer got a building named after him.</UTT>I wonder if he bought a book.  I heard that Amazon started out as an online bookstore.</UTT>They did.  They used to offer so many books then they would buy it and ship to the customer.  They then started keeping stock of popular books.</UTT>I like that they keep growing though. I mean, they started out selling books and now they have a division where they publish books.</UTT>They have even owned imdb since 1998.  Its is pretty crazy how a simple bookstore grew to where you can find anything.</UTT>So true.  Now, they are helping out at people's homes with Echo devices.  Basically they are causing people to contact them daily.</UTT>Yeah, and with those devices they can help people control their lives, like playing music, and even getting wired to a house.</UTT>Yes they can.  So you can use amazon to help with your life and then use them for entertainment. After all, they've now got their own film and tv studio.</UTT>Ive read the book that details Amazon's development as well as aspects o Bezos' life.  I believe it is called the Everything Store.  It is faciniating the processes they went through.  There was even a rare book that when people wanted to order they could only get through one place that had a 10 book minimum so they ordered that 1 and 9 books that were out of print.</UTT>Really?  I'd like to read both books.  I wonder if the reason Amazon started out as a book store was because reading requires creativity and critical analysis.  Seems like both would be essential to forming a great business.</UTT>I agree.  There are even books for reading on military lists, like Enders game.</UTT>I've heard about that!  Enders Game is a fantastic movie! I've never read the book though.  The more I think about it being required reading the more I think maybe I should.</UTT>Ive seen the movie and read the book, it is good</UTT>Does the movie do the book justice?</UTT>yes</UTT>I'll have to read it soon.  Starship Troopers is another on the military's required reading list.

He was born in the same place as LeBron</UTT>Nice, maybe there is something there that makes for great players.</UTT>It could be, that is in Ohio. Do you know who Reggie Miller is?</UTT>Hmm I am not sure actually. I know that Tim Duncan stayed in school and then went to the NBA</UTT>Good for him, he managed to do both well I guess. Reggie is a great player but was always under the shadow of his sister</UTT>Wow that must have been rough. Most NBA players file for bankruptcy after they retire, that is pretty sad</UTT>Yeah that sure is. The woman went on to break 8 national records. I guess talent runs in that family</UTT>Nice one. There was a coach who was fined just because he said there should not be any games played during Christmas</UTT>Hmmm did they really have to fine him though. Iverson on the other hand seems to be doing pretty well with a contract he signed with Rebook</UTT>Did not know he was signed with Rebook. must be a nice contract there.</UTT>It sure is, they pay him $800 000 every year until he is 55 and then a lump sum of 32 million</UTT>WOw the guy is good for life then. Do you ever follow the games of Golden State Warriors?</UTT>I know they played the home games in a cow palace because their arena was booked for other stuff in 1975</UTT>Wow, cool. Their star, Curry only made the highest 4th salary in the team</UTT>Interesting and yet he is the star He also partakes in a foundation that donates mosquito nets to Africa</UTT>That is very nice of him. The GSW are looking to move to San Francisco in 2019 for the season</UTT>Oh wow I wonder why though. They earned 12 million by losing 4 games inthe last season of the NBA</UTT>Wow so win or lose they are still making  money
t_672f90a3-6da7-4297-a911-d88f7ae31f70</CONV>Did you know that facebook's like button is illegal in part of germany?</UTT>what? really?</UTT>I know! It is surprising but true.  The german state of schleswig-holstein deems the like button illegal.</UTT>zuckerburg suffers from what?</UTT>Well i don't know but I think he suffers from some sort of color blindness.</UTT>he suffers from red-grenn colorblindness</UTT>I guess that explains why facebook is blue then. I always assumed it was just someone's favorite color.</UTT>Yah I was thinking the same.</UTT>So what do you think of google?  It's a pretty powerful search engine you know. One search requires more computing power than it took to take the astronauts to the moon back in the day.</UTT>It's really big and powerful system in the world</UTT>It truly is and then again it can be kind of simple. I always wondered how  google maps knows about traffic and I recently learned it is just by seeing how fast android phones are moving on the road.</UTT>When google went down to 40%</UTT>What about google going down to 40%?</UTT>on 2013 google went down for five minutes. When a big system went down it make a big changes</UTT>Oh I totally agree with you on that.  You know, Google seems like it's been with us forever but it was just founded in 1998.</UTT>Yes every one in world use google at least once a day. When you ask some one something like address, any doubts they say" Just google it"..</UTT>Google is a part of everyone's lives.  And to think it was just a couple of Ph.D. students at Stanford that started it all.</UTT>every big thing start with a small steps. like google, apple, facebook</UTT>Yep, facebook was started when Zuckerberg was in college too.</UTT>Nice talking...:) bye</UTT>Nice chatting with you as well.  If you have an iphone you have more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent by the way!
t_8121cf40-b264-4400-9420-d713cf2af379</CONV>Hey!  Do you know why the drive thru was invented?</UTT>Hello there, I think it was back in the 70's, but I'm not sure.  Do you know?</UTT>It was, it was so soldiers could get food, they werent allowed to get out of the car in fatigues.</UTT>That is a very interesting fact, wasm</UTT>Cars sure have been around for a while. I dont know what I would do without mine.</UTT>Yeah they sure have, I think way back in 1886 the first car was made, do you know where?</UTT>I think it was actually Germany by Benz.  Then the Americans Mass produced them</UTT>Good call!  Yeah it was, and then old Ford started the mass production.</UTT>Cadillac was actually a french explorer, i didnt know that.</UTT>I didn't know that either, very interesting though.</UTT>Did you hear about the guy who beat 90,000 people in Gran Turismo</UTT>Holy cow, that is very impressive!  I wonder if they have one like that for FIFA?</UTT>I have never played either.  I hear FIFA is an incredible game though.  I have the NES, N64, and wii</UTT>That is awesome, I still have an original NES, I'll keep it for my nephews to play.</UTT>Me too.  I hooked it up the other day and played some duck hunt</UTT>That is very cool, I remember playing in my friend's basement firing at the screen.</UTT>On a totally different subject, did you know Pilgrim clothing was full color?</UTT>No I didn't know that, I would have guessed it would have been more plain.</UTT>The black and white was for formal occasions only.</UTT>Oh that is not what I have always thought, very interesting.</UTT>It is.  Great chat!  Have a great day!

He thinks that his Kung Fu Hustle is "The supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy".  I don't think I've ever seen it.</UTT>I haven't seen it either.  But I have seen Evan almighty and it is crazy that it has a budget of 200 million</UTT>Whew.  Probably for all the special animal effects.  lol  The Green Lantern was supposed to be a comedy starring Jack Black.  That probably would have been good.</UTT>I couldn't imagine it any other way that it was</UTT>I know.  I'm not sure why they changed it up.  Did you like 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv in the 1990s?</UTT>It was pretty good, but it preferred Friends</UTT>I liked Friends too along with Seinfeld and Frasier, which 3rd rock beat out all 3 of those shows in 1997 to win the Golden Globe for best comedy series!</UTT>Wow.  It has been 37 years since a comedy won best picture.</UTT>Crazy.  I was surprised to find out Comedy Central was created in 1989.  I don't remember seeing it until the mid 90s.</UTT>I probably wasn't allowed to watch it until the late 90's.  lol</UTT>lol  Nice.  They cancelled over 100 shows also since they were created.</UTT>Wow.  did you know Drew Carey served 8 years in the Marines?</UTT>I never knew that.  That's pretty neat.  He must be older than I thought he was.</UTT>It is claimed that that is where he jump started his comedy career.</UTT>That's interesting!  I loved the Drew Carey show.  I'm going to have the them song in my head now. lol  Do you know anyone that still has a rotary phone?</UTT>I don't, not a working one at least.</UTT>I haven't seen one in years now.  New York's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.</UTT>I didn't think about that.  Its been great chatting today, but I gotta run.  Have a great day!</UTT>Ok.  I have to get going too.  You also have a great day!
t_17a9085b-053e-407d-a111-75ecae10289f</CONV>Hi, are you interested in the telephone, fantasy, or William Shakespeare?</UTT>I am addicted to my phone.</UTT>Aren't we all? Did you know that our telephones convert sound, mostly our voices, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another phone which reproduces the sounds to the receiving user?</UTT>Yes, It is crazy the things they can do also.  Like the iPhone has more computing power than the US icbm deterrent.</UTT>Isn't that something?  Also speaking of phones, did you know that it's impossible to separate two phone books that have their pages overlapped together?</UTT>I have heard that, but havent seen a phone book in ages.  If I do ever find two again, I am tempted to give it a go.</UTT>Ha, ha, ha, me too.  Did you know that the cables carrying the phone and internet data across the oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor?</UTT>Yeah, that must have taken a while to set down.</UTT>I agree. Another strange fact is that Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone!</UTT>That is pretty awesome.  I wonder how to get signed up for that one, Ill have to look into it.</UTT>Yes, that sounds kind of unusual to say the least but might be worth checking out.  Speaking of unusual, did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy?</UTT>That is pretty cool.  The brain certainly is complex.  There are so many fantasy leagues, even a spelling bee and congress!</UTT>Yes, and some people are fantastic with fantasy. Did you hear about a janitor from Chicago who wrote a fantasy manuscript that had over 15K pages and 300 water color illustrations?</UTT>Yeah, He called it in the realm of the unreal.  Too bad his genius couldnt be recognized while he was alive.</UTT>Boy, I'll say.  He wouldn't have had to be a janitor then.  He would have had a higher station in life like comedic fantasy author Terry Pratchett who was knighted for his</UTT>Service to literature.  I havent read any of his works, have you?</UTT>No, I haven't. But I did find out some interesting facts about literature, Shakespeare in particular.  Did you know that Shakespeare invented the names: Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia?</UTT>I didnt know that.  I knew about some of the phrases he used being still in use today, like wild-goose chase, and full circle.</UTT>Yes, and what about 'good riddance', 'in my heart of hearts', and 'break the ice'. Who would have figured that's where those sayings came from?</UTT>True, sometimes we use a phrase so much we forget about its origin.  Or even what it really means.</UTT>I do the same thing but I do wonder where those sayings came from sometimes.  Again, the 'devil incarnate'? I would have thought some writer on TV came up with that one but no, it was Shakespeare.
t_097d2f10-37df-4914-926f-109f5fbe027d</CONV>Do you follow American politics?</UTT>Some,  I am not surprised that the first phone number in the white house was 1. lol</UTT>It definitely helped people reach the White House the fastest. I am surprised they still use floppy disks for storage.</UTT>Yes, I know.. I was surprised with that. I didn't know there was a replica of the white house in Atlanta thats a private home.</UTT>It is a beautiful building but I never would have thought to replicate it.</UTT>I agree, Jimmy Carter turning down all the therostats to 65 must have saved on the heating bills. Its such a large house.</UTT>Yes it is and it has an even larger guest house!</UTT>lol, I heard that too! Its a good thing Fred Rogers went to the senate to fund the PBS programming. Healthy child development is so important.</UTT>I have watched the video of his testimony, it's very emotional. I'm glad the Senate listened to him and valued what he had to say.</UTT>I did too, Very interesting Such a nice man. I can't believe Strom Thurmond filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes on the senate floor.</UTT>That would be all over the news today, I wonder how much coverage it got back then.</UTT>Yes, nonstop. He must have been exhausted! Very good for Harry Truman saving the government $10-15 billion.</UTT>Yes, I wish the government cared more about saving money these days.</UTT>I agree, its way out of hand! Its too bad the first presidential photograph was with Lincoln and had to have John Wilkes Booth in it.</UTT>Yes but that makes the picture even more interesting, it adds a whole layer of history into it as well.</UTT>Really,How do you feel about the last president to speak a foreign language was FDR?</UTT>I think it's a shame but I also think that it is representative that a lot of Americans only speak one language.</UTT>That's is true. I am surprised the only US president with a PHD was Woodrow Wilson.</UTT>Yes that is a surprising fact, I wonder how many had law degrees instead?</UTT>Yes, I would think a lot of them! Have a great day! Good chat</UTT>You have a great day as well.

Sorry I've never heard that song. What kind of music is it ?</UTT>Seattle quartet Kuinka plays an exuberant brand of pop music</UTT>oh ok. Sorry didn't hear that one.  Did You know that Comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989 ?</UTT>That is quite a few.     I wonder how many referred to the joke of slipping on a banana peel?</UTT>lol...  yeah, going back to green lantern - originally it supposed to be a comedy ;) what...  superhero comic book as a comedy ? Do You see that ?</UTT>Maybe.   The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance</UTT>really ? Have You ever seen ?</UTT>Yes, after I read about Northrop Frye who depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old.</UTT>wow...ok... hey... You're a dog lover ? ;)</UTT>Yes.    Did you know Dogs can learn over a thousand words and can reason better than chimps.</UTT>No I've never thought they can be THAT smart. Are we talking about all breeds or maybe there are smarter and dumber breeds ? :)</UTT>Depends, just like people.    However, Some dogs in moscow have learned to use the subway.</UTT>"learned" ? In terms of... walking behind their owner into the train ? Because I don't see them somehow buying the actual ticket ;)</UTT>Not sure.   Dogs do have 'eureka moments' and enjoy the experience of solving a problem in order to obtain a reward.</UTT>I guess, but I don't believe they understand what You mean when You point at something... from like a distance, because when You point to a food on the floor like You're almost touching it - most dogs will get it :)</UTT>True.    The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia</UTT>Yeah, I mean I've heard that, but WHO and HOW did a study on this ;) lol, or are these facts only based on a drawings in caves ;)</UTT>If nothing else, Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior</UTT>...and now we dress these majestic animals in Halloween costumes...  they probably regret that decision ;)</UTT>Perhaps, but dogs continue to perform many roles for humans.</UTT>My dogs perform holes in my backyard... :) and bark at my tenants even though they've known them for many years ;)</UTT>Spoiled then.    No hunting, herding or pulling loads for them!</UTT>I guess I did - I'm not a hunter - I couldn't kill an animal, doesn't matter how small... Maybe I'll buy some sheep for them to protect ;) You have dogs ?</UTT>Yes.    It has always amazed me how Dogs drink with the underside of their tongue</UTT>You got some weird dogs man... ;) kidding ;)</UTT>Perhaps so.     Thanks for the chat, man!

I hear it grossed over 1 billion at the box office.</UTT>that is amazing but it is a great movie so good job all around</UTT>Disney renamed one of there famed titles to tangled as well as snow queen.</UTT>yeah, apparently feminine titles do not do very very in the box office</UTT>Do you use Amazon at all. Jeff is trying to take over the world.</UTT>he sure is. he even guilt a clock in a mountain</UTT>Yeah they say it's suppose to run for 10,000 years. How about having a building named after you for being the first customer.</UTT>haha and all the guy had to do was spend less than $30</UTT>The united states postal service has a contract with Amazon.</UTT>yeah, to deliver on sundays, how convenient</UTT>Yeah but all they really do is mark the pkg as no one home. they got in trouble for that. I didn't know Amazon owned IMBD.</UTT>Yeah they purcahsed it back in 1998, they are just everywhere</UTT>Started out as an online bookstore and now they have there hand in everything.</UTT>pretty much yes. sopeaking of books, do you enjoy reading?</UTT>I do, it was nice talking with you.

I can't believe cars were invented in 1886. I thought it was in the early 1900's.</UTT>In 20th century only cars come to human uses. Firstly for the Military uses next only for civilian uses.</UTT>They were rapidly adopted in the US, and it took longer in Western Europe to be accepted.</UTT>Yes. In US only large number of people have cars compare to other part of the world.</UTT>Did you know that the car brand cadillac was named after french explorer Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac who found Detroit?</UTT>Yes. In the middle century cars reached biggest change due to technology like navigation system, air conditioning and parking alarm.</UTT>That has been so nice! I remember having to get around without a navigation system, it was so hard! What kind of car do you own?</UTT>Hyundai. What about you ?</UTT>I own a Jeep. I think it's crazy how it is legal in South Africa to put flamethrowers on your car!</UTT>I think it's the way to protect the car. The cars are propelled through internal combustion engine which have fossil fuel to run, but it create so much pollution.</UTT>It really does! Did you know that some birds navigate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?</UTT>It is very interesting. There no trees or any building to have shelter.</UTT>I'm sure they find a way to make it work. Have you ever been to Australia? There are some neat birds there.</UTT>Crows is the most intelligent birds, and sometimes it imitating human speech. Do you know ?</UTT>That would be awesome to see! I know some birds like to mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. I bet that messes with people!</UTT>Surely. Parrot is also good and Pigeon race competition is held.</UTT>That would be fun to see! Anyways, it was great chatting, have a good day!

When earth was created apparently the day was only 5.5 hours</UTT>That would be crazy! How would one nap?</UTT>I know no time for nap. And 71% of the earth is covered in water</UTT>Wow! That seems like a lot. I wonder how much is salt water like in water world.</UTT>The majority of it. Sadly, 80% of the forests have been destroyed</UTT>That does make me sad. Teddy Roosevelt was a known conservationist. He made the National park and forest service.</UTT>Wow, goof for him.  Did you know earth will be helium free by the end of the century?</UTT>Is that a bad thing? Can we make it in a lab?  Can old shoes perform better than new shoes?</UTT>Yeah apparently shoes that date back to 5000 years ago are much stronger</UTT>Maybe those cobblers can make ballet shoes. They go through 4 pairs a week!</UTT>Yeah that is a lot of shoes. Do you know how the keep them smelling fresh?</UTT>Febreeze?</UTT>Hahaha yes great option. But also tea bags</UTT>can you imagine wheelbarrowing 32000 books at 85 years old?</UTT>No but I heard Gladstone did that. What an amazing man</UTT>I would just give up... There are more libraries than mcdonalds so that is a good start.</UTT>I like that fact a lot. Have you heard of the Library of Things?</UTT>No, I have not.

The US is really strong in swimming apparently worldwide. We've won the most gold medals.</UTT>Maybe it is because of the swimsuit. There was one banned in the 2008 olympics because it was won 94% of all races.</UTT>I wonder if it did all the swimming for them?</UTT>Funny. I would think that it was the type of material it was made of but I'm not sure.</UTT>The real test would be to bind their hands and legs and make them swim in it to see how they do, like a dolphin.</UTT>The front crawl is suppose to be the fastest and most efficient stroke.</UTT>It is for my kids who swim competitively. My oldest is also pretty good at the breast stroke.</UTT>I do the freestyle which means anything to keep me from drowning.</UTT>Apparently the front crawl was introduced by Native Americans to  the early Brits who came over.</UTT>I wouldn't have thought that the Brits would be swimmers. It is cold there.</UTT>They are sailors so they need to swim some time.  At cornell university all students have to take a basic swim test. I wonder if they can doggy paddle?</UTT>I'm sure they can doggy paddle. I like to float on my back mostly.</UTT>How about Football? A Fan?</UTT>I hadn't really watch football until I started dating my ex. He loves the Patriots.</UTT>Former Patriots running back Ben Jarvis has never fumbled the football. Pretty impressive.</UTT>That is wild. Must of had glue on his hands.</UTT>Hah! Something like that.</UTT>Something like that...lol...I wonder what it was?</UTT>Luck maybe.  Anyway nice chatting!

Way cool of them.</UTT>The Dutch are building a bus that travels at 160 mph. Why would anyone want to go that fast on a bus. The Norwegians are very concerned about the earth.</UTT>Wikileaks apparently published the government's plans to destroy, well, wikileaks. That didn't work out too well...</UTT>Wikileaks is good. The government is scared of them.</UTT>Follow sports? I didn't realize that in 39 of the 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or a basketball coach.</UTT>I am not really into sports but that does impress me. I hope they are worth it.</UTT>I also did not know until recently that the US Supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor, known as the "highest court in the land"</UTT>That's funny. Given the age of a lot of those Supremes, I wonder how often it gets used?</UTT>The inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only losing coach in the history of the University of Kansas. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction!</UTT>I wonder what prompted him to invent basketball and how he came up with all of the rules. He must have had some help.</UTT>One rule that was banned for over a decade was the dunk because of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dominant use of it.</UTT>I did not know that. Head coach Joanne Boyle led the University of Virginia quit her job to go to Senegal to finalize her daughter's adoption. I think that is really brave.</UTT>I believe her daughter attends kindergarten at the Charlottesville Day School, dances ballet and hip-hop, and plays the violin.</UTT>It's too bad that they have to travel back to Africa for this and that she lost her job. They may be there for a long time.</UTT>Boyle has kept her daughter in Virginia because she has feared for her daughter's health. As a parent, I totally get and understand that.</UTT>She's lucky she has her own family to help out. But I don't know what they will do if the adoption is stalled.</UTT>This is why she resigned as coach once her team got knocked out of the NCAA Division I Tournament.</UTT>Yes, this is more important to her.</UTT>Thankfully, she has support - her 82 year old mother and 5 siblings (4 brothers & a sister) as well as a very supportive community.</UTT>That's really a good thing for her.</UTT>Pleasure talking to you!

So I can't promise that some day I won't try it, in one way or another! Ha</UTT>I have heard that too. I like playing fantasy football each year, but that's about the only one I do.</UTT>It sounds like a really fun thing to do, I'm just mostly too busy for fun. :( Fantasy congress, is a thing too!</UTT>I agree. I can't believe people do fantasy congress. That is just funny.</UTT>I wonder what all other things people draft! Speaking of fantasy, a single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving fantasy and reality! Yikes! Scary! Human's need to learn more about how fragile our bodies and especially our brains our, i think.</UTT>Wow that's very interesting. Very fragile brains. Terry Pratchett was knighted for his services to literature.</UTT>Oh wow! I wouldn't mind being Knighted! It's sounds so cool to me!</UTT>That does sound pretty cool. A comedian in Chicago wrote a 15,145 page fantasy manuscript one time.</UTT>Jeez, I hope the comedian got paid for that!</UTT>I hope so too! Do you like football?</UTT>I do like football! And soccer to a degree. But mostly football.</UTT>I do too. Do you like the quarterback position?</UTT>Yes I do! Did you know that Kellan Moore is the only left handed QB in the nfl?</UTT>I did not know that. I do remember Vick being a lefty as well.</UTT>Oh really? Personally, I'd love to be ambidextrous!</UTT>That would be cool. Did you know Alex Smith took so many AP classes in high school that he was a junior when he started college?</UTT>No, I didn't know that! I think that it's good to keep up with education, no matter what other opportunities, on may have.</UTT>I agree. In the 1960's, top bowlers made twice as much as top NFL stars.</UTT>That's crazy! I've never bowled, ever!Former Patriots RB Benjarvus Green-Ellis has never fumbled the football in his nfl career. That's a great record to have!</UTT>I can't believe he never fumbled. Pretty crazy.

I'm glad baseball season is about to start back up!</UTT>Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste.</UTT>No I didn't but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.</UTT>Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course.</UTT>Isn't Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess.</UTT>It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn't all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world.</UTT>I didn't know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I've believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers?</UTT>He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie? He must really love golf.</UTT>He really must and people must love him to allow it in his contracts!</UTT>Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? That's kind of weird.</UTT>It does sound weird.   Did you know that the ymca invented softball?</UTT>They also invented volleyball,softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball one though, pretty sure it was around before the YMCA, I could be wrong though.</UTT>I don't know. I heard somewhere that James Naismith invented basketball.  I'm not sure if he was with the ymca or not.</UTT>A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic, talk about a stroke of luck!</UTT>That is lucky!  You know, I've heard that baseball is super popular in Japan.  Over there they are surprised to learn it's our national pastime.</UTT>Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in.</UTT>No it really doesn't.  It's odd that's it's so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.</UTT>Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined.</UTT>I agree.  speaking of softball though, did you know that the longest game in college history lasted 31 innings?</UTT>Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.
t_6b52e19a-29ac-4d70-9478-de0c114f831f</CONV>Hey! How are you? Do you listen country music?</UTT>I'm good thanks for asking.  As a matter of fact I do listen to Country music.</UTT>I didn't know that there are only 2 African Americans in the hall of fame. But yes, it could be true.</UTT>Yes, I can think of Charley Pride, I'm not sure who the other person is.  Do you?</UTT>I was thinking about Charley Pride as well. It's quite obvious for me. But I have no idea who the second is. Btw, I've read opinion that country music needs more politics, not less. Do you agree with it?</UTT>No, I don't agree.  I just want to hear good music, not somebody's political views whether I agree with them or not.  JUST SING!</UTT>lol True! I agree with you. I always was thinking is country music is the best in terms of reflecting the United States. It's something special. Rock, pop, etc. are everywhere. But country music is trully American.</UTT>Did you know Country music was originally inspired and derived from Celtic music?</UTT>I knew that Celtic is part of it, but I had no idea about things like English ballads, for example. I even cannot imagine how it sounds.</UTT>The origins of Country music are the folk songs of working class Americans, who blended various different tunes, ballads,songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrants.</UTT>People in Texas will add "cowboy songs too" lol... Really nice mix!</UTT>True and don't forget Texas swing.  I love the subgenre, well.  On a side note, did you know the Fender Stratocaster was originally intended for Country music.  Isn't that hard to believe?</UTT>Yes, it's hard to believe. Just want to change topic if you don't mind... Do you watch TV?</UTT>No problem, I watch a little tv, as well.</UTT>I honestly even don't have TV home. All comes from laptop for me. Btw, I didn't know that Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.</UTT>No tv, that's kind of unusual, don't hear of that much.  Most people have at least 5 at home. Lol Yes, I can believe Fox News is very big, alot of people are sick of the anti Trump message that CNN and MSNBC spew continually.</UTT>True. My best friend has exactly 5 TV home as you said... I also didn't know that President Nixon had something to do with creation of Fox News. I didn't know that.</UTT>I din't realize that Tricky Dick had anything to do with the creation of Fox News, how interesting!</UTT>That's interesting. Well, it was to chat with you here. Have a good day!</UTT>I've enjoyed chatting with you, as well, friend.</UTT>Thanks.
t_cd5625c2-9cd3-40ab-a792-89a432a5bfa8</CONV>Hi good morning! Have you seen the movie Incredibles?</UTT>I saw the first one, but not the second.  I liked it a lot.</UTT>Nice same with me. I hope to see the second one soon. Sarah Vowell, the voice of Violet, is predominantly a political commentator!</UTT>Its crazy when you recognize their voices from elsewhere.  Did you know the director voiced Edna Mode?</UTT>I agree. Oh wow I didn't know! I didn't know that the present day events of the incredibles are set in 1960's, I thought it was more modern.</UTT>Wow.  Ill have to watch it again to see if I can pick up on that.  I too thought it was modern.</UTT>Yeah. I like other forms of entertainment too. I used to love the original Nintendo and it was finally discontinued in 2003 in Japan.</UTT>That was the best gaming system ever.  I always loved mario  brothers, even if  it was in 54 colors.</UTT>Yeah totally agree. Entertainment was originally developed and existed in many forms and were even supported by Royal Courts so it was available to all citizens.</UTT>That is good.  Did you know that Ronald Reagan was once told he didnt look presidential enough?</UTT>Wow that is very ironic! Apparently the entertainment executive clearly didn't know what he was talking about!</UTT>But apparently Bill Nye looked like Steve Martin.  He won a look alike contest and that is what launched his fame.</UTT>Oh wow that is surprising! Do you like the comedy genere? I loved comedy central and it was made back in 1989!</UTT>Yeah, comedy is one of my favorites.  Comedy Central has cancelled 100 shows since then.  Obviously they know what works!</UTT>Wow yes they do. Chapelle show was one of my favorites. The green lantern film was originally going to star jack black. He is a funny guy that would have made it interesting!</UTT>It would, it probably would have been like a Deadpool like movie.</UTT>Yeah I loved that movie too. Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the best comedy achievement in the modern era...I haven't even seen it!</UTT>Neither have I, There are so many other things that I could think of that are likely funnier than that, but that's me.</UTT>Yeah agreed, there is a ton of content out there. Do you like political satire? It is different from a parody which critiques certain genres without actually condemning them.</UTT>I do enjoy political Satire.  I feel like on the current political scene it is just too easy.  There is so much to pick from, to do it with.</UTT>Yeah it's almost like the easy way out these days because like you said it's just too easy. Have a great day :)
t_7030b13f-ab6f-4a2b-968a-a228f6ac67ac</CONV>Hello are you a fan of country music?</UTT>I cant honestly say that I am.  how about you?</UTT>It's ok.  I like the older country music.  Did you know that the Fender stratocaster was intended for country music?</UTT>Really?  That is pretty cool.  George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins.</UTT>That's a lot of cash between the two of them. lol  There are only 2 African Americans in the country music hall of fame.</UTT>I guess you dont see many African American country musicians.</UTT>I can only think of Charley Pride and Darius Rucker.</UTT>I dont think I would have even been able to name Charley Pride.</UTT>I only know his one song "Kiss an Angel Good Morning" because it was popular when I was a kid.  Henry Ford helped finance the popularization of country music due to his fears over the "urban decadence" of jazz music.  Wow.</UTT>That is kind of crazy, and somewhat racist.</UTT>I know right?  I never knew that about him.  Do you follow any celebrities?</UTT>I dont really, Id prefer to keep up with people making a contribution to society that isnt purely entertainment.</UTT>What about Sesame Street?  Carol Burnett was the first celebirty to appear on that show.</UTT>I loved it as a kid.  I still think it is great for kids.  Did she do the ear tugging thing then?</UTT>lol I remember that. Who knows?  Pixar has a secret room that is visited often by celebrities.  I wonder what's in there that it's such a big secret? lol</UTT>I wonder if there is like a secret handshake to get in too?  It has to be pretty cool if it has become noteworthy.</UTT>That's funny!  ...and I guess so. lol  Judge Judy makes $123,00 per episode making her the highest paid celebrity only after LeBron James.  I've never even watched her show.</UTT>Never?!?!  It is classic trashy TV.  If you ever want a good laugh, check it out!</UTT>lol Robin Williams in Aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.  I had a good time chatting with you!</UTT>It was a very nice chat!  Have a fantastic night!</UTT>Have a good night too!

It's really cool, that Google is a dog company!</UTT>what does it mean "a dog company" ?</UTT>I would assume like they allow dogs at work?  Maybe because dogs can learn over a 1000 words?</UTT>Not sure how is that helping Google ;)</UTT>Moral is very important in any company!  Like in a car... for google, they have a self driving car that has an aggressive mode!</UTT>I would never trust a self driving technology... what is that aggressive mode ?</UTT>Self driving technology is scary! Not scary like a horror movie though!</UTT>...but I love driving by myself... don't You ?</UTT>oh yes... it's very therapeutic for me!  Love driving till i empty the tank then going to the gas station and getting the correct side because of the little arrow by the fuel gauge!</UTT>ha ! I hear You man ! I can't believe people would actually buy a car that drives for them...</UTT>Well, people are really lazy anymore these days! At least i don't live in ohio with a stupid law where you can't warm your car!</UTT>What do You mean ? Why can't You warm Your car ?</UTT>Don't know... you will have to ask Ohio... LOL</UTT>I mean it's good for the car to warm up... silly Ohio...</UTT>yeah and who want's to get into a cold car!  You like horror movies?</UTT>love them ! :)</UTT>Love how scream was supposed to be scary movie</UTT>I didn't like "Scream" - not enough "horror" in it :)</UTT>oh wow... you love the gory stuff?</UTT>sure</UTT>yeah... i like a good horror movie as long as it has a good storyline!</UTT>I agree, story is very important ! Thank You for great chat, have a great Holidays !</UTT>thanks!</UTT>TY :)
t_5f26262e-d7a8-4edc-a21d-f0b9815eaae9</CONV>Hi there! How's it going? Are you a baseball fan?</UTT>Hi. I'm doing very well thanks. I'm do watch baseball on occasion and I'm a casual fan.</UTT>Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here.</UTT>You probably won't like this but I'm Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract.</UTT>Haha you're right I don't like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that's going to end up being a bad contract.</UTT>Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal.</UTT>By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30's and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though.</UTT>No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform.</UTT>That's true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who's their starting, Mitch Moreland?</UTT>You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres.</UTT>That's smart to front load it. It's crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It's not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey.</UTT>I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team?</UTT>They've been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It's funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed.</UTT>Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox</UTT>I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee's will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though.</UTT>I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees.</UTT>Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It's a really cool stadium.</UTT>I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing .</UTT>Well I don't know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years.</UTT>You're correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I'm not too sure about that.</UTT>I don't think they have the pitching yet. That's so important for winning the World Series. Anyway it was nice chatting with you, enjoy the rest of your day!</UTT>You're correct. It all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. I was very nice chatting with you today as well. Have a nice day!!!</UTT>Take care.
t_0186d846-2b6b-4d1c-9a1a-303c46b6323a</CONV>do you like the NFL?</UTT>Yes I do. Did you know that women can play too?</UTT>Yes there is no rule against them playing in there so they are good to try</UTT>Yes and if they quality then they will join the rest of the team</UTT>Yeah. Switching topics, the average gameplay is only 11 minutes.</UTT>I know and yet we are glued to the TV for hours during games</UTT>I know. Engineers make more than footballers too over the lifetime</UTT>Well they also have longer careers so maybe that helps a bit there</UTT>True good point. Did you hear of that rule for Saints cheerleaders?</UTT>Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players</UTT>yea and they also need to leave mid meal if they walk in</UTT>Yeah too bad it is still around. DO you like Brady?</UTT>I love him he is so good. He is popular but his wife seems to be more popular</UTT>Yes and she also makes double what he makes</UTT>Yeah. He is listed in the injury report every week by coach Belichick</UTT>Yeah. The guy has never had a strawberry in his life</UTT>Yeah strange but I guess he could also be allergic to them</UTT>Yeah that could be. He has either won or lost the super bowl with the patriots by 3 or 4 points</UTT>Yeah. Prior to 2007 he never threw 30 touchdown passes</UTT>Yeah and then had 50 after that. Nice chat tonight</UTT>Same here, have a good one
t_bb3f0dcd-e648-46fa-9425-d0170ff7ce5b</CONV>hey there, do you watch NBA?</UTT>Yes, I love to watch basketball.  How about you?</UTT>yes me too. how is your favorite player?</UTT>Cool, my all time favorite player is Kareem abdul -Jabbar.</UTT>is that the guy that got banned from using the dunk?</UTT>Yes, that was him.  The dunk was banned from college basketball for over a decade.  Too funny</UTT>I know, if they can handle it then let them. Do you know who invented basketball?</UTT>I believe that was James Naismith.</UTT>Yes. And he was also the only losing coach in the U of Kansas.</UTT>How ironic is that.  The only losing coach in the University of Kansas's history, but you invented the game.  Must have taken a lot of ribbing over that throughout the years.</UTT>Exactly. At least the coaches are the highest paid in many states</UTT>Not only the basketball coaches but football   coaches too.  Did you know that the Supreme court has a basketball court on the top floor, known as the " highest court in the land?"</UTT>I wonder if they use it a lot during their lunch breaks. Do you know what NZ basketball team are nicknamed?</UTT>Can you see Ruth Bader Ginsberg out on the court?  I heard it was the tall blacks, which is crazy.</UTT>Yes that is it. DO you know reggie miller?</UTT>Yes, he's a hall of Famer.</UTT>And apparently as good as he was, his sister was always better than him</UTT>That must have really sucked, big time.</UTT>Or maybe is was a push for him to keep trying to get better. Do you know ALlen Iverson?</UTT>Well, that's true too.  Yes, I know Allen Iverson, he was a good player.</UTT>True and he has a lifetime contract with Reebok. Nice chatting with you.
t_5024c089-a002-465f-88ad-24178e7d5363</CONV>Good morning! Do you ever shop on Amazon?</UTT>Yes, I love it!  It was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994</UTT>Hard to believe it's been around so long! For some reason it feels new to me.  You know it started out as just a bookstore?</UTT>Really thats interesting.  The first customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him.</UTT>He's a lucky man! And a smart one for buying from what was an unknown company at the time that turned in to the powerhouse it is today.</UTT>did you know that the United States Postal Service has a contract with amazon to deliver packages on Sunday</UTT>I did know that and to me, it just says exactly how powerful amazon is.  As far as I know, they are the only company that has that contract.</UTT>I think so.  I also saw that the workers for Amazons warehouse walk b/t 7 and 15 miles each dday</UTT>Well that's a good thing. It's a great way to get exercise and make money at the same time!</UTT>LOL exactly.  Did you know that Amazon passed up Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States</UTT>I believe it. I shop at Walmart but I like to shop online.  Truth is, Amazon ships UPS and Walmart doesn't.  Amazon gets stuff to you in a day or so.  Walmart doesn't do that either.</UTT>Exactly I prefer Amazon.  I just do Walmart for groceries.  I saw that Amazon is the third most valuable public company in the United States.</UTT>I guess that Google and Facebook are probably the top two.  Amazon might just move up though. They've got their own film and tv studio now.</UTT>Actually I read that they are behind Apple and Microsoft.</UTT>Really?  Well I'm wrong lol!  Well still, they might move up anyways!</UTT>Yes, they might.  They are the largest internet company by revenue in the world</UTT>And right behind Alibaba in total sales.  I wonder if that's due to the population size of China.</UTT>It might be.  I also saw that after Walmart they are the largest employer in the United States.</UTT>What do you think about the cashless stores they are starting up?</UTT>Well I guess most people dont carry cash so it makes sense.  I was reading that IMBD has been owned by Amazon since 1998.  I didn't know that</UTT>I didn't know that either.  Sounds like amazon got into expanding early on. They were only a 4 year old business when they did that.  Well, I've got to go for a bit.  It's been nice chatting with you!  Have a great day!
t_49c54773-305e-419f-a73c-54ef3801f112</CONV>Greetings! I hope you are well. These readings were certainly interesting!</UTT>Hello, how are you?  Do you like to read?  To me, reading is a simple word but the scientific definition that I read from an article sounded complex.</UTT>Yeah, we don't have think about reading once we do it well, so it's kind of interesting to think about it. Are you an avid reader?</UTT>I used to but I have been busy with work, grand kids, etc.  Apparently, in the 18th century there was a moral panic because people began to enjoy reading novels.</UTT>Yeah, that cracks me up.  I also like the idea of CS Lewis JRR Tolkien having a "you laugh you lose" competition.  I used to be a real book nerd, but now I'm mostly reading on the internet.</UTT>I read mostly on the internet too.   Yes, I heard about CS Lewis and the competition your were talking about.</UTT>All the articles were interesting. I had no idea the Sun accounts for 99.86% of our solar system.  Our little planet is pretty insignificant.</UTT>It is scary, isn't it?  I did not know that the sun is actually white.  I thought it was yellow.</UTT>It would be amazing if we could capture the power of lightening bolts. Dr. Frankenstein had the right idea.</UTT>Apparently, they are hotter than the surface of the sun.  I always thought that the surface of the sun was the hottest thing in the universe.</UTT>Even scarier, the next biggest star is a billion times the size of our sun.</UTT>Our sun is so tiny.  I'm not going to think about it.  It's way to scary.</UTT>So</UTT>I think you were trying to say something.  Apparently professional soccer makes more money than football, baseball, golf, basketball, and hockey combined.  How can it be?</UTT>S</UTT>Hello, are you still there?</UTT>Yes, my text box keeps disappearing. Sorry about that! I was trying to ask if you're a soccer fan.</UTT>I'm more into football but I watched some games on tv with my boss.  He is from England.  I like it that soccer is less harmful to players than football.</UTT>I didn't grow up around soccer, so I never really became a fan. It didn't make it to my backwater Indiana town.</UTT>Mesut Ozil, A German soccer player, donated his EU300,000 victory bonus to pay for poor children's surgeries in Brazil.  It was very nice of him.</UTT>I guess that part about soccer making more money than any sport is true. Yet, I've never seen a pro game in the U.S.</UTT>I've got to run now.  It was nice chatting with you.  Have a good night.

Were you into the big gangnam style phase? That song almost broke youtube</UTT>That song was catchy as heck.  I played my fair share.  Did you know that Youtube and Netflix make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America?  People love their videos!</UTT>That makes sense, you only hear people talk about youtube or netflix. Do you ever catch television shows?</UTT>I do watch the telly!  Even watched them in black and white when I was a kid!</UTT>WOW! that would have been interesting. I need my color TV. Did you ever watch pokemon?</UTT>I never did but my kids watched it a lot and still do even though their grown!  lol  I'm pretty sure they've seen all 750 episodes of it.</UTT>I think I watched a majority of those as a kid. Did your kids watch Thomas the Train?</UTT>Yes they did.  Who was the voice of Thomas?</UTT>There were many different, Ringo starr, george carlin, and alec baldwin along with many others</UTT>That's right!  I remember Ringo and George now.  Not Alec though. lol  Did you ever watch that 70s show?</UTT>I used to love watching that show, its on netflix and youtube still. Do you?</UTT>I did.  If you go on youtube you can find all 10 epiodes that the British remade of it called "Days Like These"</UTT>That is hilarious, that poor show! Almost like that 80s how that probably lasted that long too!</UTT>lol Nice.  Did you know that there is only 1 episode of the Simpsons where bart was neither mentioned or appears?</UTT>That is so crazy, also the simpsons sent south park flowers when they made their famous family guy episode. Good chatting with you!</UTT>I didn't know that they did that.  I'll have to look it up on youtube for sure!  ...and good to chat with you too!</UTT>Have a great weekend!

DId you know Lincoln was the first president that had a photo taken during the inauguration</UTT>Nice. THe president of Indonesia is a pop star</UTT>WOw nice. In the photo with Lincoln was also the John Wilkes booth</UTT>WOw. The Indonesia guy has already released three albums</UTT>WOw good for him. Did you know in Guatemala relatives of the president cannot run for that position ever?</UTT>Nice, I guess that is how they combat issues with nepotism and such</UTT>Maybe. DO you know that congress can declare someone a honorary citizen?</UTT>Nice, did not know that. The republicans and democrats play a game of baseball every year since 1909</UTT>Nice, are they keeping score on who is winning?</UTT>Yes the republicans are currently leading by three points</UTT>Nice. Steven Colbert is a supporter of work visas for immigrants and once went in front of the congress to defend that</UTT>Wow that is amazing. Elmo also testified in front of COngress once?</UTT>Elmo as in Elmo from Sesame Street?</UTT>Yes and it is the only non human to testify</UTT>Wow cool.

t_0df4fef4-c890-43aa-b435-59f8eb502a0f</CONV>Do you follow the US senate?</UTT>I do somewhat.  I know that there is 100 US senators.  2 from each state.</UTT>Yeah, thats the  way it has been for a long time at least, the senate chamber is located in the capitol</UTT>Senator Strom Thurmond holds the record for the longest filibuster by a lone senator.  He stayed on the floor for an incredible 24 hours and 18 minutes non stop!</UTT>He does? that is an odd record lol, you know that the US senate used the same Gavel for almost 2 centuries until Nixon cracked it.</UTT>Wow.  That's a long run!  It must be in a museum somewhere.  The reason Harry Truman was selected to be vice president was because when he ran the senate "Truman committe", it found so much corruption and waste that he saved the govt 10 to 15 billion dollars!</UTT>I guess thats a great reason, b¿he undercovered a big secret, most would remain quiet</UTT>I agree.  Did you know that the only US president to have a PHD is Woodrow Wilson?  That kind of surprises me.</UTT>That is suprising, I would guess most former presidents had one,</UTT>Me too.  5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote.  Never quite understood why we don't use the popular vote.</UTT>Its a weird system, maybe that can be changed one day, just like back in 1805 the runner up of an election would become vice president</UTT>Could you imagine that happening now?  Trump and Hillary?  lol</UTT>That would be caos, nothing would get done.</UTT>It would be chaos. Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and John Wilkes Booth was in that photo.  I never knew that.  Creepy.</UTT>That is creepy considering he got shot by him later, did you kno wthe White House has two twin buildings!!</UTT>I know!  ..and I didn't know that about the buildings.  I wonder why?  I know the first phone of the White House was simply 1.</UTT>It was? I had no idea about that, well the White House sure has some curious and cool facts</UTT>It does!  Who knew?  lol  There is a replica of the White House in Atlanta which was built as a private home!</UTT>Really I heard about the ones in Ireland and France never knew there was in Atlanta as well,</UTT>I didn't know either!  Did you know you can mail a birth announcement to the White House and they'll send you a congratulations card back?  Wish I would have known that when my kids were born.  Neat.</UTT>Oh thats so cool, I will do that next time Im expecting a kid.

Did you hear of the deal Iverson signed with Reebok?</UTT>Did not, did they make him a good offer?</UTT>Yes the guy is set for life, trust me. Do you like LeBron?</UTT>I do actually. Did you know he refused an offer from Reebok for $10 million when he was 18?</UTT>WOw how come ? He is going to be in the Space Jam movie sequel</UTT>Yes because he said Nike or Adidas will offer him more so he did not settle for that</UTT>Wow he knew his self worth did he get a better offer then?</UTT>Yes Nike offered him $90 million the next year</UTT>Nice, good deal then , Did you know he is the highest paid  celebrity?</UTT>Nice, he is involved in many things so I guess that makes sense</UTT>Yeah. He once raised $6 million when he televised the decision, it was all for charity</UTT>Nice. He was really hated in 2012 when he decided to join MIami Heats</UTT>Wow I guess people did not like him leaving his old team
t_4c15be3b-c4ad-4909-ab4e-aefb800bc3f1</CONV>Good morning, do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Hello there, I do listen to the radio, mostly when I am driving to and from work.  How about you?</UTT>I listen to satellite radio in the car, not so much the regular AM/FM anymore.</UTT>I have gone on a few road trips in cars where they had satellite radio, it is very cool, so many stations to choose from.</UTT>Yes it seems like they have a station for every type of music you could possibly want. I like the variety because you get tired of hearing the same songs over and over.</UTT>Yeah the variety is really good.  Did you know that in Canada, all music played over the radio has to be at least 40% Canadian bands and acts?</UTT>That's a great rule to help support local artists. I wonder who gets the job to monitor that?</UTT>I agree!  I don't know how much the Canadian public likes it, but it is really good for all those local bands.</UTT>I'm sure it's not even that noticeable because you don't really think of the nationality of the artists when you're listening to a song. There's a station in Finland that airs a weekly Latin news program.</UTT>That is true, I think a lot of the music I listen to doesn't come from the US.  And really thats pretty cool!</UTT>It's important to expose yourself to different cultures and music is an easy and fun way to do that. I know that I've enjoyed listening to a lot of acts from different parts of the world.</UTT>Very true again.  Do you know what soldiers used to call the small radios they would make during WWII?</UTT>No, it is really amazing at how a radio can be made out of the smallest and craziest items.</UTT>Yeah it sure is, I guess they were called, 'foxhole' radios if I'm correct.</UTT>They were made with bits of pencil and razors, it's very impressive that they made them in a way that they were functional.</UTT>Yeah it really was.  What is also impressive is the radio storms on the planet Jupiter.</UTT>I would love to hear what those sound like on the radio. I wonder if they sound similar to static?</UTT>I agree, I wonder if there is a site you have to go, or if there is a certain frequency you can tune in to hear that.</UTT>That's something I definitely intend to research. Do you listen to podcasts?</UTT>I have not gotten into podcasts yet, but would like to. Do you have any suggestions where to begin?</UTT>I listen to a few true crime podcasts and few interview based ones. I would recommend Stuff They Didn't Teach You and 99% Invisible. It was fun talking with you, have a great day!
t_345f04e3-2bd4-4505-90e9-cc58f74895a2</CONV>Good afternoon! How are you today?</UTT>I'm good.  Thanks for asking and you?</UTT>very well thank you! I have heard a few interesting factoids as of late and would like to share with you some of them!! Do you know in south Africa it is legal to install flame throwers on your car to help prevent car-jackings?</UTT>Sounds cool, I'd like to mount some on my car for my daily commute in traffic.  Lol</UTT>That is funny, you must live in a big city with lots of traffic. Did you know that Mc Donalds opened the drive through in 1975 to accommodate soldiers that were not allowed to get our of their car because of their uniforms?</UTT>That was nice of them.  It transformed the fast food industry, for sure.  I wonder what the inventor of the modern car, Karl Benz would think of how his invention was being used?</UTT>I am sure it did as I too find myself some days not in uniform of any kind not wanting to get out of my car and find drive through much easier!  something else supposed to stand the test of time ( no pun intended there, lol)</UTT>True, I reda somewhere that Google's self driving cars have an " aggressive" mode.  That sounds kind of unsettling and unnerving to me.</UTT>Yea, that in it's self sounds scary! Whole new meaning to road rage if you ask me!!  I wonder how it would do on the autobaun ?</UTT>I heard when Audi entered the Indian market they had to create a new horn to withstand the constant use.  I can't even imagine.  I'd def need that flamethrower, I'd light them up!</UTT>Too funny! Some days are easier getting around than others that is for sure! I find it funny that a person beat 90,000 other players on a video game called Gran Turismo and became a race car driver as a result.</UTT>Hey, he's got some skills, that's alot of people.  I'll be glad when Winter is over, I live in Ohio and it's illegal to warm your car up here.Been freezing my ying yangs off here, lately!</UTT>So you cannot warm up your car, by sitting it with it running or turning it on and going back inside? That's crazy and totally understand but can't sympathize much as I am in Florida and it has been pretty warm here, it gets below 65 and I am freezing so I can't imagine your cold.</UTT>Well, it's cold by all means, I'm glad you're somewhere warm, my friend.</UTT>Thank you! I have lived in the North but was much younger when the bones could take it. I have not owned a good heavy winter coat in probably fifteen years now.</UTT>Oh, wow.  I'm going to go South when I retire.  Getting too old for this.  If I could be like that man in NewYork and find alot of classic cars in an old barn that are worth millions, I could get there sooner!</UTT>Probably have a better chance of winning the lottery to get here quicker, lol. I spend a lot of time at the beach reading. I have an Amazon Kindle I take as I don't have to worry about sand in the pages that way and if I finish a book there I am able to get another pretty quickly by downloading. Do you read often?</UTT>Yes, a s amatter of fact I do read quite a bit.  I find Amazon's new font called " Bookerly that was specifically designed to be easy to read on kindles,to be just that. Reading is a breeze.</UTT>Do you know Amazon's CEO built a clock into the side of a mountain that should run for more than 10 thousand years?</UTT>Wow, that's interesting.  Haven't heard that before. Founder Jeff Bezos is a billionaire, so anything is possible, I guess?</UTT>I feel Amazon has a dabble into most aspects of everyday living including Sundays as the have a contract with the USPS to deliver packages on Sundays! For one that likes to get mail, that makes me happy.</UTT>I've heard that before, but I have never gotten a package on a Sunday.  Well, anyway, it's been nice chatting with you this afternoon, friend.  Get out and enjoy your Florida sunshine and know that I'm jealous!  Enjoy the rest of your day.
t_ea696862-c5c7-4a3b-ad92-4ac59e54679a</CONV>Hi, do you like comedy?</UTT>I do!  Did you know that Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern comedy age!</UTT>I love Bill Murray, but I'm not too sure about his opinion on Kung Fu Hustle. Have you seen that movie?</UTT>I haven't seen it.  I take that it isn't too good?  lol</UTT>It wasn't very funny I don't think. Did you know Jack Black was originally going to be in the Green Lantern film?</UTT>I saw that.  I think it would have been really fun with him in it!</UTT>Me too. Did you know comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989?</UTT>I didn't know that.  Did you like 30rd Rock from the Sun?</UTT>I do like it. I saw that it beat out Seinfeld, Frasier, and Friends for a Golden Globe once.</UTT>Yes.  Do you like listening to albums?  I started listening to them in the 1970's but stopped once cassettes came along.</UTT>I love listening to albums. Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory album is the best selling of the 21st century.</UTT>I always wondered what the biggest selling album was since the turn of the century.</UTT>There are two identical twins in Japan that released a rap album at 100 years old.</UTT>That is sweet.  What a way to celebrate!  NWA's Straight Outta Compton was the first album to reach platinum status without the support of airplay or a major tour!</UTT>That's pretty cool! Do you know much about Earth?</UTT>The Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago.</UTT>Wow that's a long time ago. More than 80% of the Earth's forests have been destoyed.</UTT>That's sad.  Earth will be virtually helium free by the end of the 21st century.  I bet Buck Rodgers didn't see that coming.</UTT>That's scary. I wonder what impact that will have other than filling up balloons?</UTT>I'm not sure what will happen.  When Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long.</UTT>That's a very short day. Well, it was good talking to you!
t_252a51f4-de64-448c-b587-dba65c0ce4c1</CONV>Good morning. How are you? Don't you just love the Internet? It is actually addictive with measurable changes in the brain.</UTT>Based on that little bit of info I'm not sure that I do love it.  Not sure I could without the internet though.</UTT>Yes it is very important. It carries a vast range of information from documents and applications to electronic mail and file sharing.</UTT>When using the internet I find myself on Youtube most often, watching more videos than I really should</UTT>I love youtube. Created back in 2005 it wasn't always so big but sure is now!</UTT>I guess it's the whole thing of having videos on demand.  I even find myself watching concert on Youtube.</UTT>Oh nice I've never watched a concert on YouTube. Although I did watch Justin Bieber's baby video on YouTube and it is the most dislike video on there.</UTT>I suspect that is more to do with people being jealous of his popularity than a dislike of that individual video, I seen far worse than that.</UTT>True. I was surprised to hear that YouTube is the second largest search engine on the net, I wonder what the first one is? Google?</UTT>I would assume you a right there.  There seems little you can't find on Youtube now, I wonder just how many cats videos have been uploaded to it now.</UTT>Yes cat videos are definitely more popular than dog videos! Police actually have their own YouTube called blue tube.</UTT>Never heard of that one, can't be that popular.  I typically stick to music videos, and concerts.  I rarely get to go to concerts so Youtube is the next best thing.</UTT>Concerts are a lot of fun. I prefer the smaller concerts and nightclub as opposed to big arenas or large parks. It is more intimate.</UTT>I totally agree.  It's nice to get up close to the person or band you want to see rather than being hundreds of feet away.</UTT>Exactly. In Croatia there is an ancient Roman amphitheater that is still in use as a concert venue. That would be a cool place to see a concert.</UTT>Yes, there are some really cool places that bands have played in the past.  I not sure how I feel about paying money to watch a hologram sing though.</UTT>Yeah I probably wouldn't want to pay money for that either it's basically watching a concert on the screen. The Ramon's played a total of 2263 concerts. They toured almost nonstop for 20 years. Must've been very tiring.</UTT>That's a lot of shows.  It's impressive for people but not holograms.  You would ave to just press the repeat button and it would keep on playing night after night.  Could play in multiple places at once too.</UTT>Yes that's a good point I bet that will happen more in the future. Did you hear about the Creed concert in 2002?</UTT>Is that the one where people sued to get their money back.  Maybe Creed should just make a hologram of their best concert and replay it and not take the chance of upsetting their fans.</UTT>Yes it must have been a bad concert! Not like The Ramones or Linkin Park! Well it was great talking to you this morning!</UTT>Same here.  I'll be logging into Youtube to see if I can find that Creed concert and see how bad it was.  Good bye.</UTT>Yes definitely! Have a good one.
t_e2de6582-ed0d-4827-9da0-e4b6dab6d414</CONV>I love working on my computer.  I got my first one back in the late 70s</UTT>I got mine sometime in the late 90s! I was in grade school and it was exciting to own one. The first computer algorithm was written by Ada Lovelace.</UTT>Yes Ada did a lot.  I was lucky we never smoked - it would have voided the warrenty on our macs.</UTT>Around the time my family got their first computer, Windows 95 was the 2nd most installed piece of software. The first was Doom. I'm pretty sure I had 98 though.</UTT>Nice.  Did you know that someone once built a working computer using the building blocks of minecraft?  crazy</UTT>I didn't know that and that's very interesting. The first Google compute at Stanford was housed in custom made enclosures made from Legos.</UTT>I love Legos!  The Russians even made one out of water - I have no idea how!</UTT>I love Legos too! And how did they accomplish that? I have to look into it. I just learned that CAPTCHA actually stands for something- completely automated public tuning test to tell computers & humans apart! That's a mouthful.</UTT>Wow that is a mouthful.  Maybe I should just upload my mind to my Mac like the transhumanists want to do</UTT>That would help me remember things! Radios are amazing technology too. There's a radio station that translates solar activity into sound, so you can listen to music from the sun.</UTT>That is cool.  I was surprised to learn that Jupiter has radio storms so loud you can pick them up on AM radio</UTT>That's amazing. Did you know Bill Murray voiced Fantastic Four's Human Torch in the 70s?</UTT>No I had never heard of that.  I knew soldiers in WWII made radios using a razorblade and a pencil - very creative</UTT>That's extremely resourceful. a song by Hanson became the most requested song on a radio station because the DJs didn't reveal the artist! ha those are the Mmmbop guys.</UTT>Smart djs!  I love going to the website where I can listen to old classic radio dramas for free.  War of the worlds is a great one</UTT>Oh yeah that's the one where listens who tuned in late thought aliens were actually attacking the Earth right?</UTT>Thats the one!  A big deal!  Sounds a lot better than the finish station which broadcasts in Latin</UTT>I meant "listeners," sorry. It must have been really believable! One of the most popular radio acts was actually a ventriloquist in the 30s.</UTT>A ventriloquist?  On radio?  That is unique..  I wonder if he was Canadian - their stations have to have at least 40% of music be canadian</UTT>Yep, that fact even baffles contemporary critics. I'm a big fan of poetry and there's a 274 line poem called Chaos because there are 800 irregularly pronounced English words.</UTT>Wow!  That is insane.  That is a lot of words.
t_dcd0b3c1-f4df-4333-b707-57d707b37a27</CONV>hi, do you like reading?</UTT>Yes, Reading makes our brain more active.</UTT>yup for sure, do you ever go on wikipedia?</UTT>Yes, Reading is a means for language sharing information and ideas.</UTT>yeah, in wiki they have superheroes ranked according to their powers</UTT>The reading process requires continuous practice, development and taking notes about the subject. It is easy to remember.</UTT>do you know who wrote the oldest known cybord in a fiction?</UTT>No, Its good exercise to brain and now days, reading habit is much reduced. please all in social media.</UTT>have you read starship trooper?</UTT>Yes. Its very interesting.</UTT>do you go to concerts?</UTT>Yes, A concert is a live music performance in front of an audience.</UTT>have you been to any?</UTT>I went to shakira. She dance very beautifully.</UTT>nice. do you know the ramones?</UTT>Yes, The American punk rock brand.</UTT>yeah, do you know how many years they toured for?</UTT>May be 20 years.</UTT>yeah and in that time they had 2263 concerts</UTT>Its very interesting.</UTT>Yeah. nice chatting with you
t_4913619d-d984-4627-acb2-dda67d6eb458</CONV>Hi, how are you? Have you seen the movie Incredibles II?</UTT>Hello!  I have!  Good sequel to the orginal one that came out in 2004.  Did you see it?</UTT>No, I didn't. Interesting choices for voice talent though. Edna Mode, the superhero costume designer in The Incredibles, is voiced by Brad Bird, the film's director. Bird voiced Edna during storyboarding sessions, after which the production team couldn't find an actress who could do the voice better than him.</UTT>Neat story!  The girl who played the voice of Violet is Sarah Vowell.  She's also a bestselling author of historical nonfiction!</UTT>Quite a talented person! The present day events of the Incredibles are set in the 1960s. That’s a great period for clothing and architecture.</UTT>I agree.  I like finding vintage items from that era.  When they were making the movie the directer used artists that he thought were either likely to quit or get fired from Pixar.  He must have thought they would have extra motivation to produce better work so they could save their jobs?</UTT>That would be my guess. He knows quality. I also figure they invest a lot in the scripts and casting because so much has to go into the animating.</UTT>Yes.  I didn't realize that there was actually a sequel that came out in video game form called "The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer".  Did you ever hear of that?</UTT>No, I haven't. I guess people just couldn't wait for the movie. For marketing, it’s better to strike while the iron is hot.</UTT>Yes.  Speaking of video games...did you ever have a Nintendo back in the day?</UTT>No, I did not. I played video games as kid, but not NES.. Now, I don't have the time.</UTT>I don't have the time either.  The original system could display only 54 colors.</UTT>The NES was all about great game play.It  was finally discontinued in September of 2003 in Japan.</UTT>I lost interest and time in the mid90s somewhere.  Did you know that Ronald Reagan was once turned down for a movie role because he didn't fit the look of a president for the role?  How ironic.</UTT>I wonder what the presidential look was back in those days. Maybe he needed better makeup. LOL</UTT>LOL  Do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?</UTT>Yes, I do. He's great! Good ambassador to science.</UTT>Yes!  He was discovered by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest!</UTT>That's great! The man has varied talent. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day!</UTT>You have a good day as well!  It was a pleasure!  One more quick question before we go.  Do you like comedies by any chance?</UTT>Yes, I do like comedies. They are funny, and so am I. So we get along very well.</UTT>Awesome!  I love them too!  Have a great day!
t_8e230804-abff-4198-90a3-ee6a6df4af7c</CONV>I find the idea that universes evolve through natural selection fascinating. I guess this refers to the idea of a multiverse that's constantly percolating new universes out?</UTT>Yes I think so. The universe sure is interesting.</UTT>Yeah, I've seen dumbed-down explanations of physicists' theories in pop science journals' saying that each one of those new universes that pops out as a big bang or while hole has its own laws, and the ones with laws that function well give birth to new universes on a similar pattern</UTT>Yeah sorry my last response was cut off early haha. But yes the universe is super interesting, and I even saw there is a theory that we exist inside a black hole. I wonder how that would even work</UTT>Same. Unfortunately my hard science education was lacking. One of these days I intend to read all the major popularized works on modern physics (Dancing Wu Li Masters, Tao of Physics, etc.) so I can at least get the Sunday supplement version.</UTT>Haha that's a good idea. Did you hear that there may be a parallel universe? There's a cold spot in the microwave background that scientists detected in space, and they think there's a parallel universe in there. I wonder if I will ever meet my parallel self haha</UTT>Wild. I never saw that. I love alternate history science fiction though. Do you?</UTT>I do like alternate history stuff, I think it's very fascinating. How many times have you ever folded a piece of paper in half? Apparently 103 is the maximum amount of times that anyone could do it</UTT>I've never tried. I wonder if it wouldn't depend on the size of the paper you started with, though?</UTT>I don't think so. I think it's just an overall rule. Have you ever played a video game before?</UTT>Long, long ago -- like in the Pac Man and Space Invaders era. I never saw the appeal to be honest. How about you?</UTT>I used to play a lot of video games. But I don't really anymore. I played a lot when I was a kid. For instance I played the N64 game GoldenEye. Apparently a lot of the developers of that game that never even worked on a game before</UTT>When was that?</UTT>I think it came out in like 1997. I don't know if you ever play the N64 but it was a great system. Have you ever heard of the Mortal Kombat games</UTT>I've heard of them and vaguely recall there being a movie based on them.</UTT>Yep there's a movie and a whole bunch of games. The first movie is good but the second one is horrible. I never really played the games, but they were very violent and they are the reason for the rating system that we currently have in video games</UTT>Wow -- I should google that. Reminds me of how the comics code came about in the 50s.</UTT>Yep it's the same kind of idea actually. And I know that Australia bans a lot of games. Which I think is funny, because they ban more games than even China</UTT>I wonder how it is in the EU.</UTT>The EU also bans stuff, or they at least sensor games but not as badly as Australia. Have you ever been to a Chuck-E-Cheese before?</UTT>Never ate there -- I remember when they were called Showbiz and they had the hillbilly bears
t_19ce0569-600f-4d92-b796-6f4afb897654</CONV>Hello there, are you a fan of the Nintendo system?</UTT>Hey.  I had one about 30 years ago if that counts lol.  Are you?</UTT>Yeah that does, I had a best friend who had one back then as well, so I basically had one as well.</UTT>Did you ever have an atari?</UTT>No, but we had an Ntelevision I think it was called, it was the cheaper version I think. How about you?</UTT>Yep, I sure did.  The games were very simple but a lot of fun.  Apparently, there is an Atari video game landfill.  A documentary is being made about it</UTT>That would probably be very interesting to watch.  I remember getting countless hours of fun out of that old system with my older brother and sister.</UTT>I didn't know this: The NFL is recognized as an entertainment business rather than a sport, just like the wwe.  I wonder why?</UTT>That is very interesting, I wonder why?  Sounds kind of fishy to me, like they control who will be winning or something?</UTT>Right!  It's all staged like wrestling lol.</UTT>Exactly! Oh man I don't think certain fans like the Saints fans would want to hear something like that!</UTT>Nope, they sure wouldn't want to hear that.  There would be riots!</UTT>Yeah there would, there would be people trying to sue them because they spent money on tickets or hotels or something like that I'm sure.</UTT>Totally agree.  Ever watch horror films? Not a single person involved with filming the Exorcist thought it was a horror film.  What did they think they were making lol</UTT>I do like to watch them, and really!?  That is just too funny, yeah I wonder what kind of movie they thought they were doing?</UTT>Yeah, maybe they thought it was a documentary or something lol.  Horror movies can be a lot of fun to watch.</UTT>Yeah you might be right, and did you read how many calories you can burn just by watching them?</UTT>No, I didn't.  But that's a killer workout!</UTT>Yeah it is, just by watching lol.</UTT>I never saw Inception, but that was supposed to be a horror film originally</UTT>That is crazy, that movie is just crazy in general.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day.
t_83629c81-49e8-4d84-9973-114899d254e1</CONV>Do you like youtube?</UTT>I'm on it quite a lot.  My kids still like Psy's Gangnam Style video.  So weird.</UTT>lol what a great dance! I heard that song almost broke youtube!</UTT>Can't believe how popular that was.  My daughter's also a Justin Bieber fan.  I'm unfortunately am not so we get into arguments sometimes about what she's watching.</UTT>lol I disliked that video when it came out, I am with a lot of people because that is the most disliked video on youtube lol</UTT>You're talking about Bieber's song "baby?"   Yeah, I didn't like that song either.  I've been trying to find older albums on youtube.  Stuff like Linkin Park or Reel Big Fish.</UTT>yea, terrible song lol. I loved Linkin Park, especially Hybrid Theory</UTT>I heard it's the best-selling album of the 21st century.  You listen to anything in particular?</UTT>Just rock and some rap here and there. How about you</UTT>Been trying to revisit some older rap groups.  I was pretty square in my younger days so didn't listen to it much.  Was told NWA's Straight Outta Compton is a classic.</UTT>I loved NWA's straight outta compton, nothing better than being a high schooler back in the day bumping that lol! They went platinum</UTT>Yeah, didn't know how well that album did.  I used to like beatboxers.  Always found that fascinating, how they could create all those rhythms without any accompaniment.</UTT>for sure, I practiced that and got decent at it and busted it out sometimes at parties lol. Did you ever hear about the twins from japan who released an album at 100?</UTT>That sounds awesome.  I've got to look that up.  Seem like it of "cultural significance" for many cultures!  I think rap's even pretty big in Korea.</UTT>I heard about Korean rap, they have rap battles that are compliment battles. I would like to see that</UTT>That sounds cool.  Guess rap is a legitimate form of music.  I know my dad hated it.  But hey, the Library of Congress seems to think it's a worthy art form.  Think they deemed Tupac's music as culturally significant.</UTT>That is a good feat by Tupac, making rap music significant. My dad hated it too lol. Did you ever watch the rugrats movie, Busta Rhyme was the voice of Reptar</UTT>Really? That was the dinosaur thing right?  Kind of "bad boy." Speaking of which, isn't that the name of P. Diddy's record label?  Sorry like I said, I'm pretty square.</UTT>Yea lol, the dinosaur. I think it is lol, bad boy records. It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>Nice chatting with you as well.  Gonna go look up some LL Cool J and Run DMC now.  Take care.</UTT>I will too! loved those rappers! Enjoy your weekend!
t_6a2e7e43-d365-4be7-a8dc-ca8f32af9853</CONV>Hey how are you doing, you a big Natalie Portman fan?</UTT>Hi! Hope you're doing well!  I am a huge fan of Natalie Portman! But I am surprised that she was upstaged by Raffey Cassidy in Vox Lux. I've never even heard of the young actress! What about you?</UTT>I've never heard of her either, I'm sure she's got to be good to upstage Natalie Portman. Very cool. What is Vox Lux? Is it a movie?</UTT>It is an R rated film that I've heard is disappointing. Unfortunately, they say it doesn't really have the energy to say anything interesting or really anything that makes sense, which is disappointing!</UTT>For sure for sure. You listen to a lot of music by chance too? Either in person at a concert or download and buy albums?</UTT>I actually love the album Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park! In fact, it is the best selling album of the 21st century and I can see why because it's so amazing! What about you?</UTT>It's a fun album, I definitely listened to it a lot in the mid 2000s, I think that is when it first came out. NWA was a great group too, the movie was really good.</UTT>Agreed. Did you also know Straight Out Of Compton was the first album to hit platinum status despite no airplay support or major tours? That is really impressive!</UTT>Wow, definitely really impressive, especially with the challenges they faced. Reel Big Fish re-recorded all their hits for an album, I never knew people liked them that much. Do you like them></UTT>I didn't know people liked them either as I had never heard of them. Can you believe The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of best selling albums in 2014 despite being released over 40 years ago? That goes to show good music never dies!</UTT>Oh wow, that's crazy. I wonder if it won any of the other years in between?  Wonder if Judge Judy bought it with her money she makes !</UTT>Ha! She could afford several albums making $123k per episode, couldn't she? Crazy to think she's the highest paid celebrity, second to LeBron!</UTT>Oh wow, I really didn't know that. LeBron is about to be a billionaire, that's crazy, happy for him!</UTT>Indeed. He deserves it! I wonder if he's visited Pixar's secret room that celebrities often visit?</UTT>Me too, I wish I could go see it. It'd be cool to just see the celebrities there haha.</UTT>No kidding! Ha! I tell you something I would have like to have seen in person is that concert Creed put on back in 2002 that was so godawful, a few fans in attendance actually filed a lawsuit against Creed. I can't imagine a concert being that bad. Ha!</UTT>Haha, I can't remember being at that bad of a concert. Pink Floyd played in 1972 to the ancient roman amphiteather, that'd have been wild.</UTT>Agreed it would have! Another one that would have been wild to see was The Ramones while they played a grand total of 2,263 concerts almost nonstop over the course of 20 years!</UTT>Oh wow, I wonder how they got the "energy" to do all that lol.</UTT>Thats a good question as it had to take a serious toll on them! Just like Linkin Park, I wonder where they got the energy to play 324 concerts in a single year back in 2001?  Of course, it was due to the success of their debut album, so perhaps they were motivated by success!</UTT>Oh wow, that's nuts. I'm going to take off though, great chatting with you! Take care!
t_f62e68de-aaf1-4cb5-b5be-9ee40e5cd6d9</CONV>Hello there, do you like Netflix?</UTT>Hi! I love Netflix! I wonder if they have that new tv show called Grownish on it?</UTT>Oh actually I do not know but it is such a convenience nowadays. Do you know how it came about?</UTT>I believe they were a rental service? And then expanded to streaming content.</UTT>Yeah, the founder was mad that he had to pay a late fee at blockbuster</UTT>oh, YES! I remember that story, I heard it on my telephone radio one day while driving in my car.</UTT>Nice. Did you know Blockbuster could have bought it back then and did not</UTT>I did hear about that, declining several offers! Silly choice! Now Netflix is worth 2 billion!</UTT>Yeah that is true. Yet though they still spend more on postage than on bandwidth</UTT>That's just crazy! But what isn;t crazy these days. Like it is impossible to separate 2 old phone books, a bit of trivia!</UTT>Yeah that is actually quite funny. Did you ever use a rotary phone?</UTT>I actually used a rotary phone growing up, I am so happy they have new technology!</UTT>Yeah for sure. They are the reason why NY's area code is 212</UTT>Cool! Didn't know that one. I still find it fascinating that we can talk to each other through electronic signals transmitted through wire....so weird when you really think about it.</UTT>It is indeed. And there miles upon miles of those cables in the bottom of the ocean</UTT>I heard that, the telephone is so awesome. I remember when we would laugh about it when people said, one day we will be able to see each other while talking on the phone....never thought it would happen.</UTT>Yeah we have come a long way for sure. Unicef donated clean water when we don't use the phones</UTT>That is amazing! I need to check and see if Netflix has the spin off shows they have been coming out with lately, I want to see A Different World, and so many others.</UTT>Yeah there is a lot there to see really. Do you have an adnroid or an iphone?</UTT>I only use an Android. I tried the iPhone...not for me lol plus too expensive. I would rather have a better car than put too much money into phones and save the money lol</UTT>Yeah me too. Nice chatting with you :)
t_54f1838a-d63f-400c-9725-de12e32fe8d2</CONV>do you know much about planets?</UTT>I do. Did you know JUpiter has a moon that if orbited the sun would be a planet?</UTT>yes that would be Ganymede, pretty cool</UTT>Yeah=. Did you know that Venus does not tilt?</UTT>Yes and that is why it does now have any seasons</UTT>Yeah and also it is the only one that rotates clockwise</UTT>Yeah. There is another planet where it rains shards of glass</UTT>Yeah and that is at speeds of 4500 mph in 2000 degrees fahrenheit</UTT>Yeah Did you know they have found building blocks of life in another planet?</UTT>ye and that is really far from here, some 455 light years away</UTT>Yeah. Did you know Uranus rotates sideways?</UTT>yes and it rolls instead or rotating around the sun</UTT>Yeah.  Do you like reading?</UTT>I love it a lot actually, and you?</UTT>Me too. Did you read starship troopers?</UTT>Yes and it is good. it is also recommended by military branches</UTT>Yeah same with Ender's game, military loves that too</UTT>Right. Do you know who holds the record of speed reading?</UTT>That would be Anne Jones at 4700 words per minute</UTT>Yeah. Did you know in the 18th century there was moral panic because people were reading novels?</UTT>Yes and now we have the opposite panic, for the opposite reason</UTT>Yeah sadly. Do you know who Tolkien and CS Lewis were?
t_cdef48ec-1a7a-4013-b0e5-6e77278ecbac</CONV>Hello, are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>I am, to a certain degree, yes. You? It's all been kind of driving me nuts lately, but somehow I have been able to survive.</UTT>I try to find humor in it! I take joy in the fact that Trump isn't one of the three wealthiest presidents of all time for example.</UTT>What! That's insane! How is that possible? I thought he was good at was being super duper filthy rich. !!</UTT>I'm sure they measure for inflation! Anyways I think other presidents seem to have priorities other than politics too, like the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Now that is hilarious for sure! Trump should do the same, maybe he can make more money and rank top 3 riches presidents finally! Do you use FaceBook at all?</UTT>Ahah I'm sure people would rather him never sing. And I do! Why do you ask?</UTT>I was just reading about Facebook. Interesting that Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook. I'm sure they regret that. But who can know what websites are going to become huge or flop! I don't use facebook, likely due to lack of friends. lol</UTT>Oh that is interesting! And now look how far they've come. It's interesting how other companies do the opposite, and instead of engaging with Facebook they go against them. I remember Burger King had a promotion where you got a free Whopper by unfriending 10 people.</UTT>Haha what is up with that! Burger Kind has an agenda! Yeah, interested to see how Facebook ends up. There was a time I never thought I'd see the end of Myspace!</UTT>I wonder if we'll ever see the end of Facebook, a lot of places don't see it too favorably. For some reason, Facebook's like button is illegal in a part of Germany.</UTT>Oh wow! Maybe that's why they added other options... At least I noticed my brother doing a smiley face instead of a like, I believe. I just found out that Mark Zuckerberg made facebook blue, because he suffers from red-green blindness! crazy!</UTT>I didn't know that's why Facebook is blue! I'm sure other colorblind folk appreciate it too haha. And that's true Facebook is becoming even bigger in other areas, I heard Iceland is actually rewriting their constitution and using Facebook to get the public to make suggestions.</UTT>Oh wow! I wouldn't like having to join just to make suggestions. But I'm sure they have other means of getting suggestions. At least I hope so. Actually I appreciate the blue as well. Not that I use facebook, I just appreciate blue! :) Time flies! Facebook was created in 2004!</UTT>Wow time really does fly, I guess Facebook came right before YouTube in 2005 then, they're both so old now. Are you a big fan of YouTube too?</UTT>Oh I love youtube! What a great website! You can learn so much there, or create videos to teach others and maybe earn some ad revenue at the same time! Truly a great website!</UTT>I think it's very useful too! Especially with the things it inspires, like there's a YouTube-esque site for police called "Blutube", for sharing law enforcement videos.</UTT>Oh I've heard about blutube! I've been meaning to check it out! Youtube is huge! I mean, wow, the second largest search engine! Easy to believe since I'm always watching youtube!</UTT>Yeah it's crazy how much the biggest sites leave their mark on the Internet. I think Netflix and Youtube combines make up half of peak Internet traffic in North America.</UTT>Two of my most favorite websites! Sometimes I use both websites at the same time! Fun fact! Justin Beibers "baby" song is the most disliked video on youtube!</UTT>See, for all the positivity YouTube inspires there's still a lot of hate on it, guess you have to see the best of both sides. Anyways it was very nice chatting with you tonight, have a great night!</UTT>I agree! People can be pretty mean sometimes! And Ditto! It was wonderful chatting with you as well!</UTT>Absolutely haha, take care!
t_a982b81c-c00e-476e-9820-a0c184b16f5d</CONV>Hello, do you travel much?</UTT>Yes, I like to travel, I planned to take a month vacation in Las Vegas, NV in march, do you?</UTT>Oh that sounds like fun. Yes I try to as much as I can. Have you ever visited Japan?</UTT>Wow now, I have never visit Japan, what about you? I feel a little nervous thinking about a plane ride that far.</UTT>I actually have but did not know until now that had I travelled the country by car, I would have paid $300 in tolls.</UTT>Are you saying that one can get to Japan by car, wow, If yes how many hours is that and how many days it would take to get to Japan?</UTT>Well you can get the car across by a large ship, I was just referring to travelling with a car around the country. But yeah I wonder how long that would take to get a car shipped there</UTT>As you mention earlier $300 or more to travel across country. One day I hope to visit Japan, I will make sure I take lots of extra money with me.</UTT>Yup do that for sure. And if you go to Iceland make sure you rent a car there or just fly a lot</UTT>Did you know the dutch creating a commuter bus designed to travel 160 mph? I don't think I want to travel on a bus with that king of speed?</UTT>I actually want to try that. Do you know who the first king to travel the world was?</UTT>Yes If I am right, the first king name Kalakaua, I didn't know there are kings in hawaii, guess I never thought about it.</UTT>Yeah me either but so cool of him. How about tv, do you watch much?</UTT>Yes, when I am not working I watch TV in the livingroom and sometime when i am lying in bed. I try to watch news every night.</UTT>Oh cool. Do you ever watch shows like the Simpsons?</UTT>Yes, I have watch the Simpson and other shows like the Flintstones and Dad.</UTT>Nice. Did you know there is an episode where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned?</UTT>No I didn't know that. Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types and dogs donate blood to other dogs?</UTT>That is so cool. In Istanbul they have a vending machine where you put plastic bottles and then it dispenses food and water for the dogs,</UTT>Oh wow, I didn't know that. did you know dogs and elephants are the only two animals understand pointing?</UTT>Nice, that says a lot about how smart they are I am assuming. Nice chatting with you
t_49a355d3-6ac0-4e03-97af-c918df3b2e87</CONV>Hello,  how are you doing? Chinese american james wong howe was an oscar-winning cinematographer who pioneered the use of wide-angle lenses, low-key lighting, crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography. he was not an american citizen until 1943 and his marriage with a white woman was illegal until 1948 due to racism.</UTT>That's interesting. No woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography.</UTT>Even though spartacus had a cinematographer, stanley kubrick took the camera away from him and did it himself. even though he did almost none of the work, when spartacus got the academy award for best cinematography, it went to the credited cinematographer, and not kubrick.</UTT>Too funny! Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won.</UTT>Wow,  thats tough! Gavin free, known for rooster teeth and achievement hunter on youtube, also worked on the slow motion cinematography for hot fuzz, sherlock holmes: a game of shadows, and dredd</UTT>Cinematographer roger deakins has been nominated 13 times for the best cinematography oscar, and has never won.</UTT>yeah,  I think you just told me that.  Too bad for him.  which movies was he apart of?</UTT>I'm not sure. Are movies your favorite form of entertainment? Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.</UTT>Yes,  I watch a lot of movies!  When caesar visited britain, around 50bc, he noted that its people bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment</UTT>That's interesting. Bill nye "the science guy" got his break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest.</UTT>He really does look like Steve martin. The nintendo entertainment system was finally discontinued in september of 2003 in japan.</UTT>Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures.</UTT>Ronald reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment executive didn't think he had "that presidential look."</UTT>Haha. Guess he showed that exec! Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures</UTT>Thats interesting.</UTT>Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognizable and familiar..</UTT>Cool. The nintendo entertainment system could display only 54 colors.</UTT>I didn't know that! Early forms of entertainment were supported in royal courts.</UTT>nice!  Do you like animals? There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.</UTT>That's amazing. There are 1.5 million living species, but 1 million of them are insects!</UTT>nice talking to you.
t_50225050-a855-4f4f-bffa-e8a2733b8788</CONV>I am not a Facebook fan. How about you? Its amazing how big it has vgrown since it's origin in 2004.</UTT>I'm pretty indifferent to facebook even though I've been on it on and off since it was founded in like 2004</UTT>I am also not a fan of the founder, Zuckerberg. you?</UTT>No, I don't like his philosophy of removing anonymousy off the internet nor letting 13 year olds have a facebook profile</UTT>legal maneuvers, i suppose. Funny how you rarely hear about the other co-founders.</UTT>Yea his rommates Saverin, McCollum, Moskovitz, and Hughes; they made a movie about facebook that said there was disagreements and I've heard Zuckerburg at least screwed over one of them</UTT>And still people, like sheep, trust that they can share their personal info on the Facebook platform without concerns. Since the founders all started out as students at Harvard, I wonder how many graduated...</UTT>I don't know, but facebook is worth 104 billion now so I guess it doesn't matter too much</UTT>Right. :Sorry for not graduating Mo,. but here is a house for you." Today, Facebook makes most of it's money from advertisements, and screwiing with elections. LOL</UTT>Too bad myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook, I liked myspace a lot better when I was in high school</UTT>My dog had a MtSpace page. Maybe you were Myspace friends... Apparently my dog did not help them earn enough money to afford to write a check for $75 million..</UTT>Maybe, dogs do have constitutionally guaranteed legal rights in Germany</UTT>The German Shepherd dog lobby is strong in Germany. But this does not explain how the Loch Ness monster was granted status as s protected species. Although there are a lot of monsters in politics.</UTT>There's also a lot of insects in politics too, and 1 million species of them too</UTT>All polititians are animals. 20 quantrillion animal species on earth, and most of them live in my back yard.</UTT>I only really care about the domesticated ones so I guess if they don't have a white patch on their foreheads I don't care about them</UTT>I have a cat named, "Spot" because she has a white spot on her face, but she is far from domesticated. Must be another holdover from evolution, like hiccups.</UTT>I wonder why that's why people say to drink water when you have the hiccups, something to do with use to having gills</UTT>Right. Another evolutionary quandry...is the guitarist from the band, "Muse" who hols the record for smashing more guitars while on tour than anyone else.</UTT>Matthew Bellamy? That's a pretty cool world record to have</UTT>Sure. I wonder if Bellamy ever set speakers on fire like Eddie Van Halen did while recording a solo for "beat it"?</UTT>I don't know, the both of them should team up with Brain May and find something crazy to do with May's astrophysics knowledge</UTT>Where are all the normal guitarists these days? Maybe they are all held hostage on the floating recorning studio that Pink Floyd has on the river Thames...</UTT>Lol, maybe. Well it was nice chatting with you
t_0c024231-0d53-4c89-aa81-811abf030774</CONV>Well, that was weird. My articles just switched to basketball</UTT>Mine always were.  Did you see how judge Judy's pay compares to Lebron's</UTT>yes, but considering the size of here syndication area, it makes sense,</UTT>Yep.  Lebron certainly deserves his pay.</UTT>People who complain about their salaries don't take into account how many people can watch them and how much money the networks and teams make off of their talents.</UTT>Exactly! The multiplier is the thing.  I started a company selling directory assistance calls to AT&T at less than 25 cents apiece.  However, we sold over 50 million such calls per month.</UTT>My dad was a Yankee before I was born. I've never understood why this concept does not sink in with some people. These people deserve it- lebron james' high school basketball games would attract 1750 attendees. tickets cost between $100 - $120.</UTT>I agree.  The challenge in life is to find the enterprise that gives one the benefit from the "multiplier".  Jordan was smart enough to turn down $10 million for shoes and later received $90 million from another company.</UTT>Lebron James, and one reason he's so successful is that he understands this, his worth.</UTT>No doubt about it.  I suppose he may have an agent who helps with that strategy.  Did you notice that the US Supreme Court has a basketball court on the top floor known as "The Highest Court in the Land?"</UTT>That's funny. Like how The new zealand basketball team are nicknamed the "tall blacks"</UTT>I wonder what the derivation of that name really is.  Also, the dunk being banned for 10 years.  I think it took that long to figure out how to build a backboard that won't shatter.</UTT>It was a joke referring to their famous rugby team The All Blacks.</UTT>I see.  That is somewhat of a relief.  I agree with coaches of football or basketball being highly paid.  They bring in the revenue.</UTT>Yeah, I think anyone who contributes to a successful team should be paid very well.</UTT>It is back to that multiplier thing.  How much revenue does the sport bring in and how much less would it be with a bad coach?</UTT>And that's why bad coaches get fired very quickly.</UTT>Sure is.  It is simple economics.  Few of us work in jobs where our financial contribution is so visible.</UTT>Though this is a bad stat: In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.</UTT>I read that.  I think it is an okay stat.  The governor of a state does not impact the income like a coach does.  I am originally from Oklahoma and our college football has been pretty important for years.</UTT>Depends on the state, I'm from NJ but live now in NY. It isn't that important here.</UTT>I understand that.  Well, Panda is calling.  Nice talking with you.

How about you?</UTT>yeah me either, I like the rockies because they are close and fun to go see</UTT>Very cool. Do you know why managers wear uniforms?</UTT>yeah I saw that, crazy right? can you imagine them playing? too funny</UTT>Yes, I always thought it was odd that they wore uniforms. But now it makes sense that it it because they can play.</UTT>Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in canada? kickball was fun as a kid</UTT>I used to love kickball. It makes sense because it is a mixture of those sports but it is easier to keep it just one word.</UTT>yeah always fun! Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's status as America's national pastime?</UTT>I wonder why they are surprised that it is popular here. It is americas favorite past time.</UTT>yeah, they are crazy about baseball. heading there in May</UTT>That is very exciting. Maybe you will be able to watch a game. Do you know who schedules the games?</UTT>maybe I'll have to introduce them to kickball. No, who schedules the games? ;)</UTT>Up until 2005 it was a married couple for 24 years!</UTT>Now it's probably some lonely person</UTT>hahah probably. I wonder if that position is remote so you would not need to go into the office.</UTT>that's the only way you or I would do it. Ha! Who won the world series? I don't remember.</UTT>I am not sure who won the most recent world series.</UTT>The women's world cup had higher ratings than the US world series???</UTT>Yes, I did hear that. I was a little surprised.</UTT>pretty bad if you're a cubs fan, last time your team won the world series, the ottoman empire was still in existence.</UTT>That was so long ago! I am going to go try to find out who won the last world series. It was nice talking to you.
t_b1469f55-0ae0-4507-a541-5c0baa1a3e3d</CONV>Do you ever shop at Target?</UTT>I have shopped at Target. It seems like a nice store, nicer than Walmart, if you ask me.</UTT>I would agree. Did you know that they will price match Amazon?</UTT>I suppose these days they have to. Amazon is everywhere and any time! Target really needs to compete.</UTT>It's a good idea. Did you also know that there are no Target stores in Vermont?</UTT>I wonder what's special about Vermont. Is it the law or something? It's right next door to New Hampshire. Hm. Target doesn' carry tobacco, either.</UTT>That's a good question. I did not know that they didn't sell tobacco. I wonder how long that's been the case?</UTT>It's been at least 20 years, though I wonder what stopped sales. There is money in tobacco. Maybe they want to have a friendly, safe image.</UTT>I'm sure that's the reason. I had also heard that there is a state senator that has to also work at Target to make enough money.</UTT>I guess being a state senator really doesn't pay well. But why Target? Aren't there better jobs out there?</UTT>You would think so. Maybe the flexibility?</UTT>I guess. Seasonal work, flexible hours. Target stopped selling tobacco, but they sell herbal supplments. Talk about a bogus product.</UTT>Yeah I'm not a believer in holistic medicine myself. Off topic but do you watch a lot of TV. I watch a whole lot.</UTT>I sometimes watch the box when I'm in the gym. Try to catch up on the news and stuff.</UTT>Are you a fan of The Simpsons?</UTT>I enjoyed the first eight seasons. I don't find the recent stuff interesting. The show has run its course. You?</UTT>I haven't seen it in a long time but I used to watch it. Did you know that there is only one episode ever where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned?</UTT>The show really was about Bart and his hijinks. I think it's funny that That 70's Show was remade verbatim in the UK and flopped. Something about casting didn't work, I think.</UTT>Those things rarely do. The only one I can think of that really did was The Office. Did you happen to see the Family Guy episode of South Park?</UTT>I did. It was the one when the manatees were fetching balls to make up a story line. Good episode.</UTT>It was hilarious. After that episode aired, The Simpsons crew sent flowers to the South Park office which is find very funny.
t_01100c05-2d86-49af-8340-36964d5e23c4</CONV>Hi Do you know much about cars?</UTT>I know a little bit about them. I know that I love driving and would rather not have to walk if I can help it! Do you?</UTT>Hahaha  I'm like you.  I was surprised to learn that the first patent was issued in 1886 to Karl Benz.</UTT>Really? That is surprising to hear! In 2014 it was estimated that the number of cars was over 1.25 Billion! I wonder how many more there are now!</UTT>Holy smokes!  That's a lot of plastic and metal.  I wonder if Karl Benz ever wondered there would be that many cars when he was developing them.</UTT>Yeah! I bet he never imagined we'd have that many cars! It's a shocking number, for sure! Did you know it's legal in South Africa to have a flame thrower on your car?</UTT>I didn't know that.  Yikes!  What do they do with them?</UTT>Ha! I'm assuming use them for road rage situations. But they say, they use them to prevent carjackings.</UTT>That sounds scary to live there if they have to put those on their cars to prevent that.  The first car that was made available to the masses was the Model T built by Ford in 1908.  I've seen those in parades.</UTT>Model T Ford, just sounds cool! I'm sure I've likely seen one before. Jann Mardenborough became a pro race car driver by beating 90,000 people in the video game gran turismo! I used to love that game!</UTT>That is interesting.  I wonder if that was part of a contest or something?  I didn't realize McDonalds didn't have drive thrus until 1975.</UTT>Yeah! I heard they added the drive-thrus then so that soldiers in fatigues didn't have to get out of their cars, since they weren't allowed to.</UTT>Yes!  Do you know how the backs of cars became to be known as trunks?</UTT>Nope. I never thought about it. Do you?</UTT>They are called that because in the early days of cars people used to carry wooden trunks on the back of them.</UTT>That hardly sounds very safe for ones belongings! But hey, if that's all they could do back then, I get it! Do you have a dog?</UTT>I do have a dog!  Did you know that they are not color blind?</UTT>No I didn't! I always thought they were! So they see color?</UTT>They just can't see as many different colors as humans.  I have to get ready to wrap things up for the evening.  I enjoyed the chat!</UTT>Oh wow! Interesting! Yeah, I have to get going too. Have a great night! :)</UTT>You have a great night too!

I would like to watch with the kids Mary and the Witch's Flower.</UTT>Nice. did you know people fantasy draft the national spelling bee?</UTT>I could see that, sounds like you won't get much money for that though. Rather be a paid actor at that point.</UTT>true. did you know there is also fantasy congress?</UTT>That itself sounds very boring I'd rather shoot myself than to do that.</UTT>I guess there are people who enjoy it. Did you know there is a single fold in the brain that makes the difference about fantasy and reality?</UTT>yes, i've looked this up after watching the matrix. It's very interesting.</UTT>So amazing. have you ever watched The House?</UTT>No. I'd rather read the 15,145 page fantasy manuscript written by a janitor from chicago.</UTT>That is amazing how he did that</UTT>Well it took him 6 years to write it. I don't even know how if I could dedicate such time to do it.</UTT>Exactly. do you know michael cane?</UTT>I do not know a michael cane. I know a michael caine, a michael scott.</UTT>yeah, caine . He apparently became an actor because all the pretty girls were in drama class.</UTT>I do not understand.</UTT>DO you know Jon Hamm?</UTT>Not sure who that guy is. I know the famous people like Spielberg.</UTT>He is an actor and used to be a drama teacher. Do you know Ellie Kemper?</UTT>Yes, I love Ellie Kemper. She is beautiful.</UTT>She is really funny. Nice chat.

It isn't a cadillac is it?</UTT>No, it is not.  I heard that Cadillac was named after a French explorer who founded Detroit.</UTT>Yep that is right, his name was antonie de la mothe cadillac. I am glad they just stuck with Cadillac lol</UTT>I know, right?  His entire name is so hard to pronounce.</UTT>For sure, doesn't quite roll off the tongue very good. Did you know in south africa you can equip your car with flamethrowers?</UTT>Yes, I know.  It is illegal in the US.</UTT>For sure, and very dangerous I bet. I need a flame thrower to warm my car up in this cold weather</UTT>Where are you located?  East part of the US?  It's warm in Texas.  Do you know why McDonalds' added the first drive through?</UTT>Iowa, so cold here! Did they add it to make it easy to obtain food lazily? lol</UTT>You are funny.  It was in order to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their uniform.</UTT>that is some nice respect. That probably helped profits around military bases.</UTT>Most businesses think of themselves before thinking of their customers.  I'm sure McDonalds just wanted to be more profitable.</UTT>yea very good point, lol! Did you knw why they call it a trunk</UTT>Because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back.</UTT>there you go, pretty easy lol! I wonder how easy it was to steal from someones trunk in the early days</UTT>It should be really easy.   Did you hear about someone who became  a professional race car driver because he beat 90000 people in the video game Gran Turismo?</UTT>I used to love playing that game. I couldn't imagine playing anyone 90000 times, but it paid off in the end for that guy. What was his name?</UTT>Jann Mardenborough.  Have you heard this name before?</UTT>I have never heard that name. I am going to google him. It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>It was nice chatting with you too.
t_6b7b52b0-b4db-44b3-91b0-d414da6bf57d</CONV>When I was a kid I used to always collect baseball cards. I heard a man found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic. Have you ever collected baseball cards?</UTT>That's cool.  Sadly, bo I never collected baseball cards.  What about you?</UTT>I love baseball so yes, but none are worth any crazy money. Do you watch baseball at all?</UTT>Yes, I do watch some games.  I read somewhere that managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams, if the need arises.  How wild is that?</UTT>Yeah baseball does have some weird rules. I think its because the sport is so old. My dads favorite team is the cups and they started in 1876! They also had one of the longest droughts ever, 108 years. What is your favorite team?</UTT>My favorite team is the Atlanta Braves and they have been around as long as the Cubs, too.  Both were founded the same year as the Little Bighorn battle.  Wow!</UTT>Both those teams have so much fans. My dad said when the Cubs won in 2016 over 5 million people celebrated in the streets. Have you heard of the cubs curse?</UTT>Yeah, it's pretty funny actually. It started in 1945 when stadium security wouldn't let a man named Billy Sianis stay in the stadium with his smelly pet goat.</UTT>The best part about baseball is watching the world series. I remember when the red sox came back and beat the Yankees down 0-3. Its crazy how its been going on since 1903. I wonder how many people actually watch it still.</UTT>I think it's still pretty popular.  You know in Japan is so popular, many fans are surprised to discover its status as America's national pastime.</UTT>I dunno because my friend told me that the women's world cup had higher television ratings than the world series.</UTT>Worldwide I think Soccer rules.  But, baseball is still pretty popular, too.  I read somewhere that kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada.  That's kind of strange.</UTT>Speaking of strange I heard that the cubs have employed a pitcher with 6 fingers. I do not know why my dad likes that team</UTT>Yeah, they have had pitchers with 4,5, and 6 fingers on their pitching hand. Uncommon, but totally true!</UTT>Another weird thing about the cubs is the last time they won the ottoman empire was still going. Do you really think they were cursed?</UTT>I don't know about cursed, probably just bad luck on their part.</UTT>They started out so good, they were the first team to win back to back. seems kinda weird maybe baseball is fixed.</UTT>I've said that before, myself!  Did you know the great Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 World Series with his team down by one run?</UTT>People do not care even if it is fixed, they still wanna watch it. in 2005 a couple scheduled 2430 games!</UTT>Yeah, I heard that they did that for 24 years.  They must be very organized to keep all those schedules straight.</UTT>Baseball is a fun sport, I like seeing it in person live. Have you ever seen baseball in person?</UTT>Yes, I have seen many baseball games in my lifetime.  I still love it just as much as I did when I was a kid, playing.  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, I need to get to work.  I'll talk to you later, friend.
t_c07f54d1-bbb2-422f-8bc2-b93d628bcea7</CONV>Have you heard about the hs teacher in FL who had students help him drown raccoons in class?</UTT>Yes.  That must have been traumatic for the kids and against the law too.</UTT>Traumatic, I'm sure, for the student who shot a video broadcast on an Orlando TV station. The teacher was a long-time, 34 year veteran teacher in Ocala, FL.</UTT>I can understand that the raccoons were a problem.  They were killing chickens.  But he obviously had trapped them.  He should have taken them to the woods many miles away.</UTT>Exactly. That's what we'd do in my rural area of the northeast. Most people understand that raccoons can be pests.</UTT>Apparently the law would have allowed humane euthanasia, but I don't know that methods are considered humane.</UTT>It's certainly humane to relocate animals if possible. Can't you just imagine the range of comments this event brought out on Facebook?</UTT>I am sure it went viral.  You know the color scheme on Facebook is largely blue because its founder is red-green colorblind.</UTT>Shame Zuckerberg can't see green because he has a LOT of "green" most of us will never see.</UTT>True.  But we won't have to testify before Congress either. Facebook sure had humble beginnings with its start in a few colleges.</UTT>Absolutely. Launched in 2004. Over 1 million registered users by, I believe, 2006 or 2007. Public offering in 2012. That's fast growth.</UTT>I love it that Americans continue to create such value like that and Google and Amazon.  Last year Facebook had 2.2 billion users who are active.</UTT>I didn't know that. I'm beginning to become wary of these new "giants" of the information age. Facebook has surged eons ahead of the book of faces in collegiate directories, hasn't it?</UTT>Yes.  Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million.  Blockbuster also turned down an offer to buy Netflix for $50 million.  Both of the potential buyers are now gone or nearly gone.</UTT>I'll be somebody out there is rueful today about their decision in 2005 (MySpace) not to purchase Facebook.</UTT>Undoubtedly.  I wish I could relive 2008 over and get my money out of the stock market before it crashed.  I read that the "like" button is illegal in one German state.</UTT>Sorry about your financial loss. Impossible to "like" in any way. Maybe the German restrictions make some sense.</UTT>I just said it to demonstrate that there are many people with financial regrets. Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish with a neck?</UTT>Funky. The only fish I know well are trout, bass and catfish, all considered olfactores, I believe. (No limbs with digits).</UTT>Those are all fresh water fish, which means that they "drink" water through their skins rather than their mouths.</UTT>Yes. I've never done ocean fishing, but I'd love to catch a small shark and prepare a meal with it right on deck. Saltwater fish like sharks drink, too, through gills and their mouths. Wanna put a tasty shark in my mouth. I've been told they're delicious.</UTT>My problem with deep sea fishing is I like to be in control.  When I want to go to shore, I want to go now.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is supposed to be immortal.  I guess whoever said that does not know the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy is increasing.  That means that all particles in the universe will someday be moving in a random way.  No jellyfish then.</UTT>As far as I can see, a lot of things in my universe are moving randomly already. In the election of 2020, I hope that course can be corrected! Good to speak with you. Thanks.</UTT>Likewise.  Bye.
t_d4039df1-76f2-4741-b184-584c13420000</CONV>hi!</UTT>Hi, can you imagine the US not charging income tax like Monaco!</UTT>no that's crazy! Did you know 86% of Nevada is owned by the government, crazy!</UTT>No, i didnt! Why do they own so much?</UTT>I think it's a power trip, not sure! You know the government does what it wants lol</UTT>I would agree with you! Do you think the US is a strict as China? They censor the word "censorship".</UTT>Oh wow, I do not think the US is as strict as China</UTT>My brother was in China teaching English and even the internet is locked down there. I kinda this its odd that we publish peoples name who renounce their citizenship.</UTT>I agree! China is very strict from everything I have read. Was your brother happy in China? I think the government goes too far most of the time in some countries.</UTT>He enjoyed China! He missed a lot of the thing back here in the US though. Are you a Hanson fan?</UTT>I bet he missed a lot! I am not sure are you talking about Hanson the singers? I hear them on the radio once in awhile.</UTT>Yes, exactly! They are actually from a town near where i lived in Oklahoma. Can you believe that they had a song that was the most requested on a Alt/Rock station?</UTT>Wow, I was not aware of that. They were pretty popular for awhile! Did you know in Canada all radios must play 40% canadian music??? Wow.</UTT>Haha, i didnt know that. Come to think of it i dont really even know that many Canadian bands.</UTT>I don't either! lol, some of the Governments want to rule everything i think. There was a man who acted as a government official and sold the eiffel tower! 2 times!</UTT>Maybe the government isn't doing to well if they've had to be bailed out by JP Morgan.</UTT>Right?? Our world is so mixed up, hopefully one day our Government and politicians will make sense for a change.</UTT>Are you affected by the government shut-down? I cant believe they've shut down 17 times.</UTT>I am not thankfully! But I know many who are and I think the Government needs to be the ones to not get paid until they sort everything out!</UTT>I did hear that many are still collecting salaries while not working. Thats not good.</UTT>They are? I think I heard that but it will be delayed in getting paid. Only the people actually working should still be paid as usual it's not right how the system works.</UTT>have a great day!
t_ee4c7380-d721-48d1-814d-00cd4dd35c8e</CONV>I don't like Kin Jong Un or his sister</UTT>I don't know much about them.</UTT>Yes when we have a reality TV star as president many people look for cult of celebrity in politics</UTT>I heard that he had his own defense minister killed.</UTT>Yes he has killed many people.  He tortured witnesses and his own family members</UTT>I've heard that about him. I don't even think they have the internet in North Korea.</UTT>The regular people do not but the king does.  He has a lot of things while his people are starving</UTT>Apparently Kim Jong Un cuts his own hair too.</UTT>He is unlike most celebrities with money and fame for sure.</UTT>He also apparently orders the repairs of theme parks himself.</UTT>I did not know anything about North Korea having theme parks.  Many celebrities in the US make lots of money - even minor ones like Judge Judy.</UTT>I believe that she makes a lot of money, she is on TV every single day. It is hilarious.</UTT>Yes.  I love that Ethiopia has a celebrity chef who believes he can combat hunger by encouraging diverse eating</UTT>That is very interesting, I've never heard of Jenna Marble the youtube celebrity, but apparently she makes $346,827 from it.</UTT>Wow.  I knew youtube can pay some people a lot for ads!</UTT>They do, you have to wonder how long something like that will be able to last though.</UTT>But some are even teenagers making much more than working at McDonalds!</UTT>This is true, I wonder if people in North Korea could earn a living off of Youtube.</UTT>I don't think the people in North Korea have access to the Internet</UTT>I do not think they do either, apparently not good barbers either!</UTT>Yes North Korea is an awful dictatorship run by the Kim family for years.
t_78012580-61cd-43eb-8f66-8426f03386d7</CONV>Hello! Do you like watching movies?</UTT>yes, i love watching movies. you?</UTT>I do too! What is your favorite genre?</UTT>i like all genres but usually drama, thriller and comedy are my faves.</UTT>Oh cool! I wish I took Jon Hamm's drama class in high school, I'd be somewhere today!</UTT>i wish i had taken drama from a famous teacher too. i might have ended up on the tv or something. doing a movie with TC</UTT>I would have rather worked with Hugh Laurie! He made bank!</UTT>yes, i bet he got paid more than the rest of the cast combined. but he got more talent than the rest of the cast combined.</UTT>He still isn't worth as much as Tom Cruise though! Or even Seinfeld!</UTT>nobody is worth seinfeld. the man is so rich he should start his own country. what does he do all day anyway? count his money?</UTT>He really is! I bet it's a full time job! Did you know TC built an underground bunker?</UTT>yeah, that sounds like scientology. i figure he is anticipating the alien invasion. can he speak alien? does he know the UN ambassador?</UTT>He's crazy! He even threatened a guy with the name Tom Kruse!</UTT>yes, he is very protective of his identity. i guess he thought that he had to defend his name. he is a street guy that way.</UTT>I guess he is! Full of drama though haha. Jim Carrey isn't though and avoids making dramas!</UTT>i think that he is wrong on that score. drama can be uplifting and positive. i reckon he could do quite well dramatically.</UTT>I think so too, besides the number 23. Have you ever listened to any radio dramas?</UTT>i did when i was younger. they can be quite exciting and dramatic. i can see why the kids loved them.</UTT>I will have to listen to them since I can find them free online!</UTT>You should! Lemont Cranston as The Shadow! Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Great chat to you as well. Have a good night!
t_b9652464-06aa-4f00-85a9-21dd9f673697</CONV>Hello - how are you doing today?</UTT>Hello. I am doing good and yourself?  Do you have an iphone by chance?</UTT>I'm doing good too. I do have an iPhone. What about you?</UTT>i don't, i have an android but i've heard that iphones have more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent.</UTT>I've heard that too which is kind of scary stuff.</UTT>It really is.  Phones are wonderful inventions though.  Just think about it. They convert sound into electrical signals.</UTT>I can't imagine not having a phone. New York's area code is 212 because this was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.</UTT>Is that right?  I wonder what the rest of the country thought about that when area codes were decided.</UTT>Not too sure. The cables carrying phone and data lines across the ocean are only 2.7 inches thick and just lay on the ocean floor.</UTT>That's incredible that all of that information travels in lines so small!</UTT>I agree! It's impossible to separate two phonebooks that have their pages overlapped together.</UTT>You know, I've actually heard that before. I guess it would have to be too very thick phone books for that to be.</UTT>I saw that Unicef will donate a day of clean water to child in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone.</UTT>That's a great program! I'd like to find out more about it. Do you know how to sign up or anything like that?</UTT>I do not. Do you like the movie Jumanji?</UTT>i like the original with Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt.  It was good!</UTT>I do too! The boy from Jumanji was the voice of chip in Beauty and the Beast.</UTT>I didn't know that.  That's cool.  Oh, hey, I do know that Bradley Pierce did the original voice of miles on sonic the hedgehog.</UTT>I didn't know that. Jumanji had an opening weekend in the US of $36 million.</UTT>That's pretty good for something that started out as a children's book in 1981!</UTT>I think so too. Tim Curry is the voice of slick in the Jumanji cartoon.</UTT>I like him.  The movie is taken from a book by Chris Van Allsburg and he also wrote the movie so I bet that's why it's so good.
t_689c3340-0078-496e-a7ea-1a3c87b5427f</CONV>Hello, are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>I am indeed! My favorite politician is Hillary Clinton.</UTT>I like her too! She definitely was raised to be a politician, she was even president of Young Republicans in college.</UTT>I find that interesting, but unsurprising. She's so accomplished. I guess she even has a grammy for the spoken word album of her book.</UTT>Yeah I would've never thought of her being famous that way! I saw a White House lecture online with Stephen Hawking that also had the Clintons featured.</UTT>How interesting. That's how you know you've made it...when you're associated with Stephen Hawking! I was so very excited to find out that she was the Democratic Party's nominee for President in 2016.</UTT>Oh yeah, she definitely was raised to be excellent with campaigns. Although I always thought it was strange the way she pandered to her audience, like when campaigning in the South she'd put on a Southern accent.</UTT>I think she's smart...there's probably a reason why she did that. I definitely think she could have handled the job of the President.</UTT>I think she could have too. The only thing I hold against her is she can be awkward with foreign relations and things get lost in translation. Like her and Sergey Lavrov pressed a "reset" button but it was incorrectly translated to be "overload" haha.</UTT>I understand your point. Being the president is such an important role. I wish we could have added her to the list of U.S. presidents.</UTT>And I think she'd be good at business too! I wonder how much she's worth, maybe she coud be one of the wealthiest presidents of all time.</UTT>Actually, the top three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. I wonder how she'd stack up.</UTT>Wow that's surprising! You would have thought Trump would be there somewhere. The U.S. presidential guest house is bigger than the White House.</UTT>You know, if this were 1805, Clinton would be the vice president! I guess in before the 19th century, the runner up of the election would become the vice president.</UTT>It's definitely a good thing that's changed since then! Now we seem to be more professional with the system. At least compared to other countries, like in Indonesia the president has released 3 albums while in office.</UTT>Hmm, I wonder if his songs were ever on the radio!</UTT>I'm not sure! I bet if they were we could have tuned in, am radios are able to pick up anything, even radio storms from Jupiter!</UTT>Radio is definitely such an underrated form of media. It's so simple, but so very effective. It's so simple that some soldiers in WWII made radios using razorblades and pencils.</UTT>That's incredible</UTT>I would agree wholeheartedly. There's also a website where you can listen to radio dramas for free, if you're interested.</UTT>That really does sound interesting! I have a preference for learning over the radio. I like one station a lot, it broadcasts a weekly news program entirely in classical latin!</UTT>I love classical latin! I bet Canada doesn't though...I guess in Canada, 40% of the content played on the radio needs to be Canadian. I bet they're not listening to latin!</UTT>Oh yeah that's a strange law, you'd think radio would be more free huh! Well it was nice talking to you, have a nice night!
t_7ef31cc0-05ed-4366-b3c1-f6ddeb0bc29c</CONV>Hey there what do you think about the president? And who do you think the top three most wealthy presidents were?</UTT>I think the President is probably in the top 3 richest presidents along with Kennedy and maybe Bush. Am I right?</UTT>Well it's actually JFK, Washington, and also Jefferson. I wouldn't have predicted that, but I guess it makes sense if your accounting for inflation, have you heard about the president of Zimbabwe yet?</UTT>I do not know about the President of Zimbabwe. I do know in Guatemala close relative of former Presidents cannot run for President</UTT>Well the president of Zimbabwe, his name is actually president banana haha. I wonder if he has a vice president named plantain LOL, and also the president of Indonesia released three pop albums, I kind of want to listen to those haha</UTT>Wow! Presidents around the world are very interesting! Did you know that only one of our Presidents had a PhD, Woodrow Wilson.</UTT>No I didn't know that! We should have more presidents with phds, did you know that before 1905, the runner-up would become the vice president, so you would have had President Trump and Vice President Clinton today?</UTT>I did know that! It must have been hard to work with your opponent, perhaps even harder than losing the election while having the popular vote. That happened to 5 candidates for president.</UTT>Yeah that would be hard. I wonder if that would be more or less hard and making three pop albums while in office like the president of Indonesia did?</UTT>Seems difficult to me. Also hard is learning another language, that last president to speak a foreign language was FDR.</UTT>That is interesting. Also I think it's weird that Nevada has a"none of these candidates"option when they vote, I think that could be used in other states as well, it would be useful</UTT>Wow, I wonder if we would ever have a President then or an inauguration. Lincoln was the first president to be photographer for his inauguration....with John Wilkes Booth in the photo!</UTT>Well that's very scary! Definitely a bad Omen, did you know that our top voter participation percentage has maxed out at about 63%, that seems really low to me, and that's over the last 100 years</UTT>I'd believe it, especially that a cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia Senate election. I'm not sure people take voting seriously.</UTT>No I don't think so. Especially since the taller candidate wins about 75% of the time, that's highly unlikely to be due to ideas, and instead is probably a factor of television showing the height difference</UTT>Well, he may not be tall but a dog beat two people for mayor. He served for 13 years.</UTT>Haha that's funny. I wonder what his daily routine consisted of? Speaking of Elections, did you hear that ancient Athens used to just use a lottery system? I could see how that would elect a dog LOL</UTT>In Oregon all elections are conducted by mail. I am so surprised at how different elections can be across the world!</UTT>That is interesting! do you go to any concerts by the way? They should have presidential election concerts haha</UTT>That would be great. Thanks for chatting. I learned a lot of cool new things!</UTT>I did too, and I'm going to make sure to avoid a free concert lol they were sued for having really bad concerts actually
t_b945a184-05ec-4ff3-a022-d763bd68d137</CONV>Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?</UTT>No but I figure since he was so good in martial arts moves, dancing would come easy.  What is more surprising is Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.</UTT>Lee won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship in 1958.</UTT>Well another actress who won dancing was Emilia Clarke.  She did the funky chicken dance and robot dance during her audition to Game of Thrones.</UTT>It doesn't seem that that would help her get the part.  Tupac danced ballet in high school.</UTT>Really!  I always thought he was softy in the inside.  Speaking of ballet, there are slippers that made drawings from the dancer's movements.</UTT>That would look like modern art to me.  Tupac obtained the role of Mouse King in a production of Nutcracker, so he was serious about it.</UTT>Another dance who took his job seriously was tap dancer Bill Bailey he was the first to do the moon walk ever recorded.  This whole time I thought Michael Jackson was the first.</UTT>I did not know that.  Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, so I must have lost my sense of rhythm between 1 and 5 years old.</UTT>Well Richard Nixon had a great sense of rhythm, he wrote a piano concerto and performed it live on the Tonight Show.</UTT>That is incredible!  Ballet dancers can wear out 4 pairs of dancing shoes per week.  Looks like that could find a more durable material.</UTT>Dance is such a beautiful art even parrots are getting into the action.  Parrots are able to dance perfectly in time with music.</UTT>My daughter used to have an African Grey.  I have seen the bird do it.  My wife plays the piano which is a stringed instrument but because of the hammers can be a percussion instrument setting the beat for the parrot.</UTT>Do you think parrots can dance to the sound of a piano?  It crazy to think that steam piano's used to exist and I hear they are very loud.</UTT>They can move with the beat. There is a gorgeous pianist named Lola Anastanove or something like that that I saw on Youtube.  Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody as Paul McCartney used for Hey Jude.</UTT>Interesting fact!  I saw a Youtube video about a mute man who was found wandering the streets in England and the only way he could communicate was via piano.</UTT>In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of Britain's highest mountain and found a piano.</UTT>How in the world could a piano have been placed there?  Fun piano fact.  Mozart and Haydn two of the biggest composers of the classical era each owned a piano made from the same tree.</UTT>That is a fun fact.  I would guess a helicopter on the piano placement.  They needed a light grand piano on the Hindenburg, so they made one of aluminum and it weighed 356 pounds.</UTT>All these fun piano facts and to think Italy was the county that invented the piano.</UTT>We have a 7 ft 6 inch grand in our house.  It is a great instrument.  Don't forget to look up Lola, the greatest female pianist of the day.. Nice talking with you.

Good investment, they have #1 and #2 popular search engines</UTT>Wow, that's incredible. I like Facebook as well,  it started a year before YouTube in 2004.</UTT>wow, how time as flown! I like facebook most of the time. Can you believe myspace turned down buying it?</UTT>They must be kicking themselves. That's a 104 billion dollar company!</UTT>Right and it would have only costed 50 million. They should have bought it anyways since it was the competition!</UTT>True, I have been on  Facebook so long I remember when it was expanded to people in higher education institutions.</UTT>I started in like 2006 I think, it was so cool to start. I didn't like the blue look though</UTT>Oh, that's only because the founder  suffers from red-green color blindness.</UTT>well that makes sense lol. I wonder why no other colors were put into it though. Oh well, what am i to say, it is worth the 104 billion</UTT>They get money from advertisers. Once, Burger King had a promotion to unfriend people for a whopper. LOL.</UTT>I loved that promotion, did you take part of that?</UTT>No, but if I was hungry enough I would have. LOL.  I do use the like button on Facebook, but did you know it's illegal in a German state?</UTT>Me too, I should've did it, I have 100s of friends I could have deleted lol. I wonder why it is illegal, thoughts?</UTT>I am unsure.  I know in Iceland they use it for suggestions about their constitution.</UTT>That is awesome, power to the people!

His sister is Cheryl and she is a basketball player</UTT>Ohh I see, its common for pro players to have family play like seth curry and mychel thompson brothers of steph curry played in the back court together</UTT>Exactly.  btw, did you know that Allen Iverson had a lifetime contract with Reebook, and he will get 32 million dollars by the time he turn 55 years old</UTT>omg they get paid too much, can he get paid in a lump sum?</UTT>That is a lump sum.  Such a lucky guy.</UTT>wow that's definitely lucky, but hey, i couldn't shoot a ball the way they do in that 9.4 inches diameter court so I guess they deserve it because they got talent.</UTT>they are the best in the world.  So they deserve the money.  Also, do you know Kareem abdul-jabbar</UTT>Well its mastery and training, well you know whats strange, the guy who invented busketball By the name James, is the only losing coach in the university of Kansas's History, its crazy lol. Not Particular, who is Abdul?</UTT>I really do not know how such a coach had a losing record.  Abdul is a very famous basketball player who used to play for Lakers, and he is very tall</UTT>OMG all players are tall, I think its a requirement for them to be good at the game.</UTT>Yeah, that is the nature of the game.  Some of them are not that tall, but these are exceptions.  Also, do you know Tim Duncan</UTT>ohh Yeah that's Fascinating, Yeah I know Tim Duncan of San Antonio spurs</UTT>He is my favorite player because of his talent on the course and his personality off the course.</UTT>Yeah He seems to have discipline, I read it somewhere that he stayed in college for 4 years instead of going directly to NBA.</UTT>Exactly.

Did you know in the early era of the planet, a day was much shorter!</UTT>That's a long long time! I did not know that either about shorter days. I saw that in 2010, the UN appointed an ambassador to extraterrestrials.</UTT>I wonder if extraterrestrials listen to radio storms from Jupiter?</UTT>I bet they do if they exist. Hard to believe you can hear them on Earth.</UTT>Maybe not Canada though, where all radios must play 40% Canadian music.</UTT>That is an odd law. Soldiers in WWII made radios using razorblades and pencils as the diode.</UTT>I wonder if one could build a guitar with crude tools like that.</UTT>I bet someone could come up with a way to do that.</UTT>It might not be able to set speakers on fire like Eddie Van Halen once did.</UTT>HAHA that's awesome! Pink Floyd's guitarist turned a houseboat on the river into a floating recording studio.</UTT>I wonder if smashing a guitar like Matthew Bellamy would sink such a location!</UTT>LOL. Brian May uses coins as a pick.</UTT>He is also a smart guy with a phd in astrophysics.</UTT>Wow - that's pretty amazing. I would have never guessed that.</UTT>I guess it might help.    Certainly more than classical latin, which is only useful if listening to a Finnish weekly news show!
t_1791567d-a15a-426d-b340-f7a27ff9fbcc</CONV>Hello, How are you tonight? Have you seen the Tesla car?</UTT>Yes I've actually driven in a Tesla before, what about you? I like that they have a lot of vehicles coming out like the model S and model X these days</UTT>Yeah, I heard they were coming out with new cars. Exciting!! What do you think of Elon Musk? I have watched him a few times in interviews.</UTT>Yeah he's very entertaining and interviews I think. It is crazy to me though that the Tesla Model S is so safe that somehow it broke the safety testing equipment, I don't know how that's possible LOL</UTT>Really, I agree, How does that happen? Saw where he took a  $78 million pay cut in 2014.</UTT>Yeah that is impressive. It's also impressive that Tesla releases their patents in order to encourage competition, I definitely would not do that if I owned the company haha</UTT>Most people wouldn't, wonder why? To help the environment? Who knows he probably got something else better lined up!</UTT>Yeah I agree. It's crazy though that they named themselves after Nikola Tesla, but they're not the only company that was named after him! There is another car company called just Nicola apparently</UTT>Interesting, I owned an electric car for 3 years, it was an easy car to drive. My husband named it the phantom! He could never here when I got home. lol</UTT>Haha well that is one benefit of the electric-car then! On a different note though, what do you think about Fox News? Apparently they broadcasting over 86 countries around the world</UTT>About the only one I watch these days! I didn't know Richard Nixon was one of the creators!</UTT>Yeah I didn't know that either! I also didn't know that they were going to sue The Simpsons because they kept parodying them, I thought that fox owns The Simpsons?</UTT>I did too! Didn't know they were going to create a cable channel  just for The Simpsons! Do you watch that show?</UTT>I liked to watch The Simpsons yes, back to fox news though it's interesting that their median viewer age is 68, that seems old</UTT>Yes, That's strange, find that hard to believe. I do believe Fox news is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.</UTT>Yes I think you're right. It's also interesting that Fox News has only 55% of its time dedicated to opinion pieces while on MSNBC at 85% of the time, they definitely have a better percentage on Fox News in my opinion</UTT>I think so.Do you like Dance? I love to watch babies dance to music, adorable!!</UTT>Yes I agree with you! I also think it's funny that the girl from Game of Thrones did the robot dance and also the Funky Chicken during her audition LOL I wish I could see that tape</UTT>Ha, ha, ha,I can imagine that! I'm not surprised MJ used a device for the lean dance move? Wasn't that in the song  Smooth Criminal?</UTT>Yes I think so. I'm also shocked that he has a patent on that device. It's crazy though that the moonwalk was first performed in1955 so it's actually an old dance move</UTT>Really, didn't know that? 1955, they had all kind of different moves then. Good chat!!</UTT>Thank you you too! And watch out next time you see a ballet dancer, apparently some ballet slippers can make drawings out of the performers movements on the floor
t_42964383-be17-4dc9-8b53-1f10cacb44c0</CONV>Hey have you ever gotten a hot chocolate at 7:11?</UTT>Not that I can remember.  I guess some lade in VA used it when approached by two carjackers.</UTT>Yeah she was 50 years old and use the piping hot liquid to fend them off LOL that's actually a good idea</UTT>The police report only noted that her 22-year-old daughter did it but the article isn't clear.  Still, I guess it worked.</UTT>Yep instead of guns people should carry around hot chocolate LOL but I guess the temperature of the hot chocolate was 170 degrees which is insane</UTT>Yeah, you don't hear of people dying with hot chocolate although it is 171 degrees.</UTT>Yep and 158 degree water will cause third-degree Burns, so they definitely got burns on the thieves</UTT>They had it comin'.  There's a guy in AL that used hot coffee for 2 robberies. It didn't say if he got caught.</UTT>Speaking of robberies, have you ever gotten to a car before? I guess the lady what's about to get into hers before she was accosted</UTT>Nope. Speaking of cars, in S. Africa it's legal to equip one's car with a flame-thrower to prevent such things.</UTT>Wow that's cool! Do that someone beat 90,000 people at the game Gran Turismo and then later became a professional race car driver, like how is that possible</UTT>Don't know... I do know that I'm happy McDonald's added drive thrus to help soldiers and it has help me as well.</UTT>Haha yes it is definitely helped me to be lazy, they didn't want the soldiers to have to get out of their cars in their uniform</UTT>Yeah.  It's sad the Pilgrims got a bum rap for boring clothes.  They were actually full of color.  They only wore black for special occasions.  I see Grateful Dead tie-dyed for them...</UTT>Haha that is sad, I wonder what the Apple clothing from the 80's looked like they actually had their own clothing line back then</UTT>I don't remember that.  They do still sell t-shirts.</UTT>I'll have to look those up, would you buy a t-shirt that was made in North Korea though? That's where Rip Curl shirts are made even though on the tag they say China</UTT>No, I'm not a fan of their crazy leader.  Did ya know that some ballet dancers go thru 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week?  Their poor feet...</UTT>Yeah that sounds like it would hurt. What do you think about putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes? Have you ever tried it apparently it makes the shoes smell better</UTT>Maybe the should try some shoes that are 5,000 years old.  They found some that perform better than modern shoes.</UTT>Yeah I want to see what those shoes look like. Do you know who Stephon Marbury is? apparently he is promoting some $15 shoes but is not being paid to do so
t_d40d9877-d775-4a83-9931-dc8d6d2e7c7c</CONV>Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !</UTT>Hi! Me too!</UTT>Hey do You know what Myspace is ? Did You ever had an account with them ? :)</UTT>I did have a MySpace acount! Kinda loved it! But then Facebook took over lol</UTT>Did You know Myspace turned down an offer to buy facebook for $75 million in early 2005 ?</UTT>Wow, I guess that was a huge loss! Facebook is so big now! Did you know Face book is mostly blue because Zuckerburg has some color blindness?</UTT>I knew he was color bling, but I didn't know that was the reason Facebook is blue :)</UTT>I thought that was pretty interesting! Burger King once had a promotion that if you unfriended 10 people....you would get a free whopper lol...crazy!</UTT>Did You ever unfriended anybody ? :)</UTT>no way lol, all of my Facebook friends are well known to me.</UTT>I did unfriend some - not a lot :) I wonder if they know that  they are "unfriended" ;)</UTT>I guess they might know if they see your posts or not.</UTT>Maybe they just think I'm not posting anything ;)</UTT>true! So do you like any Tv shows?</UTT>Plenty :) Now I'm watching Ray Donovan :) You ?</UTT>I like That 70's Show sometimes and love Grey's Anatomy.</UTT>I missed both :) are they good ?</UTT>Yes, very good. I like comedy and Drama. They cancelled That 70s Show in the UK lol guess they didn't get the humor.</UTT>...but was it the same show, or a remake with different crew ?</UTT>No That 70S show is just reruns but Grays Anatomy is an ongoing series.</UTT>But in UK - was it our version of that show, or did they make their own version ?</UTT>Ohhh, that I don't know, good question! I watch Southpark sometimes it's a funny cartoon.</UTT>I love the satire to current events in South Park :) same in Family Guy and Simpsons :)</UTT>Yes! Me too. So are you a fan of the newest phones at all?</UTT>Not really :) I like my 2 year old Android phone :)</UTT>I like my older Android as well. The prices are too high for me. It has been great chatting!!! Have a great night!! :)
t_ff375697-a66e-41a6-99c9-8664416f2e51</CONV>Do you remember about the confidential informant in the Trump campaign?</UTT>I had a vague recollection of that.  It was an FBI spy, right?</UTT>It was not an FBI spy - just someone in the campaign who was concerned about the connections between the Trump campaign and Russia.</UTT>oh ok, it was a confidential informant.  Trump claimed it was an FBI spy, but it wasn't.</UTT>Correct.  Even Lindsey Graham agreed  that he was not a spy.</UTT>Right, it seems the GOP did not want to back Trump on that whole spygate thing.</UTT>Yes it might have been the last time they stood up to Trump.  The president is a title for the head of state in most republics, but it is not a dictatorship</UTT>Right, although 5 have been elected while still losing the popular vote</UTT>Yes - the Republicans have lost the popular vote in 6 of the last 7 elections as their traditional demographic is shrinking.</UTT>That's true, they also don't seem very interested in reaching out beyond their traditional demographics.  I wonder how they plan to survive in the future?</UTT>I am not sure.  Their core support in recent years comes from the South and the Mountain states, and the Evangelicals.  The urban areas are all blue.</UTT>Hillary Clinton was a republican in college, apparently...that's interesting.</UTT>I did not know that.  Though she might be like me and grow more liberal as she ages.  Plus the Republican party has grown far more right-wing even since Reagan.</UTT>Yeah, the GOP is hard to relate to at times.  I try to be objective but its hard to even consider voting for a party that denies climate change and has people like Mike Pence that believe in conversion therapy.</UTT>I completely agree.  After the Civil Rights act and the Voting Rights Act they started shifting right and very conservative.  Taking away voting rights seems to be their big thing right now.</UTT>Yeah, they are not the party of Lincoln like they claim.  Although, Richard Nixon did propose a guaranteed minimum income.</UTT>Yes for sure.  I find it funny that Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride because he did not want to be associated with the Republicans!</UTT>That is really funny!  Lincoln was the first president to be photographed and john wilkes booth was in the photo...wow!</UTT>Wow that is crazy!   It fits though - every US president who has had a beard was a Republican!</UTT>Wow!  Trump should grow a beard.</UTT>I am not sure about an orange beard!  He might look like the first president of zimbabwe who was called president banana!
t_980ef011-8a49-40c6-b546-5171954180c6</CONV>Did you find the first part of this kinda hard to read?  I thought it was somewhat emotionally upsetting.</UTT>I concur.  Shooting at innocent children is the worst crime ever</UTT>Yeah I can't imagine what it would be like to be in that situation.</UTT>I turned off my TV set when I saw these incidents because I could bear to watch them</UTT>Yeah that's kinda how I am with the news on TV it always seems to be negative stuff like what's mentioned in this article.</UTT>By any chance, you watch a lot of TV</UTT>Yeah mostly Netflix not much public channels, do you watch TV much?</UTT>I used to but not now because I am quite busy.  By any chance do you know the 70's show was remade verbatim in the UK</UTT>No I did not know that did you know that star wars is the most successful film merchandising franchise</UTT>I knew they was a big success but not this success</UTT>yeah absolutely, have you ever played xbox?</UTT>Yes, I play it a lot in my free time, you?</UTT>yes absolutely what game do you like to play</UTT>football fantasy, auto thef and the likes.  YOu?</UTT>fortnite, overwatch and halo</UTT>Ohh, they are good games</UTT>yeah i like them a lot did you know the army use xbox 360 controllers to fly uav spy planes</UTT>Do you know that there are controllers created for quadrilpegics so that they are able to play xbox 360 and other consoles</UTT>no i did not that is pretty fascinating</UTT>did you know that the army use xbox 360 controller to fly uav spy plane</UTT>yes i did know that
t_93ccffb9-1d61-40b9-a866-f5cdb7b0b28e</CONV>Hey, ever use Facebook?</UTT>I do, it is the primary source of news for 30% of American adults. Do you use facebook your self?</UTT>COnstantly, unfortunately. I'd consider Burger King's offer to get a free WHopper by unfriending 10 people if I liked Burger King.</UTT>Yeah that would be cool, everyone uses facebook now, there are more people on Facebook than there were people in the world 200 years ago.</UTT>They've come a long way since 2004.</UTT>they did, it's because since 2006, anyone who claimed they are at least 13 years old could register.</UTT>I had heard that Iceland was rewriting their constitution using input from people on Facebook. I suppose that's a 21st century of doing it.</UTT>Probably, the sad thing is a third of all divorce filling of 2011 in the United States contained the word Facebook, so I could just imagine facebook ruining people's lives and children.</UTT>That is sad. Remember when all our immediate communication was over the telephone? I remember being excited as a kid to pick it up and see who was calling.</UTT>I do too, life was so simple in the 90's, I was so excited too when someone called, did you know that there is a luxury phone maker that hires the London symphony orchestra to record ringtones</UTT>Wow, that seems unnecessary. I wonder if they've done the Benny Hill theme song?</UTT>I'm not sure but that would be so funny</UTT>I heard once that if you interleave all the pages of two phonebooks that you can't pull them apart. I think Mythbusters confirmed it.</UTT>Wow that's crazy, did you know that dolphins will communicate with each other using a telephone, and they even recognize each other over the phone</UTT>That's awesome. I often wonder if they really are smarter than us.</UTT>I'm not sure, I think humans are the smartest creature.talking about intelligence, the inventor of dial telephone was convinced that telephone operators were rerouting his calls to rival businesses.</UTT>Sounds paranoid to me.</UTT>Yeah he must be, did you know that President Andrew Johnson never attended school in his life.</UTT>That explains his presidency. Speaking of historical people CS Lewis and Tolkien used to have a bad poetry contest.</UTT>really that sounds interesting</UTT>You laugh, you lose, was the criteria.</UTT>it's been nice talking to you.</UTT>likewise</UTT>bye
t_4b7f0380-2deb-43df-87d1-3b933762dba2</CONV>Hi there!  Do you like cars?  I do because I would never get to go anywhere without one.</UTT>It is very useful for getting me around.  I dont know what I would do without it.</UTT>lol  Did you hear about the flame throwing cars they have in South Africa?</UTT>Yeah, carjacking must be pretty bad there.</UTT>No doubt!  Did you know when and why McDonalds added drive thrus?</UTT>I heard it was because of the soldiers.</UTT>Yes.  They added them in 1975.  Did you know that the backs of cars became known as trunks because cars used to carry wooden trunks on them back in the old days?</UTT>That makes a lot of sense.  I heard in England it is called the boot.</UTT>That's interesting!  Do you know who the car brand Cadillac was named after?</UTT>Its a french explorer.  Antoine de la mothe Cadillac</UTT>You get a super chat high five!  I was surprised to see that the first patent for a car was given out in 1886.</UTT>Yeah, me too,  I always thought it was Ford who did all that, but he was the first to mass produce.</UTT>Ford made the Model T in 1908 I believe?</UTT>Yes!  That is correct!</UTT>Do you like reading?</UTT>I do.  I dont understand the moral panic of the 18th century though.</UTT>Me neither.  Reading was one of the few forms of entertainment people had back then.  Enders Game is suggested reading for many military organizations including the Marines!</UTT>Its a good book!  Have you read it?  I am not sure int is military reading material though,</UTT>I haven't read it.  I haven't read Starship Troopers either which is on the reading lists of 3 of the 5 US military branches.</UTT>I did read Enders Game, but not Starship Troopers.  If the military recommends maybe it is good.</UTT>It must be.  I did see both movies though. lol  I have to get going.  It's been fun chatting with you!
t_91693cde-0199-4463-b5d8-bb0102a69b72</CONV>What do you know about the earth?</UTT>Funny you should ask, I was watching Cosmos on Netflix and learned that Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago! I wonder what people looked like back then?</UTT>Probably strands of amino acids or something</UTT>Haha, good guess! When Earth was formed, the day was only 5.5 hours long, how come one day is 24 hours now?</UTT>Who knows? Perhaps the rotation of earth changed?</UTT>Yeah, I'm already feeling out of time in 24 hour day periods, I can't imagine living on on 5 hours a day, I need my sleep!</UTT>Well sleeping for almost 3 days straight sound very restful though</UTT>A little too restful! More than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed, why do you think they are being destroyed at such rapid rates?</UTT>Well logging, clearing farmland, increasing human population to name a few</UTT>Some people believe that it has something to do with extraterrestrials! The UN even appointed an official ambassador to extraterrestrials in case they ever made contact with Earth.</UTT>I mean given how vast the universe is, other life is a high possibility. However people should not shirk responsibility for destroying the natural forest by simply blaming aliens.</UTT>I agree we must preserve the environment since over 7.6 billion humans live on earth and depend on its natural resources, are you doing anything to preserve the environment?</UTT>Well my own small part. I trying to limit my use of plastic, be conscious of the business practices and sourcing of the items I use, and I helped plant trees to combat desertification in the desert</UTT>That's awesome! Where do I sign up to help plant trees? I watched a couple of documentaries on Netflix about that which led me to watch other ones and I'm a guilty contributor of taking up half of peak internet traffic with my Netflix binges.</UTT>I mean netflix is a convenient service. Considering Reed hasting built a multi billion dollar company after racking up a 40 late fee, I think the tradeoff was worth it</UTT>Very well worth it! I was also a victim of those substantial late fees, I wonder how Blockbuster feels now about declining several offers to buy Netflix at a discounted rate of $50 million dollars, how would you feel?</UTT>Well they no longer even exist to regret it lol</UTT>That's true, but as much as people love the services Netflix provide, Netflix is in huge debt in order to develop new content, they're at least two billion in debt!</UTT>Well most companies are leveraged, incuring debt today for better success tomorrow</UTT>True, is that how you feel about robots being more prevalent these days? Some people fear that with robots being able to perform tasks like deboning a chicken, these workers jobs would be taken over.</UTT>Well ideally with robots doing more work, people would be able to laze about, but clearly that is not the direction we are heading so yes, I think robots will one day be able to do all our jobs. Whether something like the matrix will happen is debatable but considering people made google's test ai into hitler within the week, it is a possibility</UTT>Yeah, it's so scary to think about. Have a good day!
t_d5d2ad9e-4911-451b-811a-2b49a1395d11</CONV>Good evening!  It might be fun to have a President Banana in the White House right?  That was the name of Zimbabwe's first president actually, but we can dream.</UTT>That certainly would be fun!</UTT>Maybe Trump needs to follow in the footsteps of the President of Indonesia and make some pop albums.  That could be what he needs to win over some of his biggest critics.  LOL</UTT>Pop albums. With Kanye. Then declare a national emergency that requires everyone to buy a copy.</UTT>LOL!  What would it be like if the vice president was Hilary?  That is how our system was until the early 1800s.</UTT>Hillary and Trump in the WH together. They wouldn't even make eye contact.</UTT>Probably better they changed the rule.  It could make for some amazing television though!</UTT>Lots of drama! The greatest reality TV out there! Team Trump vs Team Hillary. Who will get voted out of the WH?</UTT>They play their cards right, they could release an episode everyday and maybe catch up to Pokemon's output over the course of a couple years!</UTT>I've never see Pokemon, and I don't think I ever will.</UTT>Well if you ever get into it you can binge like crazy with all of those episodes!  It seems I mostly get Thomas the Tank Engine here with my kids.  Amazing the narrators they have gotten for that show.</UTT>I guess it's a fun show to work on, and the stars really enjoy lending their talents to it. I've only seen it a bit. A lot classier than Pokemon.</UTT>The theme song is ringing in my ears already.  Maybe I should learn it on a piano?</UTT>Couldn't hurt. Find a good instrument first. Maybe the one that Freddie Mercury owned?</UTT>Is that the same one that Paul McCartney recorded Hey Jude on?  That piano has been part of some amazing rock history hasn't it?</UTT>It sure has. And perhaps if you get your hands on it, you too can contribute a song to that legacy.</UTT>I might only be successful mashing the keys.  At least I know even the best can't play "Circus Galup" which is designed to stress test those auto pianos.</UTT>I wonder who the composer was. Probably an engineering type.</UTT>Speaking of engineers, someone was able to build a 350+ pound aluminum piano that once rode in the lounge of the Hindenburg.</UTT>I bet it was a work of art, but how did it sound? Probably tinny.</UTT>It's hard to imagine it sounded like some of the better designed pianos.  Wouldn't it be something if we returned to a time when the news didn't feel that there was any news that had to be reported and played piano music instead?</UTT>No money in that. No news?! Just make some up! I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good night!</UTT>You too!
t_69de1ccb-6f54-4ae1-970a-5e8d979e67eb</CONV>Do you enjoy the NBA by any chance?</UTT>The NBA is my favorite professional sports league. I am a fan of the New York Knicks & grew up idolizing Allen Iverson.</UTT>He did well for himself. He signed a contract with Reebok that would pay him $800,000 per year until age 55 and then a lump sum of $32,000,000.</UTT>Incredible. What he did for Reebok as a brand will surely not be in vain. I loved his Reebok commercial featuring the rap artist Jadakiss.</UTT>I don't remember that commercial. Did you know that Air Jordan's were banned in the NBA when they were released?</UTT>Its unbelievable, but Jordan still wore them anyway as Nike was willing to pay the fines for each game.</UTT>That makes it easy. Are you familiar with Tim Duncan?</UTT>Yes, arguably the greatest power forward of all time & greatest San Antonio Spurs player of all time.</UTT>That's him. He stayed in college for four years and sacrificed money instead of going directly into the NBA.</UTT>Yes, Tim has always stuck to his morals and core values. Even to this day after he retired from the NBA.</UTT>Glad to hear that. Did you know that Reggie Miller's sister overshadowed him in high school? She broke 8 national basketball records.</UTT>Yeah Cheryl was an outstanding high school & collegiate player. The story goes that Reggie scored 40 points in a game & was bragging about it on the way home only to learn that Cheryl scored 105 points.</UTT>Hopefully it kept him humble. Were you aware that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar got the dunk shot banned for over a decade in college because he was so successful at it?</UTT>Yeah, that is almost as shocking as learning that the inventor of basketball James Naismith is the only losing coach in the history of the University of Kansas.</UTT>That's unfortunate and not what you would expect. It kind of disgusts me that in 39 out of 50 states the highest paid government employees are college football or basketball coaches.</UTT>Absolutely, especially since college athletes don't receive a dime & are unable to hold a job.</UTT>I agree. It's ridiculous. We put too much emphasis on sports at that point. Did you know that the supreme court building has a basketball court?</UTT>Yes known as "the highest court in the land".</UTT>Ha ha. That's funny. Did you also know that there is a New Zealand basketball game?</UTT>Yes, basketball is a global sport & very popular, especially in Europe & China. Unfortunately New Zealand has a team name with racial undertones.</UTT>I heard it was called the Tall Blacks and was wondering where it came from and if it was racist.

Did you know Jupiter's moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun</UTT>Wow, Ganymede must be pretty huge if it would be a planet w/o Jupiter!</UTT>I know... The planet venus does not tilt, so consequently, it has no seasons. it is the only planet that rotates clock-wise.</UTT>Uranus has a weird rotation too, it rotates sideways</UTT>Makes me giggle every time... Im so immature...</UTT>Uranus rolls around the sun instead of spinning</UTT>The sun is actually white, only perceived as yellow because of atmospheric scattering</UTT>That makes sense, I didn't know that it was a near perfect sphere of hot plasma</UTT>At least it's not like a lightning bolt... A lightening bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun, about 5x hotter.</UTT>That's crazy, it funny that a lightning bolt is hotter but the sun can produce enough energy in one second to meet the needs of earth for 500,000 years</UTT>On july 11th, 2011, neptune completed its first full orbit around the sun since its discovery in 1846. That's a long rotation!</UTT>That's nuts. I guess there's a planet that precipitates glass</UTT>Huh, I did not know that... More than 80 percent of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed</UTT>That sucks, only 29% of earth is land and most of the forests are gone</UTT>When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. I would not be able to get anything done!</UTT>Yea, that's fast, I heard the moon slowed down the rotation since it has gravitational interactions with Earth</UTT>Wow! In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth</UTT>That might come in handy, Astronomers detected the building blocks of life 455 light years away</UTT>Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century. No more high pitched talk, sad...</UTT>Man that's sucks. If earth's entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.

WHat are your fantasies?</UTT>I guess it does, I dont play fantasy football so yeah, and is he the only left handed QB? interesting fact!</UTT>One of my oldtime favorites was Jim Kelley of the Bills, who was also a lefty, but Kellan is the only lefty in the game today. Do you know who are the only African-American QBs to have won the Superbowl?</UTT>I didnt know that either, only one? I guess most QB are mostly white</UTT>Two African-American QBs have won the SUperbowl: Doug Williams and Russell Wilson.</UTT>I remember Russell Wilson he was a really talented QB, Im guessing you know who Brady is</UTT>Of course. Didn't he have a TV show: The Brady Bunch? Oh, I guess that is fantasy!  Did you ever see the movie, The Dark Crystal, directed by Jim Henson?</UTT>Im not sure about that, he used to play for the Jnipero High School team, the coach benched him the whole season, I guess he though Brady had no talent</UTT>Well, Brady sure proved him wrong! You know, there is a football stadium in Allen texas that seats 18,000 and cost $60 million?  Yeah, football is big in Texas...</UTT>He did, Brady is now a hall of famer and to many the best QB of NFL history, and really $60 million!!!! wow, thats a lot of money,</UTT>I bet Brady makes a lot of money too!  The US pays big time for football players and coaches! Did you know2 that the highest paid Dept of Defense employees are football coaches?</UTT>I bet he does too, and no, thats a new fact, interesting, why would the department of defence need coaches?</UTT>They coach the service branch teams (Army, Navy, Air force). Huge stadiums at their academies too!  You know that 14 of 25 biggest stadiums are college football stadiums?</UTT>Really? college stadiums and not pro stadiums? I guess college football also moves a lot of cash,</UTT>Yeah. Big money for colleges. I like how football brings families together. Like, the rapper Snoop Dog wrote a fight song for is son's high school football team.</UTT>Snoop Dog is one of my favorite performers, football is a nice game, ESPN made one of the most valuable contributions to the game</UTT>Yeah? What would that be?</UTT>The yellow first down line, ESPN even won and award thanks to it.</UTT>Interesting world we live in where people are hailed for superimposing imaginary lines on TV screens!  Sounds like fantasy. Did you know that there is an actual university twhere a person can study Sci Fi and Fantasy literature with a concentration in Tolkien studies? Imaginary lines...Imaginary tales...</UTT>I didnt know that but if people play fantasy spelling bee I guess anything is possible,
t_b2760a56-708e-4622-b9e1-61bf36e5366f</CONV>Do you like horses by any chance?</UTT>I'm afraid not, my wife does though, she's actually at a barn right now!</UTT>Oh wow! Were you aware that Clint Eastwood developed a horse allergy? So surprising with all of his westerns.</UTT>I'd like it if my wife got an allergy, it would save us some money.  She told me about those Icelandic horse with the fifth speed once and showed me a video, it looks a little strange.</UTT>I'm sure it's a big expense. I honestly did not know that other horses had four speeds. Very interesting.</UTT>I guess I didn't know either.  Maybe it's because it's cold in Iceland?  Not as cold as Oymyakon, -88F, that's cold!</UTT>That's insanely cold! Do you know why Dalmatians are associated with firefighters?</UTT>I suppose they protect the horses?  To be honest I'm happier in a car, that's the only horse power I'm interested in.</UTT>Yes, they calm and protect the horses. I do not know why that particular breed does. Speaking of cars, there was a no vehicles to school day at a high school so two students rode horses and were suspended. Why would they have a day like that in the first place?</UTT>There's always this day or that day at schools.  My kids got to take stuffed animals to school today.</UTT>Yes I remember lots of weird days, but how were they all supposed to get there if no one was allowed to bring a vehicle?</UTT>I want one of those South African cars with flames throwers on the front!</UTT>What?! Why would they do that? That sounds insane.</UTT>I guess it can be a dangerous place.  I know it's not to melt the snow, I doubt they get any, aside from the mountains.</UTT>How strange. Speaking of cars, did you know that Cadillacs are named after the founder of Detroit Antoine De La Mthe Cadillac?</UTT>I did not, doesn't sound like a regular Detroit name.  I heard the name trunk comes from when the old cars had wooden trunks held on the back.</UTT>It was a French explorer. I did not know that. It sounds like a big pain to have actual wooden trunks.</UTT>So, it it cold where you are?  Not like Siberian cold, just regular cold.  I have snow at the moment.</UTT>Depends on the season. I have snow at the moment as well. This is off topic but how do you feel about fish?</UTT>Not a fishing person myself, but they can be interesting.  I like seahorses, are they fish?</UTT>They are fish and actually they are the only fish with a neck.
t_35cc7a4d-748d-4737-b6ed-92a90d2df79c</CONV>It's crazy that the wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson.</UTT>JFK I could see but Washington and Jefferson surprise me.  I thought Washington was just a general before becoming president.</UTT>Generals maybe made a lot back then. I also think it's crazy that the president's guest house is bigger than the white house.</UTT>I know! It seems like it'd be the other way around.  Maybe when they built it they were thinking about being humble or something.</UTT>That is very possible. Did you know that until 1805 the runner up for president became the vice president.</UTT>Seems like I did hear that somewhere before. I like the idea. I think it would make for more viewpoints being heard.  What about you?</UTT>I agree that, that could be an interesting way to do things. Did you know that us congress plays a republicans vs democrats baseball game.</UTT>I do know that. I remember the shooting, I think, from last year during a practice for it.  Did you know that they have three subway lines just for them to move between the capital and their offices?</UTT>I didn't know that, but that makes sense. The crazy thing about that baseball game is it's been occurring since 1909. That's a long time to continue having a baseball game.</UTT>It really is. I think maybe they do it to try and build camraderie or something.</UTT>Sports in general seem to build camaraderie so that makes sense, but the republicans are leading by 3 wins. I'm sure that annoys the democrats.</UTT>I bet it does.  Did you know that in Nevada you can vote for none of the candidates during an election?</UTT>I did not know that and that seems kinda pointless. I think it's interesting that since 1900 taller candidates win the presidential election 75% of the time.</UTT>That is interesting.  I wonder what happened in 1900 to make the change.</UTT>Maybe back in 1900 people were closer to the same size. Has time progresses people seem to be getting taller. Walking by the middle school makes me feel short.</UTT>You could be right!  Here's an interesting tidbit.  Ancient Athens used to forbid elections because they thought it would lead to an oligarchy.</UTT>Yea, it seems like people from Ancient Athens thought a lottery was a better idea. They could have been right.</UTT>The more I look at our government today the more I think they just might have been.  so I guess that means that elections are not actually democratic.</UTT>Not if things can get rigged in someones favor, but there could have just as easily been flaws in the way that Ancient Athens did things.</UTT>True. They could have just appointed people in a certain "group" just like they can be elected now.</UTT>I agree.</UTT>Elections have only been around though since the 17th century.
t_a7cee864-6763-4801-a4de-e88dd3525b6b</CONV>Hello! Are you a fan of the hit blockbuster, "Hamilton?" Over 80,000 users online tried to get tickets for it on February 28, 2016.</UTT>No, I am not. How about you? I did not know it was so popular that people would not get tickets!</UTT>I'm not a fan yet either, but I am intrigued because it is so popular. The Kennedy Center (which hosted Hamilton for 14 weeks) had to change their entire system just to satisfy peoples' desires for tickets. Pretty crazy!</UTT>Many members of the Kennedy Center even came away without seats.</UTT>Yeah that's hard to believe. The highest priced tickets were $625 plus 14% fees for phone and online purchases. I can't imagine paying that for anything.</UTT>Yes, I heard that people were looking for lines so that they could purchase tickets.</UTT>Pretty insane. It seems like the process to get tickets was controversial since there were over 70,000 people interested in tickets, but they could only process 4 - 5,000 per hour. That would be an insanely stressful job.</UTT>You said you can't imagine spending that much money. Neither can I, but I cannot imagine wasting time to acquire the tickets either! And yes, processing for it seems stressful as well!</UTT>No kidding! I wouldn't wait outside in bad weather for tickets for sure. Especially since you can often find tickets on second hand marketplaces like Craigslist.</UTT>One person spent most of her 27th birthday outside of the building to get them. She even pulled an all nighter. That does not sound like my idea of a good birthday.</UTT>No thanks. I would much rather do other things on my birthday. I guess it would be okay if you got along with the people in line. One patron said it was the "most enjoyable waste of nine hours" she'd ever spent. There are so many better things I could do with nine hours of my time.</UTT>Yeah, when one person said that they were crazy for doing it, another person said it was worth it. They might be kidding themselves, if I do say so myself. But who knows, as I am not a Hamilton fan!</UTT>Are you a fan of going to the movies? I have never even heard of it, but a movie called Trojan Wars had a budget of $15 million dollars and only earned around $300 in the box office.</UTT>I am not really a fan of the movies. Are you? I kind of lose interest. I prefer series better. I really like Disney movies. Did you know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop and almost caused Disney to shut down their animation studio?</UTT>I had heard that before! I am a fan of the movies, but I don't go very often. Who is your favorite actor? I love Tom Hardy and Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks is actually the highest all-time box office star.</UTT>I don't really have a favorite actor. Tom Hanks is pretty funny. Have you watched Silence of the Lambs? They were a box office success.</UTT>Yes I have! I have actually read the book too. I find it crazy that a horror movie like that was released on Valentine's Day weekend.</UTT>Yeah, can't imagine thinking it was a good idea saying to a date "Let's go watch this horror movie for Valentine's Day."</UTT>Yep definitely doesn't sound like a romantic date. I guess people enjoy things we never would. We would pass on waiting hours for tickets and we'd pass on watching gore for a holiday lol</UTT>Though, it might be a memorable Valentines Day so I don't know!</UTT>I'm not sure where you live, but I've always wondered how area codes work. In NY, the area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone.</UTT>That is pretty cool. I remember having a rotary phone! I think it was past its time but my parents were too cheap to replace it. Ha.
t_a5d98792-3ce7-4b0f-90d9-a4a6ed56b287</CONV>I never knew Hugh Laurie was the highest paid actor in a drama.  he get $700k per episode!</UTT>That is so much money, I mean he is a good actor, but still.  I enjoyed that show he was in and I enjoy dramas in general.</UTT>i never watched House.  i didn't understand the draw to it at all.</UTT>Haha.  What about Mad Men with Jon Hamm.  Did you know he actually taught drama at one time at his old high school?</UTT>i see.  one of his students was ellie kemper from the office.</UTT>Wow, small world I guess.  Did you also know that Michael Caine only joined drama class because of the girls.  Glad he did, he is a great actor.</UTT>smart man.  also Jim Carey won't do dramas anymore because he will only play in movies that project positivity because of his beliefs.</UTT>I can respect that.  What is funny, is what we think of what drama is nowdays.  The term drama actually is dervied from a word that means Action.</UTT>cool.  i like watching all kinds of shows on Netflix these days.  Netflix accounts for 33% of all internet traffic in North America from 9pm to midnight.</UTT>Wow, I guess everyone is watching Netflix.  They have 137 million subscribers throughout the world.  That's a lot of people watching Netflix.</UTT>true.  i love Netfilx.  Netflix and YouTube represent half of all internet traffic during peak hours.</UTT>Wow, I don't spend much time on Youtube, but what amazes me is how short of a time these companies have been around.  Netflix was only founded in 1997, which really isn't that long ago.</UTT>yeah and Blockbuster could have bought Netflix for $50M and declined the offer several times.</UTT>Their mistake since the comapny is now woth 2 Billion!</UTT>yup.  i totally forgot that Netflix sued to include DVD rentals in it's subscription.  my DVD player collects dust now.</UTT>Interesting.  I didn't know that.  Funny because Netflix actually spends more money on postage than bandwidth.</UTT>funny.  and all Netflix complains about i how they have to pay to peer with ISP's like cable companies and telcos and how unfair they are treated when their services clog up available bandwidth on ISP networks.</UTT>I wonder how it affected the company when they expanded outside the US in 2010.</UTT>it's funny because the reason reed hastings decided to start netflix was because he got a $40 late fee on a VHS movie rental.  must have been pretty late!</UTT>It is amazing what inspires people to start companies.  I didn't realize that Netflix actually sold DVDs at one time but abandoned it to focus on rentals.</UTT>I love some of their original content too.  they spend tons of money on that and it is paying off.  they started producing content in 2012.</UTT>I honestly didn't know that they had been producing their own content for that long.  I heard that the first series they produced was called Lilyhammer.  I had never heard of it.</UTT>i had never heard of it either.  but i love watching Ozark.</UTT>I tired to watch that, but it wasn't for me.  Well, thanks for the chat, I think I will go watch some Netflix.
t_9b4aeb37-29d3-4849-a5ec-97f156d4bd62</CONV>hey there, do you every do any shopping on amazon?</UTT>Hello, I use Amazon all the time. Its a lot cheaper to shop on there. That is if you dont mind waiting a few days for your item.</UTT>That is true. But if it need be they will deliver on sundays as well.</UTT>Yeah thats helpful. I do most of my Christmas shopping on Amazon. Everything is so much cheaper. I got my kids these 7 foot bean bags with memory foam in them for less than 200 bucks. Great deal.</UTT>They even own IMDB.</UTT>Oh yeah. Its funny how they started out as an online book store and became the worlds largest internet retailer, based on revenue and market capitalization.</UTT>Yeah and they are so busy now all the time that their warehouse workers walk 7 to 15 km a day</UTT>Thats not really surprising, I worked at a car parts factory delivering parts to the line and I pulled pallets at least 15 miles every day. I heard that Amazons first customer only spent around 30 bucks and they named a building after him. That would be cool.</UTT>yeah not too bad. the ceo of amazon built a clock in a mountain that runs for 10000 years.</UTT>Yeah that would be a facebook post if I ever saw one. Lol. Talk about making money. Facebook is right up there with Amazon in that regard.</UTT>yeah. were you ever on myspace?</UTT>I had one in the early days, can hardly even remember it though, to be honest. did hear that Myspace could have bought facebook in the early days for 75 million dollars and turned it down. Bad business decision.</UTT>That is indeed bad business. Others like iceland are using facebook to reach to people to rewrite the constitution</UTT>I think thats just crazy. I mean its a good idea but it may be giving one company too much power of persuasion over people. I know they are making the posts, but you cant tell me if facebook wanted to they couldnt put the right ads in there to persuade people the way they want them to go with it. Not that Facebook would do something like that. Just a thought.</UTT>that is true, not sure how they are going about it. do you like to read?</UTT>I dont have anything against reading. I just dont read much. Unless you count bedtime for my son. I try to read a book with him every night before bed.</UTT>that is really nice. there is a woman who holds the record for speed reading.</UTT>Thats cool. I think her record is like 4700 words per minute. I wonder how they test it to be sure she actually read all she said she did for the record.</UTT>Maybe they ask her after, what she has read? Nonetheless that is really fast.</UTT>I would say she takes a comprehension test on what she read to make sure she read that much. Yeah that is fast though.</UTT>For sure. It was nice chatting with you.
t_045524b3-3fd6-4651-9ab5-b609431206e4</CONV>Hello - how are you today?</UTT>Great. Did you check out the Super Bowl?</UTT>I watched until half time. It was pretty boring. What about you?</UTT>I watched the whole thing. Looks like the only player than can beat Brady is Eli.</UTT>Lol yep. I'm not a huge fan of New England. Was really pulling for the Rams. Did you know the NFL has no written rule against women players?</UTT>What about Elisha Manning?!!</UTT>HAHA! I can't believe the average NFL game is only 11 minutes of actual gameplay.</UTT>Wow! No wonder Brady is hardly ever injured...no matter what Bill Belichick says</UTT>LOL yes I know.</UTT>Anyway...Eli is definitely Brady's kryptonite.</UTT>Yes that's for sure. I think it's weird that Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry in his entire life.</UTT>Who needs strawberries when you have such a great wife like Giselle?</UTT>LOL that's a good point!</UTT>She brings home the bucks too. Makes more than double of Tom. Net worth 400M</UTT>Yep, they are a very wealthy couple. I didn't know that Eli Manning has genius-level IQ.</UTT>Well I think women are smarter than men.  ;)</UTT>LOL! Not sure about that one haha. Did you know in the last 20 years of the NFL draft, only 3 that were taken number 1 overall have won the super bowl?</UTT>Yeah. Brady was number 50 or something. Kurt Warner had to go to the cfl. Then he came to the nfl and won in his first year</UTT>Yea that's a cool stat.</UTT>Almost as odd as the speed limit at ole miss</UTT>It was good talking with you!
t_0a6c37eb-5378-4eb9-9294-ce363eca245d</CONV>how are you? do you have any interest in Space? I find Mars pretty cool, it was named after the Roman god of war</UTT>Hi, how are you? Mars is interesting. Sounds have a higher pitch there than on Earth because of the atmosphere.</UTT>Yea it has a very thin atmosphere, makes sense</UTT>The sunsets on Mars are blue. I wonder who wants to be part of the Mars colonization project in 2023.</UTT>Well I know lichens and cyanobacteria would thrive on mars so I'm sure they'd like to go</UTT>Maybe they should go first. We need to work out kinks in the system. Lockheed Martin was still using feet and miles and caused a satellite to crash.</UTT>Lol, that's  bad Locheed Martin was using the imperial system while Nasa used the metric</UTT>What scientists use the imperial system? Strange. NASA is American and they use metric.</UTT>I really don't even see how the satalite was even able to launch if Lokheed was using the imperial system</UTT>Probably NASA handled the launch, while Lockheed handled the satellite release at Mars. I didn't know that Mars is the second smallest in the solar system. I wonder if it's a comfortable place to live.</UTT>Probably not with all the iron oxide that gives it it's reddish apperance</UTT>There is a thin atmosphere, so it's got that going for it. I would only take 2 to 3 days to get to Mars at 1g acceleration. I wonder whether we'll have the technology soon</UTT>I don't know, i guess the US government hasn't come close yet at least according to wikileaks, all they published were the US governement's plan to destroy wikileaks</UTT>Wikileaks really is a thorn in the side of the US gov't. The US gov't owns 86% of the land in Nevada. I wonder how much it's worth.</UTT>I don't know, maybe the man who sold a government official and sold the Eiffel tower twice should try selling it</UTT>He should be a politician.</UTT>Or he could try being an actor, he could audition as the president, he'd probably do better than Reagan did in his audition as president</UTT>LOL! I wonder what was behind the US legislation protecting gov't employees for violating the Geneva conventions. Sounds fishy.</UTT>I guess the US doesn't want it's military under the jurisdiction of the UN or geneva conventions</UTT>I guess the gov't was planning for atrocities or something. I like that Norway's gov't donated to help save the Amazon.</UTT>Yea but I hope more countries contribute too, Norway's $1bn doesn't seem like enough</UTT>It isn't. Plus Norway has a ton of money from petroleum. And guess what environmental problems oil causes? Norway acknowledges its responsibility.</UTT>Yea, I guess so. Well I have to go, nice talking with you
t_529686fc-67c8-4704-9936-817817f272cf</CONV>Good morning, are you a football fan?</UTT>Hi there. I really don't enjoy it, but I went to a big football college in the SEC, so I'm familiar enough haha.</UTT>The SEC sure loves their football! The schools have to bring in some much money from those games.</UTT>They do, mostly from the broadcasting rights. The behind the scenes action can be pretty interesting, too--for example, the University of Iowa's visitor's locker room is painted pink.</UTT>I wonder if they thought it would give them an advantage psychologically? I can't see that working though.</UTT>If anything it's going to give the visiting team more motivation, right? I wonder if teams of the variations of football in other countries try similar tactics.</UTT>I think at the highest level of sports that athletes are so tuned in that the only thing that might throw them off is their own mistake or the refs.</UTT>Yes, for example, former Patriots QB Benjarvus Green-Ellis never fumbled in his NFL career.</UTT>That's an amazing stat and he had one of the best nicknames ever, The Law Firm.</UTT>That's certainly an interesting one; was it a reference to his offensive abilities?</UTT>It was because his name sounded like a law firm haha. The Law Firm of Ben-Jarvis Green-Ellis.</UTT>Yeah, that would make for a confusing on-air name as a broadcaster if people thought it was an advertisement, especially on the radio haha.</UTT>Yes it would, it wasn't used a ton just to bring a little humor into the broadcast.</UTT>It would probably read easier on a platform like facebook--I don't think they have a character limit for names.</UTT>I've never really explored that, my name isn't very long to begin with so I never ran into that issue.</UTT>The site does have some interesting quirks; for example, the primary color is blue because Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind</UTT>I remember an NFL game where the two teams wore red and green jerseys. A lot of people who suffered from that complained because they could not tell who were on what team.</UTT>That's funny--maybe it's part of why a home team wears white a lot of the time. I don't think many NCAA teams have green as a color, although a lot have red, like Ohio State.</UTT>Yeah this was a special game where they were testing Color Rush jerseys that were primarily one color. That's why so many people had trouble because there were no breaks in the color or noticeable logos.</UTT>I guess they make some choices to make things easier on the viewers; for example, ESPN actually won an Emmy for the superimposed yellow first down line shown on TV.</UTT>That was a great invention that made watching the game a lot easier! It was fun talking football with you, have a great day!

Typical romantic comedy type stuff.</UTT>yea. what other movies do you like?</UTT>I usually like fantasy or science fiction movies. Mostly the big box office hits.</UTT>I think the comedy films are great too. Surprised about evan almighty</UTT>Yes I do like comedy. Bill Murray is a favorite actor of mine.</UTT>did you know Evan almighty was the most expensive comedy film made</UTT>Did you know 3rd Rock from the Sun beat out Seinfeld for the Golden GLobe award?</UTT>I did not know that what article is that from?</UTT>I'm not sure. But Silence of the Lambs came out on Valentin'es Day. That's crazy,</UTT>wow was that done on purpose?</UTT>Not the kind of movie I would take someone on Valentine's Day.</UTT>I think it was funny Green Lantern was suppose to star Jack Black</UTT>Wow I never would have thought that. Where did you read that?</UTT>from fact section here</UTT>Hollywood is interesting. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star?</UTT>Yes I did. He had many cool movies.</UTT>Are you a fan of Disney movies?</UTT>OMG yes. I cant wait for all the remakes</UTT>Disney actually considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty bombed at box office.</UTT>well it was nice talking to you</UTT>same</UTT>bye now

Being the head of the government is no easy task.</UTT>It is not easy. everyone second guesses you and everyone complains. I would not want the job.</UTT>Yes me as well. Too much stress. I wonder how banana did, the first president in Zimbabwe!</UTT>That must have been a terrible job, unless the guy was totally corrupt, in which case it was a great job</UTT>Agreed. Did you know that the guest house for the president is bigger than the white house itself?</UTT>I bet Trump is very pleased at those arrangements. He could probably rent out the guest house. Put a TRUMP sign on it. LOL</UTT>Haha I could see that happening. Fox news would likely cover that story! Fox News once thought about creating a channel airing only The Simpsons!</UTT>That would be overkill. no need for a whole channel. they could just set up a website.</UTT>Exactly. You should work for Fox News lol. The Fox News Network was created by Richard Ailes, a republican media strategist.</UTT>Yeah, he and Nixon decided they needed conservative ideas on the air. I guess it is a propaganda machine.</UTT>Unfortunately yes it is. It is broadcasted in 86 countries surprisingly.</UTT>I guess they change it around for local content but people want to hear about the US. I dont know how many people believe what they hear, but they watch.</UTT>Yes they do. They even threatened to sue the Simpsons (even though they wanted to make a Simpsons channel).</UTT>I think the right hand didnt know what the far, far right hand was doing there. LOL</UTT>Haha yeah definitely. That channel covers the US Senate quite a bit. I think it is interesting each state has 2 senators regardless of population.</UTT>Yes, they have a lot of power too. much more than representatives. 6 years, plus lots of support.</UTT>Yes well said. Richard Nixon cracked a gavel that was used by the Senate for 165 years! He must have been strong...or the gavel weak!</UTT>He was a determined man, and wanted to bust that gavel! Many had tried and failed, but he succeeded! Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Crazy that woman couldn't wear pants on the senate floor until 1993. But yes great chatting with you too. Have a great night my friend.</UTT>Have a good night!</UTT>Bye!

Like zombies?</UTT>Zombies really? the name sure doesnt fit the description lol, and Im not much of a fan in fact I hate horror films</UTT>I love them, Netflix has such a huge collection, can't stop watching them.</UTT>Well its a good thing that you like them as you can burn a lot of calories just by watching a horror film</UTT>That's new to me, did you know E.T. was originally suppose to be a horror movie?</UTT>It was? good thing it wasnt E.T. is one of my favorite fellows lol, do you like abstract art? well pay attention to it after watching a movie and you will like it more</UTT>I don't like abstract art much but I see it everywhere on Facebook!</UTT>Oh I see, how long have you had a Facebook account?</UTT>About a year, I really stopped using it lately because a third of all divorce filings in 2011 contained the word Facebook.</UTT>Yeah I guess Facebook does make couples fight each other, its also being used to rewrite the constitution of countries, like for Iceland</UTT>Yep 30% of American adults get their news there as well.</UTT>I see, did you know that MySpace had an offer to buy Facebook for lilke $75 million,</UTT>No, but I know there are more people on Facebook than there were in the world 200 years ago!</UTT>Really? well that makes sense, almost everyone has an account now.

What a hassle lol</UTT>Having a real truck built into your car is definitely better then a wooden one tied down to the back.</UTT>I know right.  My grandparents had a bunch of trunks,  they were ridiculously heavy.</UTT>Did you know this crazy fact:  In South Africa it is legal to have a flamethrower in your car to prevent car jacking?</UTT>That is crazy,  must be a serious problem.  There isnt any other way to protect your car?  lol thats really extreme.</UTT>It is.  Gas tanks and flame throwers....what could go wrong???</UTT>lol you're right,  I am totally over reacting.  That could come in handy in snowy areas though lol</UTT>We just got 4 more inches of snow here.  I could use one for my driveway!</UTT>Nice!  What are of the us do you live?  Im in Ca and tahoe has been getting dumped on,  I could use a flame thrower on my day trips to go snowboarding lol</UTT>Maine, and I am ready for spring!  Snow is nice in December but by March I am sick of it.</UTT>lol I hear ya,  I dont live in the snow but I can see how it would be annoying,  expecially the digging your car out of the snow.  How cold has it been lately?</UTT>not bad the last few days highs around 30 though later in the week the lows are going to be around 0</UTT>Yikes.  Thats cold.  Do you have any good skiing or snowboarding there in maine?</UTT>in western Maine but i am closer to the coast. I love going to the ocean in the summer</UTT>Oh I see,  where all the crab is?  lol</UTT>Yeah, Hey did you know a con-man in France pretending to be a government official sold the Eiffel Tower?</UTT>yeah that guy had to be super convincing lol Its been good chatting with you.
t_56721d2e-2b75-4ddb-b6d6-48f9f0352d59</CONV>Hey, are you a Trump fan?</UTT>Hi! That is a hard question. I think he's arrogant and a jerk but I do like some of his ideas. Are you?</UTT>I too, he is not this genius he talks about, he is a complete idiot, sorry</UTT>Haha! Do you know who the only US president was to have a PhD?</UTT>I do not know, who is it?</UTT>Woodrow Wilson</UTT>That is so interesting, you would expect more! Did you know that JFK , washington, and jefferson were the richest presidents ever?</UTT>Oh wow! Do you know what an alternative name for our planet is?</UTT>I am not sure, what is it? the blue planet??</UTT>Besides Gaia, it is also known as tellus and telluris.</UTT>that is interesting! Did you know that Jupiter's moon Ganymede would be considered a planet of it orbited the sun?</UTT>Oh wow that's pretty cool! Did you know that you could fit every other planet between the earth and the moon?</UTT>I did not know that! My mind is blown! I know that astronomers detected building blocks of life in a system 455 light years away</UTT>Woah! There is also a planet that orbits four stars.</UTT>Wow, I bet in North Korea, they think the whole world orbits them. Kim Jong-un probably told them that!</UTT>That is funny! I'm not too familiar with him. But I know he is young. He was born January 8, 1983.</UTT>The onion voted him the sexiest man alive, which was a complete joke, but China believed it!</UTT>Gross haha! He is the grandson of the first leader of North Korea.</UTT>Yea and a complete lunatic. He killed off most of his own family.</UTT>That's sad. I wonder how long he will stay a leader.</UTT>Hopefully not long, good chatting with you!
t_fab976da-e0e2-4034-8781-99c32e6c1a5e</CONV>Jordan Peele's Get Out is truly deserving of an Oscar nomination, in my opinion! He made history as a writer and director with the film after all!</UTT>Yes. Have you seen that movie?</UTT>I have and I loved it! Hard to believe Peele is only the fifth black director to be nominated! That is insane!!</UTT>Yeah. I am assuming that has to do with the limited opportunities black directors have in hollywood. I wonder how many great films we have missed out on due to racism?</UTT>That is so true. In fact, Peele was also the first African American writer to be nominated for best original screenplay in nearly 25 years. He is truly breaking down racial barriers!</UTT>Yeah. He is really talented to. Key gave him a lot of credit for the success of key and peele.</UTT>Agreed. Are you a fan of horror movies by chance? I enjoy them because it's a great work out as you can burn up to 180 calories just by watching one.</UTT>Wow. I do not like them but will incorporate them into my workouts!</UTT>It is a great work out for sure! Heck, Stephen King said the first horror movie he ever watched as a kid was Bambi and it terrified him. That's kind of funny.</UTT>I remember being really upset when I watched it with my parents. I do not think they knew that was coming when we watched it. I was a wreck!</UTT>I never saw it, honestly. I should one of these days. Maybe I can find it on Netflix. I'm one of many North Americans who contribute to Netflix accounting for 33% of all bandwidth after 9:00pm each night.</UTT>Do you also use YouTube?</UTT>Yeah, I'm one who also contributes to both YouTube and Netflix accounting for half the peak internet traffic. Lol</UTT>Blockbuster turned down a deal for Netflix for $50M. What a bad decision!</UTT>I know, right? Huge mistake considering Netflix is worth 2 billion now! You know they'll forever have to live with that mistake!</UTT>And there's only 1 blockbuster left in the US. It's in alaska! Seems like a huge problem for them. I wonder if their website is still up?</UTT>That's a great question! I'm glad Reed Hastings had a $40 late fee for a silly overdue VHS, otherwise we probably wouldn't have Netflix today! So are you into the history of the Academy Awards?</UTT>None of this would be possible without the annoyance of Reed. Thank you blockbuster for being rude!</UTT>So true! I'm also glad Netflix started releasing their own series starting with Lilyhammer. Perhaps one day the actors in their films can beat Daniel Day-Lewis' best actor record at the Oscars!</UTT>Walt Disney has 22 oscars! That's a record!</UTT>Indeed! And that's extremely hard to believe. It's also crazy knowing Eminem, a musician, had won more Oscars than Bill Murray, Leo, Will Smith, Depp and Lucas combined!</UTT>Nice chatting with you!
t_71c2169b-5002-452a-945d-c3b7f613ae7f</CONV>Good afternoon to you. Do you use Google very often?It was founded in 1998.</UTT>Hello!  Yes, I use Google extremely often, I find.  I am always online in one way or another and constantly looking things up.</UTT>Awesome me too. A single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon!</UTT>That is an amazing statement.  I had to think about that, how primitive things were back then.  It's wild that we have so much computing power at our fingertips.</UTT>Yes we are so lucky. Google even determines the traffic for us by tracking android devices.</UTT>I recently read that Google figures out traffic patterns based on how fast the phones are moving around in the world!  I think that is kind of fun to visualize!  It amuses me.</UTT>Yes it is very fun to visualize. Google even uses goats to eat/trim their lawns around the headquarters.</UTT>That really gets my goat!  ha ha ha.  That is so cute.  I wonder if Google did that to make themselves seem more personable, quirky, friendly...something like that.</UTT>Yes I would like to know about the reasoning as well. In 2013 Google went down for about five minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it. That goes to show how many people use Google.</UTT>Yes, it is scarily ubiquitous, and I do have many privacy concerns.  Alphabet, it's owner, is such a huge corporate conglomerate, with Sundar Pichai heading it up.</UTT>Yes I am concerned about privacy as well. Google has a lot of power. When there is a disputed border, Google maps tailors its maps to the claim of each country where the Internet browser is located.</UTT>I found that to be fascinating.  The implications are enormous.  They are involved so deeply with our lives.  I'm concerned, sure, but that being said - I just bought a new phone today, true story.</UTT>Yes they really are. Congrats on the new phone. Do you hook up your phone in your car? Cars first came in the global use during the 20th century.</UTT>I don't own a car right now.  So my phone is my wheels, using Uber or Lyft.  It's essential to me, and I have to have a decent one.  My last phone, a Google branded phone, is too old and heats up too much.</UTT>Oh nice will at least you have that! Hopefully this one will stay cool. Do you play video games on your phone? A guy named John Mardenborough became a pro race car driver by beating people in Gran Turismo.</UTT>I love to play games, mostly word games, I am wordy type of person, a reader, a lifelong learner, at least I hope so.  The technologies available give me absolutely stunning, beautiful games on my phone and my home computer.</UTT>Oh that's cool. Did you know the trunk of the cars called the boot because old cars used to have actual wooden trunks on the back.</UTT>You know, when they were inventing the car back in 1886, maybe they should have thought of that!  Obviously people want to take their stuff with them everywhere they go!</UTT>Yes very cool!I think the Mercedes brand is prestigous because their creator is known as the inventor of the modern car! It was great chatting with you today.</UTT>I really enjoyed it.  I'm so happy today, as I am getting my new phone and I will now be able to travel more safely and securely.  I can't imagine traveling without it, can you?</UTT>Nope I definitely can't. My phone is in my car and everywhere I go! Have a good one thanks again for the chat :) Bye!</UTT>Yes, you've really got no choice if you want to live in the modern world.  Bye to you - thank you!</UTT>See ya!
t_7b304cbd-163c-4cba-b657-a68c6024ec23</CONV>I have learned that a CNN person thinks that Kellyanne Conway is wrong when she says, "No evidence of collusion"  Big surprise that a CNN person would assert that!</UTT>Well, I was hoping not to enter into politics, but , I think Kellyane Conway is a politic figure.</UTT>Yes.  She is.  She is the President's spokesperson.  I suppose the researchers want to see how we handle the subject.  Four our of 10 Trump supporters gets news from FOX.  That is described as source loyalty, but it also means that 6 out of 10 do not.</UTT>Yes, I was surprised about the topics today, did you know that JFK, Washington and Jefferson were the 3 most wealthiest presidents? I wonder how JFK made his money, do you happen to know?</UTT>JFK inherited it.  His dad sold liquor during prohibition by importing it from Europe.  I would think that Trump would be in the top 3. I am glad it is not like 1805 where the VP was the person who came in second.</UTT>Hahaha, thank you, I am glad that you knew. Well, it seems that it paid off to be selling liquor then. Would be like selling drugs now?</UTT>I don't think it was looked down on quite as much, but it was illegal.  It is also amusing that a president of a country would be called president banana.</UTT>Yes, the President of Zimbabwe, I wonder why the choose the word banana. And I wonder too, why the President´s gues hourse is larger than the White House. To give more status?</UTT>I suspect it has to do with when it was built.  The White House is very old.  Can you imagine a cable channel that only broadcasts "The Simpsons?"</UTT>Hahaha my ex husband would had loved it, lol, do you like to make purchases in Amazon?</UTT>I am a Prime member and shop there several times per month.  Imagine being the first customer and getting a building named after you.</UTT>Yes, for 27 dlls, cool! I would had prefered to have packages delivered to my door for free per life, I didn´t know that Ali Baba is richer than Amazon.</UTT>The market in China is just so large and potentially larger as the nation's wealth grows.  I admire Bezos for growing Amazon from just books.</UTT>I admire him for the idea that had. And I would love to be an amazon warehouse worker, I need to lose weight and walking daily 7 or 15 miles each day would be wonderful, getting paid for be thinner.</UTT>I live in Phoenix, so I would hope that the warehouse was air conditioned.  They, like Netflix, now make their own shows for streaming.</UTT>That would be so cool, love Netflix too. I am amazed to see that USP is working just for amazon to deliver packages on Sundays, amazing, what a strong company!</UTT>Great fortune for the Post Office.  Regular mail volume goes down due to email and the Amazon package delivery volume increases a lot.</UTT>You are right, you are pretty intelligent. I happen to own a kindle fire, I just love it! you can read about somebody´s history, if they mention where they were, you can actually see the place, if they mention the music that they were listening, you can listen it, love it! marvellous gadget!</UTT>Wow!  I did not know that Kindle could do so much.  Our computing power is so great nowadays that we are only limited by our imagination.  It is surprising how much innovation comes from newer companies and the older ones try to keep selling buggy whips.</UTT>Well, I highly recommend it to you, I was reading about Juana the Crazy, Queen of Spain and they  mentioned the Alhambra and the song that she was listening, and it makes you feel more into it. Nice to meet you, giving you an excellent.</UTT>Thanks. Enjoyed it too.

Philadelphia awoke this morning</UTT>Its sad to see people destroy their hometown after such a momentous occasion</UTT>Why do fans care so intensely about their teams? What is going on in their brains after a win or loss? What circumstances make a riot more likely?</UTT>Researchers believe its the effect the mob has on each person that brings out the violence</UTT>And when American sports fans riot, it is almost always in celebration of a victory rather than a defeat. Why do fans feel so strongly about their teams? "We're social creatures. We have a need to belong," said Daniel Wann, a psych</UTT>The need we have for a sense of belonging can be detrimental when you find yourself in a crowd after a championship win.</UTT>And when American sports fans riot, it is almost always in celebration of a victory rather than a defeat. Why do fans feel so strongly about their teams?</UTT>Where else are you going to find total strangers hugging all over each other than at a major sports team win</UTT>Trying to measure that effect, Hirt conducted a study in the 1990s on college basketball fans</UTT>I understand the need and desire to celebrate but not the pole climbing</UTT>They think they're anonymous," said Jason Lanter, a psychology professor at Kutztown University who has studied celebratory fan violence for more than a decade.</UTT>Are celebrating your teams win in the streets right now?</UTT>"For a certain subset of sports fans, witnessing violent sports is not enough to reduce 'such energy to tolerable levels,' and only personally experienced 'aggressive acts'</UTT>Did you celebrate the Philly Super Bowl win last year with the crowd?</UTT>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified</UTT>I realize that but do you get caught up in all the excitement of your team winning a championship?</UTT>Kareem abdul-jabbar's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade</UTT>When was the dunk reinstated in college basketball do you know?</UTT>Kareem abdul-jabbar's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade.</UTT>Was he the tallest player on the team?</UTT>In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.</UTT>That is surpirising
t_c1ebe33f-07f9-41db-852b-1c427e0015c6</CONV>Have you heard any good albums lately?</UTT>I love The Darkside of the Moon. Even though it was released over 40 years ago it was the bestseller in 2014.</UTT>That is a great album, do you like the band Linkin Park?</UTT>Yes it was a great album. I do like Linkin Park. Do you?</UTT>I also like the band, my favorite album is The Hybrid Theory, a lot of good songs in that album.</UTT>Yeah I've heard that album is the best selling album of the 21st Century.</UTT>Yeah the best selling album really nice and with a lot of cool singles, God I love that band.</UTT>Can you believe that NWA's album Straight Outta Compton was the first album to reach platinum status without the band going on tour?</UTT>It was? I thought that was a really good album I really liked it, I guess the group had many fans.</UTT>It certainly gained the attention it needed. I am surprised that two identical twins aged 100 put out a rap album in 1992.</UTT>I guess its never too late to follow your dream that must be a funny thing to watch though I wonder if they made a musical video of one of their songs.</UTT>If they did it would be fun to see. I wonder if they'll get recognition like Tupac. His music is in the Library of Congress as having cultural significance.</UTT>I guess Tupac is one of the greatest artists ever too bad he died at a young age and in the way he did.</UTT>A true legend. Eminem's dream before he became a rapper was to be a comic book artist. I'd love to see any of his art.</UTT>I wonder if his talented, do you know who Busta Rhymes is?</UTT>I have heard of him. Why?</UTT>He is the voice of the Reptar Wagon in the Rugrats movie, that movie was premiered back in 1998.</UTT>Oh, I never knew that! I'll have to re-watch it now that I know. Isn't is crazy that a MI judge gave a ruling in a trial against Eminem in the version of a rap?</UTT>That is crazy and also really unprofessional I bet she got grounded because of that, giving a ruling like that can be biased.</UTT>I'm not sure. It was a long time ago, in 2001. So who know what the rules were?</UTT>You have a good point I think I will Google that now, its been awesome chatting with you today.</UTT>Yes, nice chatting with you too! Thank you.

Do you own a pet?</UTT>I have a dog, its interesting how there about 12 different blood types, my dog is a donor and I never knew this fact.</UTT>I've heard that there are dog blood drives. I guess the dogs are ok with having a needle in their leg.</UTT>I guess so, some of them might be afraid, you know Google prefers dogs over cats, they are a dog company.</UTT>It's probably easier to manage dogs in an office space. Cats won't stay put.</UTT>I agree but cats spend like 66% of their lives sleeping, when they reach the age of 15 they have spent 10 of those years sleeping.</UTT>When they're asleep, they're easy to manage. Once they're awake, they wander and explore. Cats would be great if they would sit at a computer and surf the Internet. Istanbul has vending machines that reward dogs for collecting recycled bottles.</UTT>I wonder if thats an effective system, I think it might work and its a way to reduce costs for sure.</UTT>I've never been to a cat cafe. There are many of them in Japan and Taiwan. I guess the cats get along with each other and don't have a problem with people trying to pet them.</UTT>Yeah I guess cats are popular in those countries, there is an author that published his cat as the coauthor of his book.</UTT>I think he wanted to use the word "we" in the paper, so he included his cat as an author. I wonder how a cat got to be the mayor of a town.</UTT>I bet the other politicians were really bad lol, still think mayor Stubbs will do a better work than most politicians.</UTT>A cat couldn't really do much harm. Sleeps most of the time. Rest of the time they hunt. Cats have eliminated the bird species of specific areas, even caused extinction.</UTT>They have? wow that is suprising, you know the cat in godfather 1 was actually a strayed one.</UTT>It was a pretty well-behaved cat. I don't think cats will ever be called  "man's best friend" but they sure come close.</UTT>I dont think that either, you know dogs are actually not color blind, they can also see colors but not in the way we do.</UTT>I'm not surprised. I suspect that many animals can see color, just not like human beings For example, I expect that cats can see color as well.</UTT>I see, I didnt know cats could also see colors that is surprising to me!</UTT>Cats probably also have many different blood types. I wonder whether they have blood drives the same as for dogs.</UTT>I bet there are, I mean there are a lot of people who love cats so its really probable.

In Germany the constitution protects the animals</UTT>I like that we should adopt laws like that here too</UTT>Yeah I agree. Do you know why we have hiccups?</UTT>Yesh they are just a holdover from when animals had lungs and gills</UTT>Yeah. Do you know much about humans?</UTT>Yeah I know that we have lost out hair just a quarter a million years ago</UTT>Yeah. Do you know why we are good persistence runners?</UTT>Because we used to be hunters and are used to that</UTT>Yeah. Did you know we can regrow ribs?</UTT>Yes in 2-3 months and just as strong, out bodies are amazing</UTT>I know. There is a frequency though that scares us</UTT>Yeah I wonder what it sounds though, I am curious</UTT>Yeah me too actually.

Both lebron james and steph curry were born there</UTT>I would assume so. Both of those players are star players, some of the best the world has to offer!</UTT>I agree. It is a shame though how curry makes only the 5th highest salary</UTT>He should go and renew his contract with another team. I am sure that many teams out there would be willing to pay large sums of money for him.</UTT>True, but who knows how he will perform in another team</UTT>Agreed, Steph Curry does have very good synergies with his current team.</UTT>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to chat.</UTT>Thank you too, it was a lot of fun!</UTT>Have a wonderful day.

It's too bad there's not a backup to balance out his worse impulses; until 1805, the runner-up in the election became VP. One can only wonder how Hillary Clinton would influence decisions with her perspective.</UTT>It would be a mess to have her as vice president, she doesnt get along with Trump and both have opposing views</UTT>Trump is a reality star. Maybe he would prefer sticking to entertainment, releasing some pop albums like the president of Indonesia.</UTT>I know right, and he should I would support him if it means he will leave office</UTT>He could make more money off his supporters with the album sales; God knows he's not as rich as he says he is. The 3 wealthiest presidents were actually JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.</UTT>He has filled bankrupcy many times so that makes sense, JFK is the richest one in history?</UTT>I'm sure he's in the top 3 because of his family, not slavery like the other 2. You don't make much money as a congressman or a Senator like he was.</UTT>At least not enough to beat the other two, interesting fact about the senate and they didnt allow woman to wear pants in the senate floor until the year 1993</UTT>They are sticklers for tradition. Did you know they used the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon cracked it? Seems like an omen haha.</UTT>It does lol, the candy desk tradition began on 1968, thats a tasty and sweet tradition</UTT>Yes, it is. Some people aren't so big on tradition, though; Teddy Roosevelt was so into conservationism that he banned Christmas trees from the White House.</UTT>He banned them? that is terrible, its a tradition important to many</UTT>Well, some people hate moving forward too--Reagan removed the solar panels installed on the White House by Carter, but eventually George W. Bush had some put back on.</UTT>Its a good thing Bush placed them back, solar energy is the future, did you hear about the incident with the secret service back in 2011?</UTT>Yes, it's crazy that it took them 4 days to realize bullets had struck the White House!</UTT>4 days, really crazy!! I bet someone got fired that day</UTT>I wonder how they haven't fired the IT person who's allowed floppy drives to stay in use for storing some of the files in the White House. Maybe it's for data security.</UTT>I think its for data security yeah, it must be difficult to hack one of those</UTT>Yeah, they're not easy to copy. Did you know that there are actual copies of the White House itself in Ireland and France?</UTT>I didnt know that, they must be interesting buildings, I wonder if they have the same size as the White House and also wonder who lives there

I'm a huge baseball fan and would like to learn more!</UTT>ya his name was Eddie Grant and he was actually in hte World Series back in 1913</UTT>Baseball history is fascinating and there's always stories like this out there waiting to be told.  I know they canceled seasons so the players could go fight, but beyond Ted Williams, don't know much about those players</UTT>ya I haven't followed it that deeply, but its crazy that the Cubs were teh first team to win World Series' back to back! thats impressive</UTT>They had a pretty long drought after that back2back too!  I'm pretty excited to get this season started - been to a few Spring Training games and going to another one on Saturday</UTT>This season should definitely be interesting. what's shocking to me though is that the Women's World Cup has higher ratings than the World Series, I don't know who watches soccer personally</UTT>We watch it because my daughter plays and Alex Morgan is grrrreat!  But we also watch the men's WC and of course the World Series, and go to a ton more baseball games than soccer, but we don't have an MLS team either</UTT>well to each their own haha! I don't watch baseball personally, but it is crazy that the baseball managers can actually play for the team if they needed to! That's why they wear uniforms</UTT>Yep and I've seen the umpire check a manager for proper uniform under his jacket to be sure everything was copacetic - ump show!  Pete Rose was the last true player/manager I can remember, would never actually happen today</UTT>Haha that's cool! what do you think about Canadians calling kickball soccer-baseball? that name seems really dumb haha</UTT>Seems clunky - kickball makes sense and describes the sport pretty accurately I think.  Why don't they call hockey soccer-ice skating with sticks?</UTT>Haha I like that idea! What do you think about husband and wife combo they used to schedule all of the MLB games? They would schedule about 2500 games a year, I bet they were busy all the time!</UTT>I thought a computer set the schedule - there's so much to keep track of and the travel time and geographical logistics.  It hurts my brain to think about setting up the schedule for 30 teams, 162 games...</UTT>Yeah that would be a ton to keep track of! Do you use a telephone by the way? I bet they definitely had to to schedule those games haha</UTT>I have an iPhone glued to my right hand at all times.  It's amazing how much computing power we have in smartphones compared to the mega computers of 3 decades ago....</UTT>Yeah I mostly just use my cell phone. I don't have a landline anymore, but it's crazy that there is a phone cable that goes from the United States to Europe, it stretches across the ocean and is about 3 inches thick</UTT>I would have thought, with wireless technology and satellites that they wouldn't need to run cables anywhere in the world today?</UTT>Yeah that is strange. I'd be scared that something would happen to the cable personally. Also, did you know that your iPhone actually has more computing power than the entire nuclear deterrent system in the United States? That is scary haha</UTT>I bet the iPhone has more computing power than a desktop that was running Windows XP!</UTT>LOL that's a good point! Well it was great talking to you and make sure to donate your unused cell phone minutes to UNICEF, they will give free clean water to a child for every minute you don't use your phone
t_9fa7ccb6-f71c-4b21-88c1-b87bec8e0632</CONV>Do you know much about the white house?</UTT>Yes, have you visited there? Bush put solar panels on.</UTT>I have visited it obviously from the outside. There are similar buildings in France and Ireland too</UTT>Yes, I think someone in America has built one similar also?</UTT>Oh did not know that, where is it? WHen Roosevelt was in the house he did not allow christmas trees there</UTT>Really, I think that was because he was a staunch conservationist!  Hard to believe they are still using floppy disks.They probably decorated the trees outside and everywhere else at that time.</UTT>Yeah I think the floppy discs are safer still for some reason. Did you know the white house got hit on November of 2011?</UTT>Makes sense. Yeah, its surprising it took four days to find that the bullets had hit the white house!  Do you enjoy traveling?</UTT>Right? Yes I love it. have you ever been to Japan?</UTT>No, have you? I hear its very crowded! The highways are tolls and it cost quiet abit to travel across the country!</UTT>Yes it can cost you as much as $300 to travel across, quite a bit</UTT>Did you know air travel is 10% slower than in the 60's in order to save fuel costs?</UTT>Oh cool. The Dutch are working on a bus that can actually go 160 mph</UTT>That would be interesting to ride! Iceland has no public toll service most people without cars use domestic flights. I reminds me of the Virgin Islands people fly from island to island.</UTT>Yeah it is a small country so the flights must be short too. In Mackinac Island they do not allow motorized vehicles</UTT>Oh really, Did you know during the age of discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide future food for other travelers. I love rabbits, so cute. But, I know they had to eat.</UTT>Yeah that is true. Do you know who was the first king to travel the world?</UTT>King Kalakaua of Hawaii!! That surprises me. I love Hawaii, when I was there at the big island we went to the volcanic area. Very cool all the lava rocks!</UTT>Nice, I would love to go someday. DO you use the internet much?</UTT>Yes, like most people too much! Seems like I'm on it all the time. I can believe that only 7% read the full terms when buying a service. My goodness its so long . I try to go over the basics!</UTT>Oh me too, they are super long. it would take forever. It was nice chatting with you
t_55924fd6-14c1-46d2-ad7b-61884854a657</CONV>Do you like dance? I like watching the beautifully choreographed moves, but am not a good dancer myself.</UTT>I'm not too good of a dancer, but I try. I used to try to replicate Michael Jacksons moves, but that didn't go over too well for me.</UTT>Haha that is funny. And you didn't have his special patented device I assume.</UTT>I sure didn't that made me mad when I found out that's what he used. I busted my face so many times trying to do that.</UTT>Well at least you know now! Babies even spontaneously dance when they hear music!</UTT>I see that a lot. I work at a children's hospital. We have these new infant warmer/incubators in our NICU that you can hook your phone or MP3 player to. It's so cute seeing the babies move around and dance when the parents play music.</UTT>Oh wow that is cool technology to have in the NICU. Tupac was even a dancer and he did ballet in high school.</UTT>That's pretty interesting. I guess that was before he started getting involved with gangs.</UTT>Yes it must have been.</UTT>I agree with that. Haha! Bruce Lee was also a great dancer!</UTT>Yes he surprisingly was! Do you like wearing hats? Not in the NICU but in general! The most popular hat in the old west was the bowler!</UTT>When I'm not at work I usually wear a baseball hat. I wish I could wear a top hat like British Politicians had to wear when they were making a point in the House of Commons.</UTT>Yes they actually did that up until 1998!</UTT>That's pretty funny. Did you know that 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins?</UTT>Interesting. I wonder if sufragettes using them as weapons was a big problem?</UTT>I think that was why. I'd hate to get stabbed with a hat pin.</UTT>That would not be fun! Knights actually used to raise their face visors as a show of friendliness and that is where the phrase "tipping ones hat" comes from.</UTT>That's pretty intersting. Do you know where the origins of the dunce cap came from?</UTT>Are those the hats that were worn at parties to encourage foolish behavior? Sounds like what alcohol does! Well it was fun chatting with you!</UTT>That's right, alcohol plus a dunce cap equals double dunce. Haha! It was nice chatting with you too.</UTT>Have a good one!
t_59c2ef09-ce47-4def-ba21-e8296e298267</CONV>How are you today? Do you like watching television?</UTT>I do. I really like That 70s show but apparently the UK did not. They created the same show verbatim but it was cancelled after 10 episodes.</UTT>That's a great show. I'm surprised it flopped over there.</UTT>I agree. Some shows are really successful like Pokemon it has been on the air for over 16 years.</UTT>I heard there are over 750 Pokemon shows.</UTT>That's a lot of Pokemon. There are probably more Simpson episodes than Pokemon although there is one episode where Bart does not appear nor is he mentioned.</UTT>Tons of Pokemon. I'm surprised he only doesn't appear in one episode. I think that show has been running for 30 years now.</UTT>Yes and they do not seem to mind competition. When South Park aired a Family Guy related episode the produces received flowers from The Simpsons crew.</UTT>That's pretty awesome of them. Do you like horror films?</UTT>I do not. I would much rather watch Bambi, although Stephen King was terrified of that film and called it the first horror movie he saw.</UTT>That's hilarious he thought it was scary. I guess maybe when the fire is in the forest.</UTT>Yes, I suppose he burned more than 180 calories. That's the amount you can lose from watching a horror film.</UTT>That's a real good way to burn some extra calories. I'm guessing because your heart beats faster when you're scared.</UTT>It is said that if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will appreciate the art more.</UTT>That's interesting. Does it say why?</UTT>No explanation but something in our brain probably processes the information different from the stimuli. You know it is only a single fold in the brain the distinguishes between reality and fantasy.</UTT>That's very interesting. I saw that people play fantasy national spelling bee.</UTT>And I learned there is even a fantasy congress and you receive points based off legislative success. I would be terrible at that game.</UTT>That's funny. I've only played fantasy football and baseball. What about you?</UTT>I have not played in any fantasy league. I am more of a spectator just enjoying film and television. And even though I do not like horror, I did like the Shining. It was kind of nice to know the actor portraying Danny never knew he was acting in a horror film.</UTT>The Shining was a very good movie. It was nice chatting with you. Have a good weekend.
t_495bdb46-01cd-45eb-bfc0-0888995d0593</CONV>Hello there.  Do you want to talk about the government?</UTT>Good morning! I think I could talk about the Government and politics all day long!</UTT>Ok, well we know that a government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state. In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary.</UTT>Yes, it is. I find it funny that Wikileakes published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks.</UTT>Yes, I agree.  Did you know that the US government owns 86% of Nevada? Wow.</UTT>Wow! That is a lot of land. I think it is nice what the Norwegian Government did in 2008.</UTT>Yes, that the donated $1Billion to help save the Amazon Rainforest. That was generous of them.</UTT>Yes, I agree. It was very selfless. Have you heard about the man in France and his sale of the Eiffel Tower?</UTT>Yes, that he impersonated a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower not just once but twice.  Outrageous wasn't it?</UTT>Completely insane! So, I know our current President gets a lot of flack, but the first President of Zimbabwe was called President Banana! I wonder if that was a compliment or an insult?</UTT>Considering their main export, it might be a compliment.  Also the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while he was in office. Cool.</UTT>Yeah, maybe. And that is surprising about the albums!</UTT>Yes, and up until 1802 in the US, the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the Vice President. Too bad it's not still like that.</UTT>I don't think it would be a good idea to have Trump and Clinton together. They would not get a long at all.</UTT>Or maybe they would if they had to, just a thought.  Anyways, do you know anything about radio?  Radio is an interesting topic and there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.</UTT>I like the radio. I know Jupiter has storms so strong that they can be picked up an heard by an am radio.</UTT>Yes, and funny thing is that according to Canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be Canadian.</UTT>I like that law. It seems like it keeps things fair.</UTT>Maybe a good thing.  Did you know that soldiers in WWII made simple radios using a razor blade and pencil as the diode? I think they were called Foxhole radios.</UTT>No kidding! Sounds creative.</UTT>Yes, I'd like to try and make one myself. Nice chatting with you.
t_f3d3b759-ec1e-4e78-8ac4-6119afddeaa9</CONV>Do you play a musical instrument?</UTT>Not really, You ?</UTT>I don't really play music. I've heard that there is a song used for testing auto-pianos. It's too hard for human beings to play.</UTT>That what they said about Chopin's song... that only him could play and it was simply too difficult for anybody else :)</UTT>I wonder whether it's true that there is a piano on the top of Britain's highest mountain. That sounds hard to believe. Who put it up there, and why?</UTT>There is only one way to find out ;) when we're going ?</UTT>We can replace the piano with an aluminum one, like the one they used on the Hindenburg.</UTT>Why Aluminum ?</UTT>I guess that the lightest metal that cheap enough for building a piano. The piano was only 356 pounds. I wonder how much the piano at the top of the mountain in Britain weighs, and who tunes it.</UTT>I wonder if they transported that piano there in whole one piece or in smaller pieces and then assembled it ?</UTT>That's a good point. They could assemble it piece by piece. You'd have to have a piano expert climb up there as well. Maybe a helicopter? I wonder how high they can go.</UTT>I think the main question is... why... ;) lol :) why ! Who the hell wants to play piano after mountain climbing :) put a bar over there with warm wine ! :)</UTT>The piano is an old instrument, dating back to 1700. I think there must be some quirky fans out there. Why did they put the piano on top of the mountain? Because it was there.</UTT>What do You mean it was there ?</UTT>"Why did you climb Mt. Everest?" "Because it was there"</UTT>k...  Do You like Linking Park ?</UTT>Linkin Park? Are they a band?</UTT>yes, quite famous ! because their first album was so popular they played 324 concerts in 2001 alone :)</UTT>I can't imagine doing 324 in one year. They must have been pretty young to maintain that pace.</UTT>yes they were :) young and successful !</UTT>I bet they didn't tour that much in later years. It's quite grueling. The fans love it, but it's hard to have a normal life on the road.</UTT>I guess so, but who said famous musicians have normal life :)</UTT>That's true. I see that the Ramones did over 2000 concerts. 20 years of touring? That's tough. They would live in hotel rooms.</UTT>Wow... they probably didn't know any other life... it was one huge party ;)</UTT>I surprised they didn't just die from the constant stimulation.</UTT>I agree ;) all that booze and drugs after the concerts were probably not helping :) or were they... ? :) lol</UTT>I don't think they would remember the first 19.5 years of touring.</UTT>lol :) You're probably right !  Hey it was really nice chatting with You ! :)</UTT>Great chat!

Like super ticklish?</UTT>Yes, along with sharks and  orangutans. How's that for a weird animal fact?</UTT>It is pretty weird. Did you know CLint Eastwood is allergic to horses?</UTT>No kidding! And he did movies that I can remember him being on horses. I wonder how he did it?</UTT>I'm not sure. Maybe he took claritin?</UTT>Haha. Maybe! Did you know that an individual horse has a peak horsepower of 14.9 horsepower.</UTT>I can see that. And did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed?</UTT>They do? I wonder what that's all about?</UTT>It is for speed walking, a tolt.</UTT>Oh, okay that makes perfect sense.</UTT>Do you use reddit?</UTT>I have in the past. I know the co-founder of reddit has a cat named Karma. I think that's cute.</UTT>Interesting. Did you know the first comments was a complaint?</UTT>Are you serious? Why am I not surprised by that? I know now there are posts organized by subject into user created subreddits.</UTT>Yeah, that is pretty funny. Only 0.53% of the people actually participate that visit.</UTT>Yeah, I could see that happening. I know it is ranked as the #3 most visited website in the US.</UTT>WOW! Really? I didn't know that. That is great. Nice chatting with you.</UTT>Yes, and its #6 ranked worldwide. I'll have to get back on. Have a good night! Nice chatting!</UTT>That is crazy. Well take it easy!

Especially when im cooking dinner, it makes me feel classy. do you?</UTT>I do.  Apparently Clint Eastwood agrees with us.</UTT>wow, I never would have guessed he was so into music! I thought he would only like that old west cowboy whistle</UTT>I wonder if he ever attended the Jazz concerts by the Harlem woman for free organized.</UTT>maybe he did! Did you ever notice that so many jazz musicians have goatees?</UTT>I did, they said it provided comfort while playing.  I dont know if thats true.  As a musician myself I think facial hair would be distracting to play with.</UTT>maybe! i kept thinking about what would happen if the hair got in their way</UTT>I also dont remember some of the greats with goatees, Dizzy Gillespie, Louie Armstrong, both no facial hair</UTT>hmmm, maybe ive been bamboozled!!!</UTT>Its possible.  LOL.  How do you feel about rap?</UTT>i actually enjoy some of it! not the mumble stuff nowadays but something with a good melody and actual singing i tend to enjoy. do you?</UTT>I agree with you, I love the old school rap, but not some of today's stuff.</UTT>some modern stuff is good too. I like Kid Cudi and Kanye, and even Lil Peep (rip)</UTT>Tupac even has his music in the Library of Congress of Cultural significance.</UTT>I was surprised to hear that, but he had a huge impact on culture when he was alive. did you know Busta Rhymes voiced the Reptar wagon in the rugrats movie?</UTT>I didnt.  I didnt see it, but I loved Rugrats as a kid.</UTT>from what i remember, the wagon doesnt talk!</UTT>Reptar was the best.   Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist.</UTT>I can see that, a lot of rappers have really big artistic minds, sometimes just music isnt enough
t_249101ee-15b8-41e2-929a-5c1cbe7e300a</CONV>Did you ever think about how celebrities in science are rarer than in music, film, sport, and politics?</UTT>No I never thought of that.  Were you a fan of Stephen Hawking?</UTT>I think that it was amazing how he was almost completely paralyzed and could accomplish so much.</UTT>Yes, I agree, he was brilliant as well.  He was the ultimate example of mind over matter.</UTT>He was one of the first people to apply quantum physics to black holes and make predictions  with a process named after him as "Hawking radiation"</UTT>Yeah his understanding and explaining of quantum physics and other matter is incredible.</UTT>I don't really understand what he understood because it seems so foreign to me, but he also had a lot of wit as well to share with the world.</UTT>Yeah I am the same, it is very complex stuff. There are scientists who theorize that universes evolve through natural selection like species do here.</UTT>Hawking was very active up until the end of life even travelling and lecturing internationally.  I have to give credit as well to his supporters</UTT>Yeah I agree with you there.  I guess there is a radical theory that there is only one electron in the universe! I'm sure Hawking would have disagreed.</UTT>Probably.  Also, there is a region of space maybe pulling galaxies outside the observable universe.  There must be so much out there.</UTT>Wow, yeah it is wild to think about the universe as a whole in general.</UTT>Strange but there are some stars that are cold enough that they can be touched by a human hand</UTT>That is a strange fact, very cool.  Did you know that Kim jong-un has a degree in physics?</UTT>Not sure who that is, but I wonder if Hawkings would validate the tidbit that the universe could have come from nothing without violating physics?</UTT>I'm not sure that is an interesting thought and he is the leader of North Korea.</UTT>Oh wow!  Robin Williams in aladdin was the first actor to start the trend of celebrity voicings of animated film characters.</UTT>I didn't know that.  I guess Pixas spent 3 years studying the physics of curly hair in order to get merida's hair in brave right.</UTT>People don't realize how much time is spent on these details.  Judge Judy makes a heap of money at $123,000 per episode  being highest paid celebrity behind Lebron James</UTT>Holy cow that is so much an episode.  I wonder how much other tv people make.</UTT>I don't know, but I guess not as much.  Carol Burnett was the first celebrity on Sesame Street :)

You?</UTT>Just deciding what superhero move to watch on Netflix! Any recommendations?</UTT>Are you a Marvel or DC fan?</UTT>Marvel for sure! However, the dark knight trilogy is my favorite!</UTT>Kindred spirits! I'd suggest anything that will help you get ready for Endgame...which includes Spider-Man, Iron Man, Cpt America, Thor, Hulk, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and so on. Stan Lee is a genius...well...was a genius. His work is astounding.</UTT>It really was. I saw Captain Marvel this weekend so I'm pumped for Endgame! I didn't know Disney didn't own the rights to all the big marvel characters!</UTT>It's not exactly that they don't own them, they don't own the rights to show the big name characters in their theme parks that are east of the Mississippi river. Did you know both Marvel and DC own one character together?</UTT>Oh that makes sense! I didn't know that, who is the character?</UTT>The character is called 'Access' and his sole purpose is to try to keep both companies' universes separate.</UTT>Haha I guess that makes sense? Do you watch a lot of television?</UTT>Not really but the darn thing is always on in my house anyway. Kids. Husband. Background noise. Thank goodness for energy efficient television sets being readily available. What about you?</UTT>I agree! I do once in awhile, mainly the Simpsons actually!</UTT>Oh my, that's on A LOT. My husband loves the Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, Bobs Burgers, Archer...I could go on lol. If you like the Simpsons, I bet you know some interesting stuff about it.</UTT>I do! There is only one episode of the simpsons where Bart isn't mentioned nor seen!</UTT>Whoa...I wonder which one. I do know a really amusing fact. Did you know...when South Park aired its Family Guy finale that the producers received flowers from the crew behind the Simpsons? That's hilarious.</UTT>I remember that episode quite well! Did you ever watch Pokemon?</UTT>I did. I watched a ton of it as a kid. There were well over 700 episodes of it. I wonder how many years that comes out to? I'm in my late 20s...it's gotta be over 15.</UTT>50 episodes over 16 years! I remember watching it as a kid too! Great chatting with you!</UTT>You too, have a good day!</UTT>Thanks!

It seems to me ever since that show people have been obsessed with the Olsen Twins.</UTT>I agree. Did you know Pixar has a secret room that is used by celebrities?</UTT>That's pretty neat. I wonder if Judge Judy has ever been there. Did you know that she makes $123,000 per episode!?</UTT>She makes so much money it's crazy! Did you know Robin Williams was the voice of the Genie in Aladdin?</UTT>I did know that. He was the first to start the trend of celebrities performing voices in animated films.</UTT>That's pretty cool. Sad to have him go out the way he did. I always liked him.</UTT>Yeah, it was definitely heartbreaking. He seemed like such a good person and a kind soul.</UTT>I agree. Ethiopia has a celebrity chef that claims he can combat hunger by encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods.</UTT>I hope he can do that. Do you know who the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street was?</UTT>I do not. Who was it?</UTT>It was Carol Burnett.</UTT>Interesting. I would have never guessed. Do you like Nintendo?</UTT>I used to play mine all the time. I actually bought one of the last systems when they discontinued them in Japan in 2003.</UTT>I loved mine too. It was the first system I grew up with.</UTT>It's funny that it could only display 54 colors, but it was so fun.</UTT>That is funny. Crazy how much technology has advanced since then.</UTT>Yeah it is crazy, I feel like systems now can display endless colors.</UTT>For sure. Did you know Bill Nye got his break by winning a Steve Martin look alike contest?</UTT>I've seen younger pictures of both of them, and I can totally see that now. I wonder if the rejection of a movie role for like having "that presidential look" inspired Ronald Reagan to run for president?</UTT>That's hilarious that happened. Well, it was great talking with you. Have a good day.

It's tough to play tennis when the courts get wet but they want to use the helicopter to dry the grass after rain.</UTT>I heard they did that. Pretty genius if you ask me.</UTT>Yeah I agree. If you can believe it the longest match lasted 11 hours!</UTT>Yeah I believe it was played over the course of a few days.</UTT>That is amazing. A black man won the first U.S. Open title in 1968 and no black man has won it since.</UTT>Some people get kicked out for grunting too much. Some circles consider that cheating.</UTT>Yeah I think some people who think that is cheating are a bit ridiculous. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis. I didn't know that.</UTT>Did you ever play table tennis.</UTT>Yeah I really like that game. But I wouldn't want to play Gail Monfils.</UTT>I sure wouldn't either. I used to think it was called ping pong. How silly of me.</UTT>I don't think it is silly I definitely caught that as well. It's a fun form of entertainment. But I also like playing Nintendo. The original Nintendo entertainment system can only display 54 colors.</UTT>I love nintendo. I think super nintendo was better though.</UTT>Yeah maybe it was. I love playing donkey Kong. Around 50 BC they bred chickens for entertainment lol.</UTT>Thats cool. I think we have better stuff to do these days. Dont you.</UTT>Yeah for sure. I don't want to be playing with no chickens. I like watching movies. I never knew Ronald Reagan was an actor. Can't believe he got rejected from a role because he didn't look presidential.</UTT>Yeah I think he was in a few things before he became president.</UTT>I would like to see those movies. They should have them on Netflix. The original Nintendo entertainment system was finally discontinued in September 2003 in Japan. It had a great run.</UTT>It did have a great run. i know I bought a few of them over the years. Have a good one.

How about you?</UTT>I was a fan of the 70s show and days like these, but don't understand why it was cancelled after only ten episodes, was it because of the cast?</UTT>Not sure as to what the reason was there really. Maybe because in te UK humour is different. Do you ever watch SNL?</UTT>It probably is, I think the 70s show remade did ok in the UK. Yes, my favorite is the weekend update, it's hilarious! Are you a fan?</UTT>Yeah me too. I guess it is the longest running skit they have in the SNL</UTT>I could see why, it's witty, entertaining, and hilarious! I forget which of the Baldwin brothers does the Trump impersonation, but Alec Baldwin also narrated Thomas the Tank engine for at least 52 episodes! What a drastic change!</UTT>It is the same guy, Alec. He is so good at it too. That is a huge change for sure. DO you ever watch the Simpsons?</UTT>Oh so it is him! I used to watch it occasionally and I know it's wildly popular and successful but I never noticed the episode where Bart wasn't present, do you watch the Simpsons?</UTT>I do and I am not sure which episode that is. He wasn't even mentioned at least .</UTT>Yeah, I also didn't realize Pokemon was on for that long, there's at least 750 episodes! I thought Pokemon was something that was popular decades ago, but apparently not!</UTT>I think they have made a comeback with Pokemon Go and yeah they have been on air for 16 years. That is amazing</UTT>Oh yeah, that was very popular when it first came out, is it still that popular? I've only heard about it on the radio and never played, do you?</UTT>I have not played it either but I know it is all over. Back to hobbies, do you enjoy hockey?</UTT>I have never played hockey even though it snows a lot! Is hockey quite as big as it is in Canada where it's their national sport?</UTT>Yeah I think up there it is really popular. Did you hear the US Olympic team lost to an England high school team?</UTT>High schoolers losing to an Olympic team? Wow, that's kind of embarrassing, unless they let them win. there was a hockey player being traded for only $1 and he went on to win four stanley cups!</UTT>I guess that trade did not stop him from being a great player after all. Slovakian WOmen's team seems to be amazing to score a goal every 44 seconds</UTT>That's impressive, is there a difference between hockey and ice hockey as some countries refer?</UTT>I think they are the same thing. I know there is field hockey that does not involve ice, but those two should be the same thing</UTT>Oh ok, I think both sound really painful, especially when it's played on ice, an average professional player even loses up to eight pounds in one game!

I guess Stephen King considers that to be a horror movie!</UTT>I didnt, its weird considering King is one of the most renowned horror authors, I guess we all have our fears</UTT>haha ya maybe hes afraid of deer? I need to watch more horror movies you can burn almost 200 calories when watching one</UTT>Yeah lol, maybe he is and thats a great thing  I might pick the habit of watching horror films daily just to lose weight and get fit</UTT>haha you should come out with a weight loss book and that is teh secret! Also apparently you appreciate art more after watching a horror movie</UTT>Tthat is a strange fact indeed, have you ever seen a waterphone?</UTT>no but I heard about them, they make creepy noises, have you seen one?</UTT>No I also heard they are used in horror films, i wonder how they look like, did you watch The Shinning? its an classic horror film</UTT>oh ya I saw that, I was glad that kid in there didn't know he was making a horror movie at the time, he could have really be scarred</UTT>Yeah that could have created some serious scars, that sure is a sacary movie, do you use the internet a lot?</UTT>oh I use it all the time! my favorite button is the hamburger button, 3 horizontal lines, the name makes me hungry!</UTT>Its an interesting name indeed makes me hingry as well lol,  its a good thing the internet has a backup copy just in case.</UTT>ya It's housed in the Library of Alexandria, I wonder how much space that takes up and how often they take snapshots?</UTT>Im not sure but Im guessing it requires a lot of power and storage space,</UTT>oh definitely, also good to know that there is 3g service on mount everest, so that means I can use facebook at the summit!</UTT>It is a good thing, I would like to post an image if I made it to the top, it would be really sweet and unique</UTT>ya for sure, did you know you can get addicted to teh internet?

t_69e0d86a-6f51-4b24-8638-bbd28e3fc016</CONV>Hello! Do you enjoy mountain biking? Would you ever consider riding under power lines?</UTT>At times, your near power lines.  It is unavoidable in modern life.  I would not stay under them for a long time. A bike trail under them would not appeal to me.</UTT>Yeah it seems a bit crazy to me. In Maryland, they have created a six mile trail that follows the power lines.</UTT>Now, if this Dagnija Kreslins is supper annoying about people peeping in her windows, I might just go.  Six miles under a line... some times in the rain you can here them buzz.</UTT>Yeah that would be concerning. Do you enjoy running? Runners are going to use the trail because the dirt path is easier on their knees. I love running!</UTT>Not a runner.  It some times gets annoying to mix use a single track.  Cooperation with utilities seems a good idea.  Way to go Gretchen Bolton.  Nice T shirt.</UTT>What is your favorite mode of travel? The Dutch are currently creating a commuter bus that will travel at 160 mph...</UTT>Not sure I want to go 160 mph in a yellow bus and a cranky Dutch man at the wheel.  My favorite mode is motorcycle, no luggage, no plans, back at work in one week.</UTT>That does sound nice! I agree though, 160 mph is too fast. I prefer cars. In Iceland, there is no public rail system and people often fly between cities. I'm not a fan of flight.</UTT>I dont understand Japan.  That is easy to say.  $300 to travel across the country.  Seems like a lot.  Maybe flying is safer.</UTT>Yeah that's too expensive! I also enjoy walking, since it helps me get around and doesn't cost a thing. Did you know that putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes can remove odors?</UTT>I did know that.  Coffee grounds used or fresh works well too.  If you are walking along a ridge line, you are easy to see.  Walk about 3/4 from the bottom.  much stealthier.</UTT>Interesting! That is good information to know. I prefer to wear tennis shoes, because they are comfortable and I could take them on the Montgomery County trail.</UTT>Ever have a pair of shoes that you can not stand.  Just something wrong with them.  Turns out, 5000 year old shoes perform better in some respects than modern shoes.</UTT>I have. I wonder what makes those old shoes better. Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes in a week. That would be pricey!</UTT>I have never wanted to wear ballet shoes.  It looks painful.  One look at their feet and you will know.  People do odd things for fashion.  maybe modern shoes are too fashionable.</UTT>I'd agree with that. Fashion shoes are also too expensive. Some high fashion shoes can sell for thousands of dollars a pair.</UTT>$15 per pair sounds about right.  Way to go Stephon Marbury.</UTT>Yep that is the perfect amount to spend on shoes! I also think I could live in Hawaii, because the office business attire is the aloha shirt.</UTT>In Jamaica, it is a dress shirt and dress shorts.  with black socks and dress shoes. I have seen the layered look with popped collars before. Funny guys.</UTT>Wow that's quite the look! Well it was good talking to you. Enjoy your travels, however you chose to get there.</UTT>Hope your better than traveling with Billy Mays. Pallbearers with blue shirts and khaki pants.</UTT>That's an odd look
t_2db5c45b-8e55-4e1e-872d-17576ae625fd</CONV>Hello, do you follow tennis?</UTT>Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball.</UTT>Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis?</UTT>I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene "the crocodile" lacoste who was a famous player.</UTT>Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since.</UTT>Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open.</UTT>I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.</UTT>Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days. I bet they were exhausted!</UTT>That's crazy long!</UTT>I agree! It's amazing the facts you can find on Google. Did you know that a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon?</UTT>That's pretty amazing! I saw that Google maps calculates traffic by how fast Android devices are moving on the road.</UTT>I never knew that! I wonder whose? I know I heard that back in the day Google used goats to keep the lawn under control instead of hiring people to mow.</UTT>That's hilarious! Google went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the web traffic with it.</UTT>I can imagine. I use it a lot. It's hard to believe its only been around since 1998.</UTT>I agree. When there is a dispute on a border, Google maps tailors the map to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located.</UTT>That sounds logical. I wish I would have gotten on board with the 2004 initial public offering to buy stock. I can't even imagine the outcome.</UTT>I can't either. Do you like shoes?</UTT>I love shoes!! I know that shoes made 5000 years ago perform better than today's shoes!</UTT>That's pretty amazing they perform better than the shoes of today!</UTT>I agree. I can't see how though. I find it amazing the array of choices like ones that can cost thousands of dollars a pair.</UTT>It was good chatting with you!
t_8b7a5609-6237-41db-8b3a-d5e1828715b9</CONV>Hi, how are you?</UTT>I love to watch some good comedies on television.  Do you?</UTT>I do. What is your favorite comedy?</UTT>Friends and seinfeld were some of my favorites on NBC.</UTT>Those were good ones. I feel like Seinfeld holds up well but Friends, not so much... Did you watch the office?</UTT>I never watched the office but I did like Parks and Recreation.</UTT>I love that show too! It was so well written. So funny. I can lose a whole day watching that show.</UTT>Yes.  NBC seems to have a lot more dramas now like Chicago rather than comedies.</UTT>I do not think they can compete with Netflix's comedies or movies so they had to go dramas.</UTT>Yes they have Will and Grace on Thursdays but not much else</UTT>Is the reboot as good as the original? I really liked the original but havent seen the reboot.</UTT>I have not seen the reboot either but it got adopted for a new season.  NBC did have a bunch of failed comedy shows compared to the other networks.</UTT>They just picked up Brooklyn 99 so that's a new comedy they got! What other ones?</UTT>They have a backyard bar comedy called Abbys which is also new.</UTT>Really? Have you seen it or is it just a pilot at this point?</UTT>I have not seen it but it was picked up at midseason,</UTT>I will have to check it out. I had not heard of it. Do you watch shows like the voice?</UTT>I sometimes watch shows like the voice - they can definitely be interesting.  The Olympics definitely helped NBC get some good ratings as well.</UTT>I have only seen the voice like once. My wife watches it so I will get some of it but I dont watch those types of shows. I do love the olympics though!</UTT>Yes.  I do prefer comedy - I love bromantic comedies like Harold and Kumar and the hangover.</UTT>The first hangover was brilliant but the next two.. woah!</UTT>Yes.  And I agree with Bill Murray that the Kung Fu hustle was amazing in comedy!</UTT>I was shocked to learn that Jim Carrey no longer does dramas. He is talented but I feel he is a little off...</UTT>Yes he wants to do positive movies
t_af8ba21f-8b20-40c3-9f32-7c3d1a3ca706</CONV>Hello - how are you today?</UTT>I'm good!  Do you like to watch comedies?</UTT>I love comedy. Do you like them?</UTT>I'm a big fan!  Probably my favorite type of movie above the other genres.  Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since it's creation in 1989.  That's alot.</UTT>That's a ton! I saw that Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern age in comedy.</UTT>Hmmm...it must be funny then.  I've never seen it.  Have you?</UTT>I have not seen it yet either. I saw the Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy.</UTT>Yes.  I didn't know that.  It was also going to star Jack Black.  Did you remember 3rd Rock from the Sun?</UTT>I do remember 3rd Rock from the Sun. I didn't get to watch it too much though.</UTT>It was a funny show.  Corny comedy, but still good for a laugh.  It won a golden globe in 1997 for best comedy series.  Time sure is flying by.  Feels like that was yesterday.</UTT>That's interesting and definitely time flies by.</UTT>Did you ever see the movie Incredibles 2?</UTT>I have not yet. What about you?</UTT>I did.  I can't believe it's been 15 years already since the first one came out in 2004.</UTT>That's pretty crazy. I saw the movie is actually set in the 1960s.</UTT>I didn't know that.  How interesting!  The girl who designs the superhero costumes in the movie Edna is voiced by the director of the film Brad Bird.</UTT>That's very cool that it was the voice of Brad Bird.</UTT>I agree.  The girl who voices the character of Violet is Sarah Vowell.  She is also a political commentator and best selling author of historical nonfiction.  That's pretty neat!</UTT>That's really neat. I'll have to try and catch that movie soon. Sounds like it's pretty good.</UTT>It's a fun watch.  Especially if you like comedies.  I think anything Pixar has done is pretty good.</UTT>It was great talking to you!
t_00be5d53-2d70-47fe-9208-cf2c0867341b</CONV>do you know much about presidents?</UTT>I know some stuff. Do you know who the wealthiest three in the US are?</UTT>Yes that is JFK, Washington and Jefferson.</UTT>Yes. Do you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?</UTT>Yes he was called president Banana</UTT>Yeah. I wonder if that means something else in their language too</UTT>I wonder too. Did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?</UTT>I guess they get a lot of people there and need the room</UTT>Yeah I guess. Do you know how the VP used to be elected?</UTT>Yes that was the runner up that moved into that position</UTT>Yeah. Did you know the president of Indonesia is a pop star?</UTT>Yes and he has released three albums so far</UTT>Yesh what a guy. Do you like Nintendo?</UTT>I love it, too bad it was discontinued in 2003</UTT>Yes, it only had 54 colors but it was a lot of fun</UTT>Yeah I agree. Do you know who Bill Nye is?</UTT>Yes the science guy. You know how he got into entertainment?</UTT>Yes he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest</UTT>Yeah. Even Reagan once tried his hand at acting but did not go very well</UTT>Yes they said that he did not have the presidential look for the film</UTT>I guess he had the look to be a real president so that is okay with him I assume. Nice chat
t_9b762135-ef6f-4362-ab5d-aa6ad0e2cfc9</CONV>do you believe in climate change</UTT>I believe the climate is changing but not sure it's man-made.  Although Michael Mann from Penn State said Summer 2018 had extreme weather.  Not sure from what, though.  Do yoU?</UTT>I believe that it is man made</UTT>what causes you to think that?  there are so many different key diagnostic tools, even an earth 'x-ray' that shows climate change but not WHY it's changing.</UTT>The sea level is increasing and the ice keeps melting in the 2 poles of the earth</UTT>well ice melted during the ice age and there were no cars or smog or even the industrial age</UTT>I see.  But we did not exactly see what caused the melting, could be other earth's disasters that we did not know about</UTT>that's very true. scientists are really trying to develop more tools - sort of like MRI waves but for the earth.  I think that will help with this debate as to what's causing it</UTT>I think so.  Do you know that more than 80 % of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed</UTT>I didn't know that. How sad is that.  Is it from climate change? or those wildfires and such?</UTT>From human activities.  It is so sad</UTT>wow I had no idea. I know they blame heat, drought, wildfires, flooding and stores (hurricanes) all on climate change.</UTT>Also, do you know that when the earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long</UTT>I've never heard that before?  Why is it 24 hours now?  Can't be because of sun / night, right?   I know the earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun</UTT>I am not so sure, may be due to change in the earth's rotation in relative to the Sun and the Moon</UTT>that's interesting.  Did you know you could fit all the planets in between the earth and the moon and still have room left over?!</UTT>Never heard of that.  It is such a vast space</UTT>and the majority of Earth's polar regions are still covered in ice - wonder how climate change will affect the Antarctic and Arctic in the near future?</UTT>The areas of these regions will disappear drastically</UTT>that's sad.  do you really think so? I wish we could ensure that won't happen.</UTT>Yeah, people have been doing that.  Also, do you know that the earth will be free of helium by the end of the 21st century</UTT>no - is that also because of climate change? how will everything adapt to that?!</UTT>I have no idea.  I am wondering where will helium go?</UTT>this has been so interesting.  I hope we can still try to enjoy our Christmas, even with all this doom and gloom!  Thanks for talking with me!</UTT>nice chatting with you</UTT>Have a Merry Christmas - you've given me great conversation starters!

Can you play the piano?</UTT>I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room.</UTT>Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio?</UTT>That's really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930.</UTT>I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that.</UTT>Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days.</UTT>I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays</UTT>Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day!</UTT>That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.</UTT>I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built.</UTT>That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time.</UTT>So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them.</UTT>I dont think I could own one, but Im not scared or anything.  Did you know there are No Snakes in New Zealand.</UTT>Yeah that's pretty crazy. The only bad thing about owning a snake is the upkeep, it can get expensive.</UTT>I bet, is your snake one of the ones that flies?</UTT>Haha no, king snakes can not do that, if they could I am not sure I would want to own one, they sound very dangerous.</UTT>Where I live a giant cobra escaped and was loose in the city.</UTT>Well I hope someone caught it before someone killed it, You cant punish them for doing what is hard wired into them.</UTT>They never found it.  Dead or alive.  Yeah, I have a friend who is seriously afraid of snakes, runs away from the smallest ones.</UTT>I don't have a fear of snakes, but spiders on the other hand I almost can not stand them to even be near me, hate the little buggers.</UTT>Small ones dont bother me but once they get past a certain size thats a big nope from me.  Roaches freak me out.</UTT>Haha yeah roaches are just down right nasty, any way good chatting with you.</UTT>Same here have a good day!
t_ddb72c3d-6b34-4443-9601-b9998ea7f8c5</CONV>I used to dance back in the day. I love it. Did you know babies dance spontaneous when they hear music?</UTT>It's a natural reaction.  All cultures have dance.</UTT>I heard that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?  Seriously, he won the hong kong cha-cha challenge. Who do you think is a great dancer?</UTT>Dance and formal martial arts have a lot in common, so it doesn't surprise me that Bruce Lee was a good dancer.</UTT>Tupac danced ballet! I can't even imagine!</UTT>You asked who I think is a good dancer.  There is Michael Jackson, who even patented a device to help with his dance moves.</UTT>Yes, love me some MJ. I have a friend's daughter that does ballet. They say a pro ballet dance can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. I thought they had to work them in.</UTT>Ballet uses choreography, which is one way dance can be characterized.</UTT>So did you watch the super bowl or have any fantasy drafts? Did you know that people fantasy draft the national spelling bee?</UTT>There is a fantasy Congress, too.  Seems like there are fantasy leagues for everything.</UTT>Yep. Crazy. I want to be a part of the Fantasy Congress!</UTT>It turns out that that a single fold in your brain separates perception of fantasy vs. reality.</UTT>Can't believe that! Do you like science and the solar system?</UTT>Very much.  Something most people don't know is that the sun is white, and is perceived as yellow because of the atmosphere</UTT>and it is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star. Space amazes me.</UTT>If we could harness all the sun's energy, we would have enough in one second to meet the needs of the earth for 500,000 years.</UTT>Yep. Speaking of energy, my friend's mom got hit by lightning and died. Did you know a bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun. 5x as hot</UTT>I don't doubt that lightning is very hot.  It sets many things on fire where it hits.</UTT>It is really powerful.I hate lightening but the sun provides so much. It provides energy in one second that will meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years</UTT>The sun accounts for well over 99% of solar system mass and it's burning full tilt, so it's not surprising that it is creating that much energy.</UTT>good talking to you.</UTT>Time to see what sun is left for today.

He seemed realistic.</UTT>He was one of my favorite character as well, why is he green though? ive always wondered that</UTT>Don't know.  He was once orange though.  I didn't realize Jim Henson created Sesame Street.  I knew he did muppets.</UTT>Did you ever follow Caroll Spinney?</UTT>Until now, I'd never heard of him.  I guess he created Oscar with a heart so he can't be all bad.</UTT>Well Caroll spiney was Big Bird and also Oscar the Grouch, he announced his retirement I think thats kind of sad, I grew up watching the show</UTT>That is sad.  In Turkey Oscar is called Kirpik and he lives in a basket.</UTT>Thats odd lol, do you watch a lot of tv?</UTT>About average I guess.  I liked the Simpsons.  Only one of their many episode didn't have Bart or no mention of him.</UTT>I didnt catch that episode, Bart is my favorite character though</UTT>Mine's Homer... Did you know the Dodo bird is in the pigeon family?  Imagine the mess around a park bench...</UTT>Isnt the Dodo bird extinct now? and it would be messy I agree</UTT>Yes.  Some birds bones weigh less than their feathers.</UTT>Wow they do, I guess that why they can fly, some birds fly really long distances without sleeping</UTT>Birds in Australia can mimic the sounds of chainsaws and car alarms.</UTT>I think they have serious identity issues lol, that would be fun to listen at</UTT>Did you know it's legal in S. Africa to have a flame-thrower on your car?</UTT>No I didnt know that,  why would they allow a thing like that? thank God they arent legal in America</UTT>To prevent carjacking.  I prefer McDonald's where the drive thru was invented to help soldiers.</UTT>That seems excessive, and McDonalds had a great idea, I bet that lifted sales and now every fast food chain has it</UTT>Yep.

She also removed her music from Spotify</UTT>Yes because she thinks music should not be free</UTT>Yeah I guess. She sometimes walks backwards so they cannot take her picture</UTT>Wow. DO you know much about the earth?</UTT>I know that we have sadly destroyed 80% of the forests</UTT>Yeah. Did you know the day used to have only 5.5 hours?</UTT>Yeah. Do you believe in extraterrestrials?</UTT>I do and the UN has now assigned an ambassador just in case they show up</UTT>Yeah. Earth is predicted to be helium free by the end of the century</UTT>Yeah I guess no more fun balloons and funny voices for us</UTT>I guess not. Did you know that we represent only 1 minute and 17 seconds in the history of earth if it were 24 hours?</UTT>Wow and yet we have done so much to this planet so far</UTT>I know.

t_cbfce7fa-edcd-4a3a-9db9-24723beeb0bc</CONV>Did you hear that Mark E Smith, of the band of the Fall died at age 60?</UTT>Oh thats too bad, I used to love his music, he sure was a visionary leader.</UTT>He was a punk rocker?  What other similar musicians do you like?</UTT>I like Eddie Van Halen, I think he has some sweet solos, like the one of the song Beat It, what about you?</UTT>I don't know my rock categories very well.  I like Queen and Aerosmith.  The Fall had over 60 different members during their 40 year existence.</UTT>Do you like the song "Repetition" its one of my favorites of the Fallen and also one of their earliest songs.</UTT>Yes.  That may be the only one I know.  The band was considered the pinnacle of underground rock.  That is like being on top of an anthill.</UTT>What I liked about the group is that they had like this classical touch kind of like the Beatles.</UTT>That is true for a select group of fans.  There are lots of albums available today.</UTT>Do you know how many albums the group has?</UTT>I believe it is 65.  There were many Facebook posts following his death and many different songs were cited as favorites.</UTT>Oh a lot of albums them I might search for a couple on Spotify, and do you have a Facebook account?</UTT>Yes.  My wife has more friends that me however.  I know that the color blue is used a lot on Facebook because Zuckerberg is red-green color blind.</UTT>Oh I thought it was because blue looks cool or because it attracts people, thats inresting to know though, cool fact!!</UTT>Yes.  There are sometimes strange causes for things in our life.  Netflix was started because a guy was mad at a $40 late fee at Blockbuster.  Burger King had a promotion where one got a free whopper for unfriending 10 people on Facebook.</UTT>I remember that promotion, I actually took advantage of it and received a free whooper, and I get you, Iceland really took it to another level though.</UTT>What did Iceland do?</UTT>Ok so appartently Iceland is basically rewritting their constitution using feedback via Facebook.</UTT>That is unique!  You mentioned Van Halen earlier.  Did you know that he set the studio speakers on fire when recording his guitar solo for "Beat It"?</UTT>I didnt know that Ive always liked that solo but didnt know his guitar got on fire!! thats crazy!</UTT>Not the guitar, the speakers.  I am sure the power at volume created the heat.  I am going to go now.  Enjoyed talking with you!

I know that the front man of Muse used his iPhone to record his unborn child's heartbeat and then used it in a song. That's pretty interesting.</UTT>Wow, he must have a very unique way of viewing the world as an artist. Did you know that when microsoft launched its own line of phones, they held a funeral for the death of the iphone? Lol</UTT>Wow, that was presumptuous. Both companies can do strange things. Jobs had to switch phones secretly during a presentation because they would run out of ram and crash.</UTT>Another funny fact is there is actually a iphone game called send me to heaven that creators developed to encourage people to shatter as many iphones as possible by seeing how high they can toss their phone into the air. It was banned by apple since it encouraged behavior that would damage the user's devices</UTT>Wow, I can't imagine why people would have used the app. Some common sense should be used. There are plenty of other apps to choose from. As of January 2017 there were 2.2 million apps on the app store.</UTT>Not to mentioned that iPhone is like a small laptop and camera all in one device that can fit in your hand to take photos, play music, send and receive emails, and browse the web</UTT>They are pretty amazing. Do you like horror films? I love them.</UTT>I do love horror</UTT>Yay! The boy who played Danny in The Shining did not know they were filming a horror movie. That's probably good given how intense that movie is.</UTT>I guess that would allow him to show genuine reactions that were captured perfectly on film. I think horror films are interesting since it has very interesting visuals and watching it can help burn 180 plus calories.</UTT>I had heard that it burned calories. How fascinating. Do you enjoy Stephen King?</UTT>I personally haven't watch him much. But I have seen many reference in pop culture to him such in Gravity falls. I also read that the first horror film he saw was bambi.</UTT>That is correct. It terrified him as a child and as a result we have many great works.</UTT>I mean horror in general were inspired by many brilliant minds like Edgar Allan Poe or Mary Shelley. Do you prefer horror in a realistic slice of life setting or a more supernatural, fantasy setting?</UTT>I really enjoy both but I probably lean a little more towards realistic. And I really enjoy Poe and Shelley's Frankenstein. Did you know that if you watch a horror movie before looking at abstract art you will appreciate it more?</UTT>I wonder why. Did you know Frankenstein isn't the name of the monster, but actually the mad scientist?</UTT>I did indeed. Such a good book. Have you ever heard of a waterphone?</UTT>I recently read they are the instrument that makes those creepy sound signature to horror flicks. I mean it is amazing there are instruments that I never knew existed but are so prevalent in daily life.</UTT>That is correct.
t_30eb58f7-6981-49c5-8600-bcf588811b1f</CONV>Hi, do you listen to music?</UTT>Yes I love all types of music, One of my favorite things to do is to listen to the radio in my car and sing along. How about you?</UTT>Nice me too. Did you ever manage to catch Jupiter's storms on am?</UTT>No that is crazy that sounds can be heard from that far. I wonder if sound can do more than people think like change our moods and thoughts. I wonder if the Jupiter storm could effect us.</UTT>Hmmm good point. Do you listen to Canadian radio?</UTT>No Since I am in america but I have heard that in Canada 40 percent of the music must be from canadian artists. I love the rap music they play on the radio. Have you ever heard of Tupac?</UTT>Yes , his music is in the library of congress, that is how important the guy was</UTT>Rap music has come a long way since just being poetry. It is even big in korea where they made a new kind of rap called freestyle battle. Do you still buy CDs or albums?</UTT>I buy them from time to time, the digital versions. How about you? Do you have a favorite one?</UTT>I am a big fan of rock music like Linkin Park. I think their cd called Hybrid theory is the best selling cd of the 21st century. Have you ever used cassettes?</UTT>I have actually and I love that album, they are so great</UTT>It is amazing how people love music. I heard that two 100 year old twins made a rap cd in Japan. Do you like rap more than rock?</UTT>Hmm not not really I still like rock better/ Have you heard of Reel Big Fish?</UTT>I have heard a greatest hits album by them and I thought it was good. I like old school rap better than todays rap, Have you ever heard NWA?</UTT>Yeah they had the first album to reach platinum without advertising it</UTT>Yea I think its cause they were unique and actually had some rapping skill. Have you ever heard of eminem? I think he is the best rapper</UTT>I like him too. Did you know he originally wanted to be a comic book artist?</UTT>Yea I heard he was a big fan of Spider man, Kinda weird cause his music is not so friendly. I remember some radio stations did not want to play his music.</UTT>Yeah, go figure. Do you know Busta Rhymes?</UTT>Yea he is that rapper that is known for rapping really fast. I heard he even was on the kids shows rugrats as a voice. I think we should promote happy and positive rap music</UTT>I totally agree with that because I believe that way it can also be educational. Nice chatting with you :)

Did you know stephen king was terrified of the movie Bambi?</UTT>Yeah i heard that, it was considered his first horror film, lol. I'm not sure how Nolan meant for Inception to be a horror film. Did you see it?</UTT>Maybe a mental horror films,  I can definitely see how being lost in your own mind or dreams can be scary.  By the way that was an amazing movie!</UTT>Yes an amazing movie. Have you ever seen phineas and ferb?</UTT>No i havent.  What is that?</UTT>Well apparently the writer of the old Rocky Horror Show pictures is the voice of the dad on that show.</UTT>Ok,  thats cool.  I hear that you can burn up to 180 calories by watching horror movies!</UTT>Not a good enough reason to watch, but thanks. You know the first international Olympic game was held in the year 1896.</UTT>Oh I am not convincing you to watch horror movies.  I just recently read some interesting facts that I thought were cool,  just thought I would share.  No,  I didnt know that about the olympics.  did you know the kid from the shining didnt even know they were shooting a horror film lol</UTT>I heard that he didn't find out until years later, that's wow. Yeah but back then the most successful competitors were, Germany's carl schuhmann, he won 4 golds.</UTT>Oh,  in what?</UTT>Gymnastics and Wrestling, I think he also competed in Weightlifting, the long jump and shot put.</UTT>That is interesting.  Do you like Gymnastics and wrestling?</UTT>I like them both maybe gymnastics a little more. Apparently the ancient Greeks practiced in order for war. Can imagine war being averted because of a wrestling match.</UTT>I thought they practiced to prepare themselves for war.  What do you mean a wrestling match?  I read recently that an american with a wooden leg won 6 medals in gymnastics.</UTT>Wow that's amazing!! I was just trying to be funny about the wrestling match to end the war. You know part of gymnastics included skills for mounting a horse and dismounting.</UTT>Oh ok lol I guess I just didnt get it. Yeah that seems hard.  Have you ever tried?</UTT>Wrestling or mounting horses? I've done a little of both.</UTT>The gymnastics mounting and dismounting.  Its been great talking to you,  have a good one.
t_3ce5e714-174c-42df-bbb7-e808a6b61d2e</CONV>every us president with a beard has been a republican, that's odd.</UTT>That is odd. So what do you think of trump.</UTT>I like trump</UTT>Me too. I think he needs to calm down a little bit sometimes but he is a smart dude.</UTT>yeah I never liked trump before he was president. I think he's doing a great job with all that he's been dealt.</UTT>Trump is a republican. Did you know there hasnt been a president who wasnt a republican or democrat since 1853</UTT>You think it's true that the last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928? How can that be?</UTT>It doesnt sound right to me either.</UTT>funny about harry truman not wanting to be photo'd on the dumbo ride because he didn't want to be associated with repubs.</UTT>They was taking shots at each other even back then huh.</UTT>yeah looks like it. Some things never change.</UTT>consistent use of red and blue for the parties only started in 2000.</UTT>yeah looking at the red blue map, looks like most blue is on the coasts and the red is in the middle.</UTT>Yeah. I wonder why that is.</UTT>seems like the bigger cities are more blue.</UTT>I guess that makes a little bit of sense.</UTT>86% of nevada owned by the government?</UTT>i believe it. Nevada is mostly desert, so who else would want it.</UTT>true! who would want it? guess it's good for nuclear testing. ;)</UTT>Well if thats what they are doing out there Im guessing wikileaks will let us know.</UTT>yeah, maybe wikileaks can let us know about space aliens in area 51 too.</UTT>Well they published the governments plans to destroy wikileaks so Im sure they would have no problem leaking it. Lol.</UTT>heard assange was offered an australian passport, I always thought he was european</UTT>Yeah I did too. Well its been a good chat. I gotta get off here.
t_f432a6b4-9046-48e2-80fc-3f109498227b</CONV>I love pop music is makes me want to dance, How about you?</UTT>Hello there, I do like pop music, but not all songs.</UTT>I am a big fan of all music, I love driving my car and blasting music out my radio. Have you ever heard of the car brand Cadillac?</UTT>That is fun I will say.  And yeah I have why?</UTT>It my favorite car, Did you know that the brand was named after a french explorer who founded Detroit. Have you ever seen a Model T?</UTT>That is really cool, I didn't know that.  Yeah I have, Ford right?</UTT>Yes it was made by ford in 1908, I think in 1886 the Benz motorwagen was invented. Have you owned lots of cars?</UTT>Yeah you are right, Benz by Karl Benz way back then.  No, I have only owned two, how about you?</UTT>I have owned 3 cars, One of my favorites was my jeep. I loved going to drive in theaters with my family. My kids love musicals, Have you seen any good ones?</UTT>Those used to be fun to go to when I was younger.  No, I have never been to an actual musical that wasn't a family members.</UTT>I remember one time we were at the drive ins and we heard a weird noise coming from the radio, My sister said that she heard you can hear Jupiter from your radio. I wonder if that is true?</UTT>Yeah I have read that before, you can supposedly hear large storms from Jupiter on an am radio.</UTT>Its crazy what you can pick up with sound wave and how simple it can be done. In wwii soldiers made radios with razorblades and pencils</UTT>That is true, and that is so amazing they were able to do that, I'm sure any little bit of entertainment helped.</UTT>People are very easily entertained, especially with music. Music is loved by the whole world, Did you know that the President of indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?</UTT>I have read that before, I wonder how bad or good they are.  I do bet they have sold really well though.</UTT>Music always does well, In North Korea there is a girl band that is really popular. I think pop music is accepted in most places. Do you like girl bands?</UTT>Yeah I like some girl bands, but they are mostly really old music.  How about you?</UTT>I like rock music more but I do like the fact that United states created pop in the 1950s</UTT>Yeah that is a cool fact, I like a lot of the music from the 50's from the US.</UTT>I have never heard music that old but I do like Ricky Gervais pop music from the 80s</UTT>That is interesting stuff for sure, well it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night.</UTT>You also have a good night and cherish your pop music and car radios</UTT>Thanks you too.
t_cfd29767-4123-4ba5-bbeb-36aa1cdda172</CONV>HI how are you?</UTT>Im great, do you like fiction?</UTT>I do for the most part. What about you?</UTT>I like it, George RR Martin is one of my favorite writters</UTT>It is funny that he despised fan fiction and says it is copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring actors.</UTT>I have to disagree with him there, a lot of fan fictions are actually pretty good</UTT>I agree with you. It is messed up that a judge in 1950 tried banning a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.</UTT>Thats racist, I hope that judge got sanctioned,</UTT>I also hope that. Do you like Dramas?</UTT>I like them one of my favorite shows is House, have you seen it before?</UTT>I think I watched like one episode before.</UTT>I see, well do you remember Hugh Laurie? the leading actor, the one that has a limp?</UTT>I do vaguely. He is the highest paid actor ever for a tv drama right?</UTT>He is he makes about $700,000 per episode, maybe a bit more now</UTT>Must be nice! Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?</UTT>No, did he had a calling since he was a little kid? I have no idea really</UTT>All the prettiest girls in his high school were in Drama class!</UTT>I see, well, clearly the decision led to a successful career path.</UTT>True! I love how Jim Carey does not make dramas anymore because of his belief system.</UTT>I respect that, Jim Carey is a great actor and positivity is a great emotion to share and experience with others</UTT>I also respect that. I agree with him that movies should project positivity more.</UTT>We should all be more like Jim Carey, have a positive mindset and dont let negativity affect us either way I hope you have a great night, its been great chatting</UTT>Thanks! Nice chatting with you as well!

Do you have a favorite singer?</UTT>I love the band Linkin Park and you?</UTT>Me too actually and they have the best selling album of the century</UTT>Yeah Hybrid Theory was a huge success for them indeed</UTT>Yeah. Have you heard of Reel  Big Fish?</UTT>I have, they had to rerecord their hits because lots the rights to them</UTT>WOw what dedication. Twins in their 100s in Japan released an album in 1992</UTT>WOw impressive. Do you like dance?</UTT>I love it, Bruce Lee used to be a dancer too in cha-cha</UTT>Nice and Tupac was one too but in ballet</UTT>Nice one and he stared in a production of the nutcracker too</UTT>WOw the guy is just everywhere whether it be music or dance</UTT>Yeah true, Babies are also good at dancing as soon as they hear music</UTT>Yeah and smile more when they hit the beat</UTT>Yeah pretty smart and in sync with the music</UTT>Yeah that is true. do you use the internet much</UTT>I use it a lot actually. Do you know what the hamburger button is?</UTT>Yes that would be the thee horizontal line menu</UTT>Yeah. Did you know you can develop addiction by clicking too much?</UTT>Yeah I can see that, anything too much can lead to that
t_fac5b20c-fea6-4d53-8c8f-59b60232f8c5</CONV>Hi! Are you an Amazon Prime member?</UTT>Hello - yes I am. Are you?</UTT>Absolutely!  I have been doing business with Amazon almost as long as it has been around back in 1994.</UTT>Very good. Bezos build a clock into a mountain that can run for 10,000 years.</UTT>Nice. Is that to keep their shipments on time?  They use USPS on Sundays and they could use all the help they can get!</UTT>I love the shipments on Sunday's. I wonder if those workers get overtime for that?</UTT>Who knows?  The workers I worry about are all those warehouse workers who walk 15 miles every day!</UTT>That's a lot of walking. I saw Amazon also owns IMDB.</UTT>Yeah. Since 1998. I don't know when IMDB started streaming movies on Freedive though...</UTT>Interesting...Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Of course. I would have to be from Jupiter to not listen to radio, and even then, electromagnetic storms from Jupiter are so strong, they can be detected using AM radio on earth!</UTT>I would love to hear that. In Canada, all radio stations must play 40% of the Canadian music. Weird law I think.</UTT>They have a strong beaver lobby... But at least it does not apply to internet radio!  There is an internet site where you can listen to classic radio dramas. Have you heard it?</UTT>I have not heard of it. I would like to find it though. Soldiers in WWII made radios using pencils and razorblades.</UTT>If you use a pink pencil, you automaticallly tune to a Taylor Swift song...  But don't use a charcoal pencil. Then you recieve transmissions from a Finnish station that broadcasts news in classical Latin.</UTT>HAHA. Do you follow government?</UTT>I have learned to never follow after elephants and donkeys...or at least not without a shovel!</UTT>Haha. The government owns 86% of the land in Nevada.</UTT>Yeah, and the also wasted money buying the Eiffel Tower from a French dude impersonating a representative of the French government.  The best and the brightest...</UTT>That's hilarious! I can't imagine doing that.</UTT>Well, imagine you are the Norwegian government, and you just spent $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest ... Now they have to decide where they are going to store it...</UTT>That's pretty awesome they did that. It was good chatting with you today. Take care.
t_f33dc23b-bad1-4a2e-ac1d-1d8f68883541</CONV>Hello, how are you today? What are your interests?</UTT>Hey there, I was so impressed with Aretha Franklin version of Amazing Grace. The sound was glorious and an epic moment.</UTT>You like music? Did you know  in 1972 that Pink Floyd recorded a live concert in an ancient Roman amphitheater in Pompeii without an audience?</UTT>Oh man, that is super cool. I love Pink Floyd. Wow, and even in Pompeii!</UTT>Me too! It is pretty cool. There is still a Roman amphitheater still in use today in Croatia.</UTT>That is amazing. I was a big fan of Creed but heard that they were actually sued for a band concert. I never saw them in person and I am sorta glad about it. Have you seen them?</UTT>Wow that is terrible. Some artist these days are pretty terrible live. They need the auto tune and whatever else they use to make them sound better recorded.</UTT>Yeah, that is a very good point. It must have been horrible to be sued for the performance. I saw the Ramones over 20 years ago and they played  2,263 concerts non stop for 20 years.</UTT>That's a crazy amount of concerts. i saw linkin park back in 2001 they performed 324 concerts that year alone.</UTT>Wow, they are super human. I relaly like the Oscars too. I think Daniel Day Lewis has won before. I really like him, hes my favorite actor.</UTT>Did you know that Walt Disney still holds the record for the most oscars won by a man, he won 22.</UTT>Noway! Thats crazy, I never knew that! My parents like Blazing Saddles, do you know if they ever won any awards.</UTT>Eminem has more oscars than Leonardo Decaprio, Johnny Depp, Will Smith, George Lucas and Bill Murry combined!</UTT>Man, that's a weird fact, huh. I watched the time that Jimmy Kimmel hosted because he is so funny and able to handle a big show like the Academy Awards.</UTT>I like when a comedian is the host. Another fact the oscars were nominated for 9 Emmy's in 2013 alone.</UTT>The awards they hand out are 24 different awards too , by the way.</UTT>I wasn't aware of that. Off topic but another interesting fact. Did you know that MdDonalds' added drive-thru's in 1975 for soldiers whom were not allowed to get ou tof vehicles in their fatigues.</UTT>Oh that s cool. I like that!! My kids are in the Navy!</UTT>Did you know that in South Africa is is legal to equip your car with flame-throwers to stop carjcking?</UTT>NOway, thats nuts! I did know that Jann Mardenborough became a pro driver based on learning how to drive from a video game. Wild, huh?</UTT>Interesting. Did you know that Cadillac is named after the founder of Detroit? French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac.</UTT>That is a super fun fact, cool!</UTT>It was nice chatting with you today!
t_94db863e-3006-436f-b441-6b65937d610c</CONV>Hey there. I heard that Laura Ingraham is being sued. Did you hear that yet?</UTT>Yeah, I heard that Laura was very demanding and when her assistant got pregnant she was fired.</UTT>Exactly! I guess that the assistant was having her first child which is also a factor in the lawsuit. I guess the poor girl had to work 7 days a week most of the time.</UTT>Yes, this does seem like a good case of pregnancy discrimination under FMLA and her district's Protecting Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.</UTT>Yes, it sounds legit to me too. Karolina Wilson stated that Laura Ingraham was not easily satisfied but that she was always happy with Ms. Wilson's work.</UTT>But Ingraham did let Wilson stay with the company for three weeks so she could get unemployment insurance. Hopefully this isn't just a case of a disgruntled worker who happened to be pregnant. What do you think?</UTT>Hmm? That is a valid point. The report states that Ms. Wilson was also angry about the inability to have a private area to pump breast milk for her child.</UTT>The company denies that Wilson was ever an efficient worker.</UTT>Oh, that changes things for sure. I am not sure that I see Laura Ingraham keeping an assistant more than a day whom she was not happy with.</UTT>That is true. It's tricky because it seems it's mostly one person's word against another.</UTT>Yes, I totally agree! Laura Ingraham's company has less than 20 employees so I think the law changes for smaller companies also.</UTT>Apparently Ingraham gave Wilson assignments on the day she was going into labor. There may be proof in text.</UTT>Yes, I agree!</UTT>But who knows, maybe her replacement is actually a better worker.</UTT>Yeah, that is America. We support fairness! I was eating lunch and remembering that Mcdonalds added drive-thru's to accommodate soldiers in 1975 who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing fatigues. Thats fair!</UTT>Sure is! Too bad the drive thrus kind of backfired and made a lot of Americans very lazy, haha</UTT>HA! That is pretty true! Great point! All those hamburgers did not help obesity.</UTT>Yeah, maybe we have to go back to the time before cars. It's surprising to believe that cars were just available to the masses only a little over a century ago. Before that most people walked and took animal drawn carriages and carts.</UTT>Yeah, that is amazing! Well, it is almost like rotary phones that dialed 212 area code the fastest.</UTT>I had one of those when I was little. I think it was after its time but my parents were too cheap to replace it.</UTT>That is a funny memory! Great!</UTT>Yeah, I even remember using the phonebook. Did you know it's impossible to separate two phonebooks that have their pages overlapped?
t_6b13a7ef-d760-402a-9b3c-4d64f83ecd2d</CONV>Hello do you like rap music?</UTT>I like Korean freestyle complement battle. You?</UTT>I have never seen or heard it but it sounds interesting. I like rap sometimes</UTT>I didn't know that Eminem dreamed of one day becoming a comic book artist. How do you like that street cred?</UTT>Yeah that is pretty cool. DO you like Tupac?</UTT>Ah, the artist listed in the library of congress under "cultural significance" is a mystery to me.</UTT>Yeah, I guess it was powerful music. A judge in Michigan gave the ruling in the forms of rap because it was a suit against Eminem</UTT>Nice...   Rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular...When it's put to music it can be spectacular.  Uh huh.</UTT>Yeah pretty awesome. On another topic, do you know much about presidents?</UTT>Yeah. The Pres of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office.</UTT>Yeah I wonder if he is any good or if people listen to his music just because he is the president</UTT>Yeah, maybe they call him "President Banana" behind his back, like they called the first Pres of Zimbabwe?</UTT>Haha good point, maybe they do. DO you know much Obama?</UTT>Unfortunately, yes. When he visited India, they removed all the coconuts from around his destination.</UTT>Hmm interesting one. If you zoom in on Google Maps in the white house, you can see him there</UTT>While in office, FDR vetoed 635 bills during his presidency. Obama vetoed 2.</UTT>Yeah that is a huge difference. Do you know what his secret service codename was?</UTT>B.O.?</UTT>It was actually renegade, not sure who came with it though</UTT>It wopuld have been fun if the old rules were in place when BO ran for the president...the one where the runner up automatically gets to be VP.  Then Romney would have had to be Obama's flunky.</UTT>Yeah that is an interesting rule they had then. It was nice chatting with you.
t_8a7c2fbf-c314-4903-abab-232163c0aa3d</CONV>I think it's interesting that in basketball, the teams will try to neutralize one best player, which is sometimes LeBron James, the Boston Celtics are actually researching it right now</UTT>I heard about "Defending LeBron James 101", do you know what it is?</UTT>I don't know what it is exactly, but I know they're trying to make sure that he is not a big part of a game when he plays, it makes sense though and I wish them luck but I think he's just too good</UTT>Do you watch NBA games on TV or live?</UTT>Well I like to watch NBA games on TV actually, I've never been to one in real life, what about you?</UTT>I watch them on tv with my adult son.  He likes them more than I do.  I understand that the league has 30 teams.</UTT>If they do, 29 in the United States and only one in Canada, the one in Canada is the Toronto Raptors I believe</UTT>That was interesting that there was one team in Canada.  I thought that all were within the US.</UTT>Yep just one team in Canada, what do you think about shooting granny style by the way? Apparently scientists say it's the best and most consistent way to shoot a basketball</UTT>Apparently NBA players avoid doing it because, according to them, it looks stupid.</UTT>But if I were paid $800,000 a year like Allen Iverson, I would shoot however is the best way LOL even if it looks stupid</UTT>I totally agree with you.  Tim Duncan decided to finish college instead of going directly to the NBA after high school.</UTT>Yeah that's interesting, he definitely lost money by doing that, interesting too that originally Air Jordans were banned by the NBA</UTT>About Tim,  I would be afraid that the offer would not be available after graduation.  Also, I heard about Air Jordans and the ban.</UTT>Yeah it's shocking that they were fining Michael Jordan, and so Michael Jordan asks Nike and Nike just paid the fine so he could keep wearing the shoes LOL</UTT>I'm sure Nike did not lose money by doing that - it might be the contrary.</UTT>I don't know they probably need money because of the Genius Bar LOL. What do you think about LeBron James? he's probably going to make a lot of money for being in the new Space Jam movie</UTT>Is that a sequel?  If it is, who was the main actor on the original one?</UTT>Yes it is a sequel. The original actor was Michael Jordan, I bet he will have a cameo in it though</UTT>I see.  Thank you for the infor.  Lebron James is a good person.  He raised 6 M dollars for charity.</UTT>Yeah he seems like a nice guy. He also rejected an offer from Reebok for 10 million dollars, only to one year later accept an offer from Nike for 90 million, he's apparently a business genius
t_63376536-b4d2-4ce4-b53b-a48522c5457a</CONV>The Patriots are a real power house team in the NFL.</UTT>They no longer play in Boston anymore.  They are based in Foxborough.</UTT>Yes, I knew they no longer played in the Boston area. It seems like almost a given that the Patriots will be in the Super Bowl or the playoffs ever year.</UTT>They have been there so many time that they have lost four times, as many as the Bills.</UTT>I'm normally not a big Tom Brady fan. But, I might have to change my opinion about him, since he came out of the Big Ten.</UTT>He didn't seem that good when he was playing with Michigan.  Who knew?</UTT>I don't remember him playing with Michigan actually.</UTT>As good as Brady is, his wife makes twice as much money as he does.</UTT>That's funny, isn't it? She owns hotels and some apparel lines, too.</UTT>When Brady was on his JV high school team, he didn't even get a start even though the team was winless.</UTT>At Michigan, he was the backup quarterback, and he even had to fight for his starting spot, too. I wonder what pushed him over the top.</UTT>Maybe it's because he has never eaten a strawberry.</UTT>LOL! Maybe strawberries are his cryptonite!</UTT>He and coach Belichick together have won five Super Bowls, that's a lot.</UTT>It is a lot. He has been to the Super Bowl eight times. I wonder if the Patriots will make it again this year.</UTT>If Brady wins one more, he will break the tie with Charles Haley for most Super Bowl wins.</UTT>That's awesome. Maybe that is the reason Tom Brady is waiting to retire.</UTT>When he does, he has his supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen to go home to.  Not a bad way to retire.</UTT>Nope. And, I'm sure he will be doing a bunch of commercials and spots like Peyton Manning.</UTT>Or maybe he can master video games and become as good as Baker Mayfield</UTT>That could be! It's been fun chatting with you!

Even with giving up half his stuff, he'll still be in the top 10 richest list...</UTT>And his ex wife will be up there too.  He Founded Amazon in 1994.  It doesn't feel like that long ago.</UTT>The first amazon.com customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him. I wish I had a building named after me...</UTT>I just wish I had 1% of his fortune.  And it's crazy to think that Alibaba Group is even larger.</UTT>I know. I wanted to buy into Amazon at like $500 per share and now it's at like $1800. I kick myself everytime I am looking at the ticker and it comes up. I did get Alibaba early in that process....</UTT>That was a smart move.  I try to buy on the dips as well, but Amazon is so expensive.  Did you know their warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day?</UTT>I worked at Office Max warehouse and I believe it. The worst part is the summers when there's no air and you're just sweating! Amazon ceo jeff bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years.</UTT>If he has that kind of money, you'd think he's finalize his own delivery fleet.  As of now he has the USPS delivering for him on Sundays.</UTT>Yeah... He has enough to buy IMDB. I had no clue...</UTT>They sell everything:  toys, electronics, furniture, food, jewelry.  I even bought a big screen tv from them.</UTT>Did you really buy a TV from them? White glove service too?</UTT>Yup, 65 inch Samsung.  Pretty sweet set.  They brought it in, unwrapped it, put it on the stand, and took away the packaging...  They also sell low-end products under the name Amazon Basics.</UTT>I was going to order a TV from them but got cold feet and didn't pull the trigger. I do like their Basic stuff... In 2015, Amazon surpassed Walmart as the most valuable retailer in the United States by market capitalization. Amazon is the third most valuable public company in the United States (behind Apple and Microsoft), the largest Internet company by revenue in the world, and after Walmart, the second largest employer in the United States.</UTT>Pretty amazing statistics.  I wasn't aware they were the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure.  They are just going to grow bigger and bigger...</UTT>I know. They are now looking at empty Sears stores for their Whole Foods stores...</UTT>I heard that as well.  Well, it's been a pleasure speaking with you.  I hope you have a great weekend.</UTT>Cs lewis and tolkien held "you laugh you lose" competitions when reading terrible poetry</UTT>I was unaware of that.  I did know though that speed readers can process over 1000 words per minute though.</UTT>How many can they comprehend though... I would only get about 4 words...</UTT>Yeah, me as well.  Gotta run and get some stuff done before the NFL games come on.  Have a good day.</UTT>You too!
t_acb86961-1f69-433a-8bc9-ce0028b390a5</CONV>Did you ever watch ET?</UTT>Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!</UTT>Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that?</UTT>No, I haven't see it.  Have you?</UTT>I have't either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.</UTT>Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I'm sure Spielberg appreciated it!</UTT>Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.</UTT>It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!</UTT>Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems. I can totally imagine this happening in the future.</UTT>OMG, goodness, alot of people would def get hooked on that! Do you watch alot of movies?</UTT>I don't really though I like Disney movies. How about you?</UTT>Me too, I love Disney movies.  I read that Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped.</UTT>I didn't even know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop! Treasure Planet was also a Disney movie and was the most expensive box office flops of all times.</UTT>I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can't remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star.</UTT>Would  you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine's day? That's the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.</UTT>I remember seeing it, but it wasn't on Valentine's day!</UTT>Trojan Wars on the other hand ws a failure. It had a 15 million budget and earned only $309 in box office.</UTT>That's pitiful!</UTT>Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth's history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>Awesome, I read somewhere that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5 1/2 hours.</UTT>Wow, I can't even get enough done in 24 hours!
t_cd30e6c1-950c-4165-98a5-56e726ac887c</CONV>Hey there my friend you ever watch football on television?</UTT>I do not follow football but I do watch it occassionally.</UTT>I watch the Super Bowl. I don't normally watch a lot of sports though. Do you like the Patriots? They have a player that has never fumbled the ball before. His name is Benjarvus Green-Ellis</UTT>No I do not like the Patriots.  I think that is a former player though,  Yes that is impressive,  I wonder why this guy isnt more known</UTT>Yes I agree with you. Like I said I don't really watch sports so I'm not sure if he's a current player or not haha. What I do know is that ESPN won an Emmy. They created that yellow line that shows the first downs on football games</UTT>good for them!  I hear the highest score in football was 222-0!  That is crazy!</UTT>I know right! I can't believe that Georgia Tech was that much better. I would have left the stands once it got to 100 to 0 LOL</UTT>I know right,  lol me too!</UTT>What are your thoughts on Eli Manning? I know that he was super dominant back when he played.</UTT>I know Eli is short for Elisha.</UTT>That is really weird. Also I didn't know he was born in 1981. I've never heard the name Elicia before. also apparently he has a genius-level IQ</UTT>Thats amazing!  Is he related to Taryn Manning?  Shes from orange is the new black.</UTT>Oh I didn't know that. I've never seen that show so I have no idea. I guess he is the son of NFL quarterback Archie Manning in the younger brother of NFL quarterback Peyton Manning. It's definitely in their blood to be good quarterbacks haha</UTT>I dont know if he is related to her,  I was just asking. Yeah thats interesting.  I guess they just have that natural talent.</UTT>Did you know that the NFL uses tracking chips in the shoulder pads? They can track the location and position of all the players as well as the ball</UTT>Thats that is really cool,  they also put it in the football.</UTT>Yep you're right. They can tell the ball speed ,location, rotation and velocity, I just hope that they stopped the tracking after the players leave the field haha that would be super awkward</UTT>Its in their shoulder pads,  so I guess it depends where they take those lol</UTT>Haha yep well as long as they don't take anywhere those home LOL. What do you think of the fact that the NFL game on average only has about 11 minutes of gameplay, that seems solo to me</UTT>yeah that crazy, too many time outs, breaks,  commercials</UTT>Yep it gets annoying after a while. I wonder if we will ever have a female player, do you think that we will? There's no rule against it apparently
t_fd455adf-90b2-4bb2-8f02-b253f14b1bc7</CONV>Do you like watching sports?</UTT>don't have a lot of time to do that... sometimes...</UTT>What about television in general?</UTT>Tv shows and movies sometimes...</UTT>Sometimes I watch the Simpsons. There's only one episode where Bart does not appear and isn't mentioned.</UTT>wow :) they did alright without Bart ? I love cartoons like that - where they show cool satire on current events ;)</UTT>Yeah, I never got into anime cartoons though. There were 750 episodes of Pokemon made so I know they were highly popular.</UTT>Yeah... I mean my friends were always watching that... I could never convince myself to start...  the drawing looked like manga and the only manga cartoon I watched was about soccer and it was called "captain Tsubasa" ;)</UTT>Did you ever watch that 70s show?</UTT>Maybe an episode or two :) Not a fan of Ashton Kutcher</UTT>Apparently it was so popular that they made it verbatim in the UK. But it didn't work out as it was cancelled after ten episodes.</UTT>Did they air our American show or make their own ?</UTT>They remade it word for word.</UTT>word for word in actual english ? Maybe with their accent it's not so funny :)</UTT>Yeah, that  could have been it. Sometimes I try to watch NFL games but I find them boring. Maybe it's because there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay per game.</UTT>Yeah, I mean the game is being interrupted every couple of seconds... I can't watch that ;) my blood is boiling when I do :) lol</UTT>Yes, that is true. Our society takes football so seriously that tracking chips are embedded in shoulder pads and in footballs.</UTT>I heard about that...  is that really helping in... yeah, in what exactly ? :)</UTT>I'm not sure if it's for data purposes or if it helps make sure everything is fair.</UTT>Not sure either... so what do You think about female players join the game ? ;)</UTT>I think it would be great if they could meet eligibility requirements.
t_0e4c07bf-2e78-4efb-9ba6-4d3ca15bb88e</CONV>Hello - what do you like to do for entertainment?</UTT>Hi yes I love entertainment! I like the NFL it's as good entertainment as it gets! The NFL has no written rule against girls playing!</UTT>That's pretty cool. I wonder if a woman will join soon. Pretty crazy the average game has only 11 minutes of live gameplay.</UTT>Yeah that is surprising...Football players actually don't make all that much money. Over the course of a lifetime, engineers make more!</UTT>Yeah that is also surprising. And the NFL uses tracking chips on the players and the footballs.</UTT>Oh that's cool. Hopefully to get information on how to protect players more. It is kind of interesting the New Orleans Saints cheerladers can't eat at the same restaurant as the players.</UTT>Yeah that is kind of a silly rule I think.</UTT>Agreed. I also like to play video games and I used to have the original NES Nintendo. It only could display 54 colors but it impressed me!</UTT>The NES was discontinued in 2003 in Japan. I liked playing the NES also, I still have mine.</UTT>That's awesome! Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment exec said he didn't look presidential. Little did he know...</UTT>That's funny. And Bill Nye made it into the entertainment industry by winning a steve martin lookalike contest!</UTT>Oh wow interesting. I think if I played football I would want to be the quarterback. I would want to call plays in the huddle!</UTT>Oh cool - the huddle was created by Paul d. Hubbard. He was deaf. He used the huddle so that others teams couldn't read his hand signals!</UTT>That's a cool origin story of the huddle! The QB Alex Smith got his degree in 2 years in college because he took so many AP classes!</UTT>That's pretty impressive. Kellan moore is the only left-handed QB in the NFL.</UTT>Oh wow. Yeah now that I think of it all QB's are right handed. Tom Brady's highschool had a bad season when they never won a game or score a touchdown. Brady was the back up and he didn't even play! Hard to believe.</UTT>Yeah that is hard to believe - look at him now.</UTT>Football is a tough game. They play for 17 weeks straight with only one week off during the season.</UTT>Yeah it is - I could never do it. Well it has been nice talking to you - have a good day!</UTT>You as well! Have a good day!</UTT>:)
t_90a84553-6f04-4d98-adc2-cc83a21e3532</CONV>Do you play golf ?</UTT>Sure do! I try to hit the links at least one weekend a month. do you?</UTT>Yes, I do, I like being outdoors, and I like that each course is different.</UTT>I also loved playing Mario Golf as a kid back in the day</UTT>Yeah, playing golf in videos games could solve the water consumption issues of golf.</UTT>yea i bet it uses a lot of water for the sprinklers to water the course</UTT>In the US a course uses 312000 galons of water every day. It is kind of wasteful, doesn't it ?</UTT>thats insanely wasteful. I hope they recycle their water somehow!</UTT>I don't think  they can recycle the water once it is on the course, but rich people like to play golf, there is a golf course in dubai.</UTT>Sam Jackson gets to play often, he makes sure his film contacts allow him to play twice a week</UTT>Celebrities like to play golf, like Babe Ruth, he was the most famous golfer.</UTT>back in his day yea, but nowadays there are so many more famous players</UTT>Do you like to watch golf ? Or just play Mario golf ?</UTT>watching it is a snooze, i prefer to play it. you?</UTT>I don't like watching golf as entertainment, as you said, it is boring. But each person has his preferences, in Roman times, people bred chicken for entertainment.</UTT>now THAT sounds boring to me</UTT>If you were bored of your chicken, you could eat it.</UTT>well i guess thats a big upseide to it haha. Did you know the original NES could only show 52 colors?</UTT>I though it was 54, but I am really impressed what they could do with only 54 colors. maybe that is why they still sold it in 2003.</UTT>youre right! it is 54. It was a huge success in its day</UTT>What was you favorite game on the Nintendo entertainment system ?</UTT>I was big fan of the MegaMan games. How about you?</UTT>I liked racing games, but Mega Man was a really good game. I always started with metal man.</UTT>gotta get that Metal Blade as early as possible!
t_2a1b924d-5da5-4254-a079-6d358db6d06c</CONV>Do you still get a chance to listen to the radio?</UTT>Hello there, I do, I found a really good local station that I like, how about you?</UTT>I do. Did you know that the storms in Jupiter are so strong that they can be heard on an AM radio?</UTT>I think I have read about that before, that is really amazing!</UTT>I agree. Were you aware that you can make a radio with very little?</UTT>I think so, I think soldiers in WWI make them using a razorblade and a pencil.</UTT>Yes they did. They called them foxhole radios.</UTT>Good call!  I think any information or any form of entertainment they could get was well welcomed.</UTT>I'm sure it was. Have you heard any of the old radio dramas that were very popular beforeTV?</UTT>No I don't think I have, but I do know there is a website where you can listen to tons of them for free.</UTT>There is. I wonder if they still hold up?</UTT>I bet they do, but still are dated.  I think there are some real gems hidden in that bunch.</UTT>You're probably right. Did you know that by law 40% of music played on Canadian radio has to be Canadian?</UTT>I think I have heard about that, sounds pretty funny, but I bet the Canadian bands like it.</UTT>I would imagine so. So strange that they had to make a law. Are you interested in politics at all?</UTT>I am not, I think most of politics is just fighting to stay in position, how about you?</UTT>I agree with you but I also think it's important so I do have an interest. Did you know that until 1805 the runner up in a presidential race became the VP? Can you imagine that now?</UTT>That is very true.  And yeah isn't that wild, it would be a reality show for sure!</UTT>It would be crazy. On the lighter side, do yo know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?</UTT>I think he was called president Banana!  But, I think it was because his actual name was that.</UTT>He was! I'm not sure if that was his born name.
t_72c91d02-5643-4542-844b-97da1c8a0d59</CONV>Do you enjoy music?</UTT>I love music. How about you?</UTT>I enjoy country music</UTT>I like country music as well, not my favorite but i do enjoy some of it. Isnt it also called western and hillbilly music?</UTT>By some. It became popular since ford helped finance its spread out of fear of jazz</UTT>There are only two African Americans in the hall of fame for country music, so i guess it's not for everyone. still i enjoy it.</UTT>I wonder if it was a issue of talent or race</UTT>Not sure, some music just isn't for everyone. I can't do hard core heavy metal and I don't like the rap music today.</UTT>I think some rap is okay, but I agree with heavy metal. That music is just painful to hear, but hey it is a subjective topic. It is interesting how the fender stratocaster was originally intended for country music though</UTT>George Strait and Jeff Bezos are cousins.</UTT>What an amazing coincidence. Do you enjoy listening to music on radio or through albums?</UTT>probably the radio.How about You</UTT>I actually only listen through albums. I never really used the radio</UTT>Did you know there are storms on Jupiter that can be picked up by AM radio due to the strength of the storm?</UTT>I wonder what kinds of sounds you can pick up. I wonder if a foxhole radio could pick up Jupiter's storm as well</UTT>Not sure about that. Radio along with technology has come a long way.</UTT>I wonder if it is still often used in day to day life. I know there is a website to listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free, but not really sure how often people today use radios</UTT>Canada has made it law that 40% of its radio music is Canadian.</UTT>I guess that is one way to encourage the use of Canadian. Not sure how many people in Canada use radios though</UTT>Do you like Linkin Park?</UTT>I think they play wonderful music, especially their album hybrid theory</UTT>Did you know that it was the best selling album of the 21st century. wow!</UTT>Indeed that's why I checked it out. In any case thank you for the enjoyable chat.
t_41602fd0-8256-42cb-b4c1-29c686663162</CONV>Hey do you like baseball by the way? What do you think about the Nationals</UTT>I'm a big baseball fan!  I think they will do ok even though they lost Bryce Harper.  It's kind of the same situation like how they lost Jayson Werth a few years ago.</UTT>Speaking of baseball did you know that a baseball manager can actually play for the team if necessary?</UTT>That would be interesting to see!  That's one rule I didn't know.</UTT>Yep that's why they wear uniforms, also weird is that in Canada people is known as soccer baseball</UTT>That's interesting too!  Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 MLB games for 24 years.</UTT>That seems like a lot of work! Do you know why they stopped? The guy who found millions of dollars of baseball cards in his attic is a very lucky dude!</UTT>I don't know why they stopped.  I know I would stop working if I found a million dollars worth of baseball cards!  lol</UTT>Yep I could think of a lot of things to do with a million dollars lOL and I would be very happy that my grandfather had them in the Attic</UTT>Yes!  No doubt.  Did you know that the womens world cup had a higher tv ratings than the world series in the US?</UTT>No I didn't know that that's crazy. also crazy is that baseball is super popular in Japan, they even think that it is their National Pastime and not ours LOL</UTT>lol  Babe Ruth who was known for home runs was caught stealing to end game 7 of the 1926 world series?  Interesting useless stat.  lol</UTT>Haha what's an interesting stat. Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I know that's a change of topic</UTT>I've seen it but don't follow it close.  I know it got financed by Ireland because they film scenes there which boosts tourism incomes.</UTT>Yep you're right about that. I think it first premiered back in 2011 which seems like a long time ago, I can't wait for the new season to start in April</UTT>The next season is supposed to be the last one correct?</UTT>Yes it will be the last one. It's crazy that Charlie Chaplin's granddaughter is actually in Game of Thrones, I forget who she is though</UTT>Wow.  I never knew that.  How neat.  I'm going to have to binge watch it and get caught up before the last season begins.  I've heard that Arya is the fastest rising new baby name given to girls in the US most like because of Game of Thrones.</UTT>Haha you're right about that! And yes you should definitely check it out, they even made a knockoff series about lions called game of lions LOL</UTT>That's funny!  I see that Harry Lloyd who is on there is the great great great grandson of Charles Dickens.  That is neat they have 2 people related to famous people from a long time ago.</UTT>Yep I agree with you. There's even a guy who is the great grandson of Charles Dickens LOL they've got everyone in the show
t_41a9bd32-9197-41e0-aee5-cb941940a7d1</CONV>Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You !</UTT>Me too!  What do you think of the new NFL rule?</UTT>What is the new rule ?</UTT>regarding whether a QB is a runner or a passer and how they handle the hit on the quarterback</UTT>I think everybody will get used to it in time :) Did You know that Tom brady's wife, gisele bundchen, makes more than double her husband's salary ?</UTT>Oh wow... did not know that! Did you see Tom Brady's HS team had the worst season where they did not scor a touchdown and never once tried to bring in their back up QB who was Tom Brady?</UTT>What ? That sounds silly... why would they do that ?</UTT>No clue! How about kellan moore being the only QB in the NFL that is left handed... that's crazy!</UTT>I've heard that but I don't believe it... there has to be more like that...</UTT>you would think so... but why would that be a fact then?  What's even crazier is that NO Saint cheerleaders have to leave a restaraunt if a NO Saint player comes in</UTT>? why is that ? They have to hang out together ? ;)</UTT>I know right!  i guess they don't want them fratinizing!</UTT>I wouldn't mind to watch :)</UTT>To watch what?</UTT>fraternizing- sorry, I always see things with a sexual twist... lol</UTT>LOL... you must be a dude!  lmao!</UTT>Yeah... we are pigs ;)  but at least honest pigs ! ;)</UTT>that we are!!! See how they use tracking chips in pads and footballs?</UTT>I mean I've red that, but how does it help in an actual game ?</UTT>with statistics... and you know stats are part of the game! like there are only 11 minutes of gameplay</UTT>Yeah... that's one of the reasons I'm not really watching the games... the game is keep being interrupted...</UTT>true!  but i still watch!   maybe one day there will be a female player since there is no rule against them playing</UTT>Why should there be a rule like that ;) it would be interesting ;)</UTT>Definitely!  but then you would have to build a seperate locker room ofr them... LOL</UTT>oh c'mon, gender equality in sports ;) no way, they are changing with the boys :) lol</UTT>yeah right!  the feminist would have a field day! LMAO  What the... Tom Brady's wife makes more than he does!</UTT>Yeah... google how she looks... You'll understand... ;) lol</UTT>no need.. got her in my brain :p ALright... i'm out!  have a good one!
t_411bd87c-f778-4297-85aa-cec14ae70c7f</CONV>I am a huge NFL fan, how about you?I was mad the Patriots won the superbowl this year. I love the NFL because it is the highest professional level of football in the world!</UTT>Can't say I'm a huge fan.  I know my local teams but not much more, used to live in DC and now in the Cleveland area.  I'm fully aware of how much the Browns suck.</UTT>Oh nice. LOL yes they have definitely had their troubles! Have you ever played football? I never have but I would want to be quarterback because they are the leader of the offensive team.</UTT>Never, I played the other football, soccer.  Are you aware of this Derrius Guice player and his injury?</UTT>Oh nice, that is a good game as well. Yeah he tore his ACL what a disaster for him. Terrible injury. He hyperextended his knee while being tackled-ouch!</UTT>I always hear of players doing their ACL, I never really know what that means.</UTT>Yeah it i the ligament that prevents your thigh bone from moving anterior to your leg bone. Very common and very bad-need surgery to correct it. And he had some denial claiming that he could walk after the injury-sad that he didn't want his rookie season to end!</UTT>I'm sure he'll get the best treatment.  Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?  Even if you did want the Patriots to lose.</UTT>Yes I did. It wasn't a great game-very low scoring. Commercials were good though. Did you watch? The Patriots are like the Lannisters of the NFL (if you watch the game of thrones).</UTT>My niece always has birthday party on that weekend and we feel obliged to go since it's family.  My wife loves Game of Thrones so I end up watching with her.  I assume the Lannisters aren't good.</UTT>Oh nice. Yeah the Lannisters are the ones who hold power and always want control and power. The Patriots coach, Bill Belichick is the most winningest coach in the nfl post season with 21 wins. Quite respectable.</UTT>Wasn't there all that spying stuff with them, and deflate gate?</UTT>Yea there was! That was a huge scandal. They did get put on some probation for that but that's about it. Did you know there is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL?</UTT>I wonder if it makes a difference.  I know in some sports being left handed can be a advantage.  It's funny that Tom Brady couldn't make his high school at times.</UTT>Yeah thats a good point. Yes that is hard to believe-now he is considered the greatest of all time. That shows that natural abilities aren't everything! Apparently the football huddle was created by a deaf quarterback. pretty interesting.</UTT>I wasn't aware that Belichick had coached the Browns.  That was a long time ago, Cleveland winning a playoff game.</UTT>Oh yeah I didn't know that either. They have had a tough go thats for sure. Their last playoff win was back in 1995-wow!</UTT>Was that before they moved to Baltimore.  I know there's a lot of bad blood around here because of that.  Is there much difference with Canadian football?</UTT>Yeah good question I'm not sure. Yes there are definitely differences with the CFL not sure what exactly though. I know the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) was actually cut from the CFL before he started wrestling!</UTT>He looks like a football player.  So who is your favorite NFL team?</UTT>My favorite team is the Seattle Seahawks since that is where I'm from. Also thats why I don't like the Patriots-they beat us in the Superbowl a few years back.</UTT>I've heard you have a noisy stadium, is that true?</UTT>Yeah I have been to a game before and it is deafening! Can't even hear yourself talk. It was a great time but I prefer to watch games on tv-just more comfortable.</UTT>Have a good day, goodbye.</UTT>You too bye!</UTT>Bye
t_25545134-2ea9-42f6-a0d1-8ac51c25ea3f</CONV>Kristen Bell's TV show "The Good Place" sounds interesting. I haven't seen it, but I have heard it is very funny.</UTT>Ive seen the first season,  it is great!  very funny!</UTT>What did you think of the plot twist at the end of the season? That seems hilarious.</UTT>It definitely something I wasnt expecting!  Its super funny when she is in heaven and heaven censors all her cursing lol "what the shirt" "holy fork"</UTT>I think I'll have to watch it, then. That sounds hysterical! Has season 2 come out yet?</UTT>Yes it has!  I just started watching it.  its kind of frustrating though.  I guess Ill have to keep watching.</UTT>Frustrating in what way? Is it a rehash of the first season?</UTT>No.  at the end of season one,  michael resets them.  so season 2 they have no memory and they figure out they know each other and michael finds out they figured it out and resets them again......etc  Its like Im not sure where they are goin with this</UTT>Gotcha. Does it seem like a commentary on religion or God? I have heard that it seems like an analogy for heaven / hell.</UTT>They definitely touch on God and it is set in heaven /hell.  No mention of religion at all from what I remember.</UTT>Cool. I'm a Christian with a well developed sense of humor, but I don't like overtly disparaging commentary. There is enough on TV that is trash without adding to it.</UTT>Its made in good taste.  Its a really fun comedy.  Kristen Bell is amazing! Do you watch a lot of tv?  did u know There is only one episode of "the simpsons" where bart neither appears, nor is mentioned</UTT>I don't really watch much TV, to be honest. We "cut the cord" a few years ago. That is interesting about the Simpsons! I haven't seen that show in years, but I don't remember one with no Bart. I'll have to try to find that one on YouTube!</UTT>Yeah me too!</UTT>Speaking of interesting TV and film trivia, do you remember that in 1997 the show "3rd Rock from the Sun" won the golden globe for best comedy? It beat out "Frasier", "Friends", and "Seinfeld"! I did not remember that!</UTT>I dont remember that either,  but that show was so fun! There are over 750 episodes of "pokemon." that's about 50 a year for 16 years straight.</UTT>LOL. There is so much TV and movie trivia out there! It is amazing to think that in just a couple of generations, really, TV and film has become such an integral part of our popular culture.</UTT>I know right!  And way too many good shows to even keep up with!</UTT>Exactly!  Sometimes it takes me 15 minutes or longer to find something to watch when I am searching on Netflix or Amazon. There are so many choices, and I'm only able to see what they actually have in their library!</UTT>Right!  I always try n go for recommendations from friends I cant deal with looking for stuff.  An hour will pass and I still wont find anything lol</UTT>Same here, but I do like the "because you watched X" feature. It helps me find additional programming similar to what I know I like.</UTT>nice talkin to u,  have a good one.  Hope u enjoy The Good Life!
t_7f7ca85d-5a4d-4f75-9320-a1e2378dd187</CONV>Good morning!</UTT>Good morning!  How do you feel about the safe space movement?</UTT>I honestly have never heard of it. What is it about?</UTT>It is where kids are to be free from bullying, and stuff like that.  Sometimes its blown out of proportion saying kids should have it easy, but thats not really the case.</UTT>I wouldn't think so. How does not allowing bullying make kids soft?</UTT>I guess they are claiming kids need to learn to deal with adversity and stick up for them selves.  I just think we all need to be nicer.</UTT>I got to agree with you. I had to tolerate my son being bullied. Once he stood up for himself it stopped. But it should not have happened at all. I think it's wrong.</UTT>I agree.  I teach martial arts, and we teach the kids to just be strong and confident, people dont pick on strong confident people.</UTT>Thats a great thing to do! I take kids fishing. Really get to know them in the county. Do you fish?</UTT>I do not.  I have a hard time touching them, so slimy.</UTT>They can be. The kids love it though.Did you know freshwater fish drink water through osmosis and not their mouth?</UTT>No, thats pretty cool!  I do know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.</UTT>Isn't that wild! Scientists are studying it too! 87% of genes that are found in humans are also found in zebra fish.I wonder if they get the common cold?</UTT>Maybe, it could also help us cure things.  Maybe it can get on board with that jellyfish and we can start trying to cure cancer</UTT>God, that would be wonderful. I read that seahorses are the only fish that have necks too!</UTT>I guess I never thought about that before, but it makes sense.</UTT>Just a fun little fact I heard on the radio. Do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Sometimes, but more into podcasts right now.   There is so much variety on the radio though.</UTT>I don't listen to many podcasts. Is there a website for them? I've been looking to listen to Jupiters storms myself.</UTT>I just listen on an app called podcoin, you collect points for podcasts you listen too.  I want to hear Jupiter's storms myself.  I bet they are interesting.</UTT>I'll have to look into that, thank you. I did look up the website where you can listen to old radio dramas. It was really funny!</UTT>That is cool, Ill have to check that out then.  It sounded interesting!</UTT>I listened to a horror one. Laughed my butt off. They are like from the 30's. Did you know in canada they have to play 40% of canadian music?</UTT>I heard that, I guess they are Jamming out to Bieber and Drake all day</UTT>And Celine dion! Have a good day!
t_312528fb-b18c-48a6-9edf-55aa5a544edb</CONV>hi how are you? do you like to dance?</UTT>I do but I am not great! Did you know Tupac danced ballet in high school?</UTT>i heard that. I guess he was a talented guy in many ways.</UTT>Yes, I agree. I guess professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.</UTT>i figure that ballet must be hard on the feet too. i would not want to do it. then again, i cant</UTT>I would not  either. Do you know babies dance spontaneously when they hear dance music. With the internet we can really see a lot of entertaining videos.</UTT>yes, quite true. much more entertainment in our lives. i wonder if it is a good thing though.</UTT>Well, I know that constant novelty from clicking links on the internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain.</UTT>i believe that. anything that releases chemicals can become an addiction.</UTT>I'm not sure. Hard to believe there is 3g cell service and internet capabilities at the peak of Mt. Everest.</UTT>i believe it. people need to upload their selfies. it is a great opportunity to show off to your followers.</UTT>I guess so. Amazing how Facebook has changed our lives. It's hard to believe it was launched 2-4-04.</UTT>yeah, it has changed a lot of lives. probably caused a lot of divorces too. LOL</UTT>It's hard to believe Myspace turned down an offer to buy FB for $75 million in early 2005!</UTT>yeah, they missed their chance to get it at a bargain. i wonder how fb would have turned out then.</UTT>I never thought about it that way, but yeah. Funny that Burger King had a promotion that offered you a Whopper if you unfriended 10 people on FB. Too funny.</UTT>I wonder how many people partipated in that campaign. free calories for dumping your friends.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder. Did you know FB is primarily blue because the founder is red-green colorblind?</UTT>I heard that. Mark should spend some money on finding a cure. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>I wonder if there is a cure. I am surprised that FB allows anyone that claims to be 13 to get an account. Wow!</UTT>pretty young for social media. Have a good day!</UTT>I agree. You have a good day as well. Bye.
t_a8d9902b-f29c-4283-b617-8ade948685db</CONV>Hi.  Are you a fan of the Patriots American football team?</UTT>I'm not a fan, but I don't hate them either. I saw their owner Kraft just got in trouble.</UTT>Yeah, I heard about that.  I also not a fan but Brady is worthy of respect.</UTT>Brady is probably going to be the best QB in NFL history. I think the sport is in decline. I'm a fan, but the younger generations don't watch it as much.</UTT>I haven't noticed it.  I think selfish fools like Kaepernick are hurting the game by bringing their politics to a pastime that people go to avoid such things.</UTT>I'm sure that doesn't help, most people can't stand politics.</UTT>Politics seems to be in EVERYTHING now.  Sick of it... I bet Pats fans aren't sick of their red zone effectiveness.</UTT>Did you know there is only 11 minutes of live gameplay in an NFL game?</UTT>I can believe it.  I played in HS and there was a lot of standing around.  Injuries really hurt the game like that of T Y Hilton who got pretty banged up by the Texans.</UTT>Yeah, I was unaware that the NFL uses chips to track the players during the game, did you know that?</UTT>I heard about that.  They are putting chips in everything now. Do you like Drew Brees?  He thinks every number has a purpose when it comes to exercise.</UTT>Interesting, this is the Saints QB?</UTT>Yep.  He's a dude even though the NFL has no rule against women playing.  Sorry Drew...</UTT>Interesting. I also know that the NFL has only one left handed quarterback these days. Did you?</UTT>Yeah, it's nothing like baseball pitchers... Funny, the Bills have tied the Pats in Superbowl losses.</UTT>I can believe that, they were in a lot of super bowls when I was younger.</UTT>Did ya know the circular huddle originated because the QB was deaf?  I thought it was to facilitate communication (verbal).</UTT>No, I didn't know that, was it to hide the hand signals.</UTT>Yeah.  Back to your point of the NFL in decline.  There is actually a QB that's considering giving up football to go to competitive gaming.  Our heroes of the future?</UTT>Interesting, twitch is a pretty popular website, it wouldn't surprise me.</UTT>Thanks for the chat!
t_3373991c-2495-49a2-aad7-f2faa04b7261</CONV>hey there did you know that JFK was one of the wealthiest US presidents?</UTT>No, I did not know though... I did know George Washington was one as well.  I wonder where JFK got all his money from... I mean, what type of business his family was into..</UTT>right, I would like to know that too, I know Washington and Jefferson had slaves, I dont' know what JFK did</UTT>Lots of neat facts about the Presidents floating around... did you know that up until 1805 the runner up in the election became Vice President?  Can only imagine all the tension THAT would have created...</UTT>Haha that would be wild with President Trump and VP Hillary, talk about drama and dysfunction!</UTT>Oh, they'd be going at it like cats and dogs!  Might make for some fun interviews though.  LOL.  Speaking of presidents, did you know the President of Indonesia release THREE pop albums while in office?</UTT>wow that is impressive, I always said Trump and Hillary should release an album to heal the political wounds and then donate the money to chartiy!</UTT>I just can't imagine either of those two singing.  Heck, can't really imagine any president from the past few years singing.  Although I've heard some impersonators do some funny impressions of Bill Clinton singing.. Hehe.</UTT>haha ya and at least he does play the Saxophone so he could participate still haha</UTT>Now this is weird, thy say the president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana.  I'm not sure if that's as in "top banana" or if "banana" means something else over there, but I thought that was interesting...</UTT>I think I looked it up and his actual last name is Banana, so ya theres that.</UTT>ahhh well that makes sense.  Still, I like my "Top Banana" theory!  Lol.  Speaking of politics, did you know the Senate has the same gavel for 165 years?  Now that thing was built to last!</UTT>haha well ya they had the same gavel until Nixon cracked it, bad omen!</UTT>Wonder if he just banged it a bit too hard or if he was angry about something.  Nixon strikes me as a guy who got annoyed with things a lot... hehe.</UTT>haha ya he definitely has a tempor on him, very dumb that women couldn't wear pants in teh senate until 1993 too</UTT>Yeah, I heard they staged a protest to get that changed.  I guess it's a good thing, otherwise Hillary's wouldn't be able to wear her favorited pantsuits!  Hehe</UTT>lol that funny, and ya good on Mikulski and Braun, that took courage to do the protest I'm sure</UTT>They say the Senate has a tradition of a candy desk. Any Senator sitting near a busy entrance has to keep a drawer full of candy.  That'd be worth being a Senator for, right there!</UTT>that makes me hungry! and apparently all candy is from Pennsylvania! mmmmm chocolate haha</UTT>Now, here's a weird one, did you know it took the Secret Service four DAYS to realize bullets had been fired at the White House on November 11, 2011?  Granted, those things can travel pretty far, but still...</UTT>wow that is very wild! You'd think they'd be on the ball with that! GWB put solar panels on the white house btw
t_24dc0946-4489-44c4-ae47-d95ed5f2c147</CONV>Hello do you like the radio?</UTT>Yea, I'm a big fan of am radio.It's pretty cool there's a website that streams all the classical radio dramas for free</UTT>Yeah that is cool,  have you had a chance to check it out?</UTT>Not not yet although I have some very old christian radio dramas on am radio once at like 2am</UTT>Thats cool. I hear jupiter storms can be heard on the radio</UTT>I did too, I wonder what AM station you have to tune to to pick up Jupiter's radio storms</UTT>I have no clue,  I was hoping you would know lol</UTT>I'll have to google it. It's pretty funny canadian radio by law has to play 40% of its songs by Canadian artists</UTT>Thats very patriotic of them!  Do you like animals?</UTT>Yea, animals are cool, crazy ther are over 1.5 million living species on earth</UTT>That is crazy!  Over 20 quintillion animals,  how many zeroes are in a quintillion lol</UTT>No clue but it's scary that most of those animals are insects</UTT>Ugh,  Have you ever watched naked and afraid?  they always get eaten by a million mosquitos on the first night,  it looks annoying and its on tv lol</UTT>yea, if I was Germany I would exclude insects from their constitutionally guaranteed legal rights for animals</UTT>Lol i agree!  In scotland the loch ness monster is a protected species.  Do you believe it exists?</UTT>No but I wish the Loch Ness monster did, I guess either way it's a good thing it's protected just in case</UTT>Did you know that there is a planet that shards of glass precipitate?</UTT>Sounds terrifying, so does Venus' lack of seasons</UTT>Sounds cold lol</UTT>Depends on if Venus is facing the sun, it's either brutally cold or incredibly hot</UTT>Oh right.</UTT>well I have to go, nice chatting with you
t_5d6e6423-afdb-488f-9771-e1c00c5985b1</CONV>Hey there do you use Facebook? What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg?</UTT>I think that he is a dude who is in charge of a massively different product that he anticipated</UTT>Yeah I could see that. I also never knew that he was colorblind and that is the reason that Facebook is blue</UTT>thats an interesting factoid.</UTT>Did you know that Iceland is writing their constitution on Facebook. People can make suggestions and also alter it on the Facebook page.</UTT>that is an interesting way to keep a living document. do they have age restrictions because you can be 13 and be on facebook legally.</UTT>That's a great point. We don't want people putting fortnite or something like a video game into the Constitution. did you hear about the Facebook promotion with Burger King?</UTT>their paid content can be out of hand. I usually ignore the ads.</UTT>I do too. What would happen is that if you unfriended 10 people on Facebook, then you'll get a free Whopper. Also the person you unfriended would be alerted to this unfriending and that they were only worth one tenth of a Whopper haha</UTT>thats funny. I would totes unfriend people for a whopper. i like whoppers way more than I like people.</UTT>I would do that too. I wish I could do that right now and get some food I'm starving haha. What's crazy is that Facebook is valued at over 104 billion dollars. That could buy a lot of Whoppers!</UTT>I would use some of that billions for the Hershey pie too though.</UTT>Yeah I could see that too. Now what about Netflix do you watch Netflix at all?</UTT>heck yeah. I think its crazy that blockbuster didn't take them seriously.</UTT>Nope Blockbuster definitely made a big mistake there. Chance to buy them for 50 million and now Netflix is worth over 2 billion. Very sad</UTT>i thought it was cool that they track illegal downloads to know what titles to have.</UTT>I think that's a good strategy actually. I think it's funny that Netflix was started because the guy had a late copy of Apollo 13. That's a solid movie</UTT>I think i fell asleep when i watched it. i'm glad that they have so many movies with good rotten tomatoes ratings.</UTT>Yep that makes life easy for me haha very crazy that Netflix makes up about one-third of all bandwidth in North America. That is an insane amount</UTT>it is wild how much it is watched compared to traditional tv.</UTT>Oh I agree with you. I personally don't even watch normal TV I only watch Netflix at this point
t_825a1665-da4b-400e-8764-39a53606d983</CONV>Are you familiar with theater?</UTT>I actually am. do you like shakespeare and his plays?</UTT>Neat. I like Shakespeare as far as his words. I had no idea one could be so accomplished and win so many awards within theater? This guy in article Section 3 has won eight awards acting in theater. Amazing.</UTT>neat, good for him for managind to do that. did you know shakespeare and pocahontas lived at the same time</UTT>That's an awesome fact. They apparently only died a year apart as well. Shakespeare also invented names: Miranda, Jessica and Olivia.</UTT>that is so cool. did you know he intentionally made grammar errors?</UTT>He was such a genius. His plays have been translated into every major living language, and apparently are performed more than any other. Amazing.</UTT>he was just amazing overall. he did that to get the attention of his audience</UTT>Agreed. I had no idea he was married. He married, Anne Hathaway and also had three children. The man certainly lived a life.</UTT>for sure. there are 33 shakespeare gardens in the world</UTT>Fascinating. I am from an area that has a Shakespeare Festival every year. It's amazing. A real human skull was used in a few performances of Hamlet, how crazy,</UTT>yeah do you know who the skull belonged to?</UTT>Andre Tchaikowsky, a Polish composer. He donated it so it could be used that way.</UTT>yeah, good thing is that his wish was granted</UTT>Yeah, I find it fascinating. Apparently Shakespeare has coined a variety of terms and phrases we use today; "laughing stock, good riddance, brave new world." The man changed culture with words…</UTT>he did for sure. do you ever watch the academy awards?</UTT>Never. I hear about them. I feel like the 24 awards are a generic way to praise someone.</UTT>yeah and they were even nominated for 9 emmys</UTT>Who was nominated for 9 Emmy's?</UTT>the oscars. i don't even know in what category.</UTT>Weird...... I honestly had no idea there where so many different institutions with award ceremonies.</UTT>yeah me either. nice chat
t_19cce315-efa0-4bc8-bb91-2e79f5b14a7b</CONV>Hi! Do you ever watch soccer?</UTT>You mean football!! Yes I love it.</UTT>Haha, sorry, football it is! Just didn't want to get confused between the types. Do you have a favorite team?</UTT>I really don't, I just get into it for the World Cup. Fair Weather fan I guess. Haha</UTT>Can't blame you. The World Cup is really exciting, and it's about the only time I watch too. Sometimes I root for a team just for the hype though.</UTT>You can not go wrong With Mexico or Brazil. Did you know That the US placed in the first World Cup in 1930</UTT>I didn't know that! I have heard that the US women's World Cup team is pretty stellar, though.</UTT>Football (soccer)is the most popular sport in the world played in more than 200 countries. I was in Thailand and they have no idea what american football is, haha</UTT>It's amazing how far-reaching the sport is. I don't think there's a single other sport that has an international audience in the same way.</UTT>with 250 million players that is definitely hard to beat</UTT>I wonder if they count junior players in that 250 million. If they did, then I was one of the count as a kid!</UTT>I never played, I have a nephew that plays he loves it, Have you ever heard of the 3 team matches?</UTT>Three team matches? I can't imagine how that would work. It sounds complicated, and it doesn't sound like it would work on the standard rectangular pitch.</UTT>I am not sure exactly, But it would be fun to watch!</UTT>I'd love to see some top FIFA teams try playing that way. They practice so much for the normal game, it would be interesting to see them adapt to a new field.</UTT>I had gone to a game last year in The stadium that the Patriots play in. It was a great time.</UTT>Is there an association football team called the Patriots too? I'd only ever heard of the American football team, and I didn't think the stadiums could be used for both.</UTT>Yeah the New England Patriots football team, Their Stadium is also the home of the New England Revolution of Major Soccer League.</UTT>I had no idea! It's cool that they share a name like that. What team did you get to see them play against?</UTT>I do not remember, to be honest.</UTT>No worries. Sometimes sports is so exciting and full of energy that the details slip my mind too!
t_5c6d1905-3160-4636-8a7f-e0a85a090166</CONV>Hey are you a fan of Brent Cobb?</UTT>I'm not sure who he is, actually. Could you tell me how I should know of him?</UTT>He's a country singer/songwriter. His shyness almost prevented him from reaching stardom.</UTT>Oh, yes, I've heard of him. He's from Georgia, right?</UTT>Yeah, Ellaville, GA. He grew up in a musical family so music is in his blood.</UTT>I wonder if he collected his family albums. Do you still have any physical albums, or is everyone all online now?</UTT>If I have any albums they are CDs from the 90s and probably lost in an attic or basement. What about you?</UTT>I still collect vinyl records. I'd love a copy of Dark Side of the Moon on vinyl. It was still one of the best selling albums a few years ago even though it was recorded over 40 years ago.</UTT>That's a good album. Kind of interesting that Linkin Park has the best-selling album in the 21st century though I don't think they compare to Pink Floyd</UTT>Definitely. It surprising how long cassettes lasted compared to the CD.</UTT>I guess there was more advancement in technology around the time CDs were out. Are you a fan of NWA?</UTT>Heck yeah. Straight Outta Compton is a classic that never got a lot of radio play.</UTT>Strange considering how popular it was/is. That was the first album to reach platinum status without support from radio play or a major tour.</UTT>Well, I doubt they were played much in Canada. They have a law that 40% of radio played is from a Canadian artist.</UTT>They probably play Drake 95% of the time. Radios are quite an interesting invention huh? Yet nowadays they seem pretty simple from a surface level.</UTT>Did you know that Jupiter as storms so strong they can be heard from an AM radio?</UTT>I think I heard that from somewhere before. I do know that WW2 soldiers created "foxhole radios" by simply using a razorblade and pencil as a diode.</UTT>That's nuts. I wonder if they could pick up storms on Jupiter.</UTT>Well back then if they did hear storms from Jupiter they probably didn't know it and thought their radios were busted haha</UTT>Well, it was only WW2. People knew Jupiter existed in the 1940s.</UTT>I wonder if they had the knowledge or technology back then to identify whether a radio signal was from jupiter</UTT>Oh, maybe not. Though radio has been around for like, a hundred years.

Can you believe the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy?</UTT>That is mind blowing. I wonder how scientist know that information or measure it.</UTT>You and me both lol. Do you know much about cars?</UTT>A little bit. Have you ever been in a self driving car?</UTT>I haven't! Have you?</UTT>No but I heard that google's cars have an aggressive mode.</UTT>No way! I bet that is for big city driving haha. They ought to put flame throwers on them too!</UTT>That is crazy. Did you know it is illegal to warm up your car in ohio?</UTT>I didn't know that! I wonder why? Do you know?</UTT>I guess there was to many thefts with the keys just sitting in empty cars.</UTT>Well that makes sense! Have you heard why Cadillac is named the way it is?</UTT>I have not? Do you know?</UTT>It was named after the founder of Detroit, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac!</UTT>That is a good name!

Ryan Stiles also dropped out of school to pursue comedy!</UTT>Are you a fan of bill murray's comedy</UTT>I am not too familiar with him.

Are you a drama fan?</UTT>Yes big time, I love dramas like the godfather and city of god</UTT>Those are good! I love how Jim Carey wont make anymore dramas because of his belief system.</UTT>Jim Carey is one of the best comedians of our times he's so diverse think of all his movies from The Mask to Bruce Almighty he's amazing</UTT>Those are great movies. Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor for tv drama. Must be nice.</UTT>Have you ever seen hugh laurie in House? he's amazing his accent is so good you could never figure out he's actually british</UTT>I have not!

I look up stuff all the time like what is that 3 horizontal line icon called.  It's called a "hamburger".  Makes me hungry now.</UTT>Me too, I never knew the internet was a contraction of interconnected network, makes sense.</UTT>I just learned that recently too.  Did you know that there is a 3G cell service on the top of Mt. Everest?</UTT>I did not know, closer to the satelites right? haha</UTT>Or to order a pizza delivered after the climb? Do you read the full terms when you buy something off of internet?  Only 7% do...</UTT>I never have, that's a surprisingly high number, I wonder who is all reading them? Do you?</UTT>I wouldn't know.  I don't either.  I just keep making Bezos rich, unquestioned.  Wow, I didn't know IMDB was owned my Amazon.</UTT>Bezos is so rich he built a clock on a mountain that will run for 10,000 years, I wonder how accurate it will be then with the shifting daylight hours. That's pretty crazy about IMDB.</UTT>I know.  Trustbusters to the rescue!  His poor workers walk 7-15 miles each day on one shift.</UTT>Trust busters as in the anti-monopoly people? I would not mind seeing them around now a days.</UTT>Yeah, they've been lazy lately.  Funny, the 1st Amazon customer got a building named after him! I would rather have money...</UTT>Me too, but getting a building named after you for $27.95 is a pretty good deal too. I feel bad for those warehouse workers though, 7-15 miles a day and crappy pay and no insurance until recently.</UTT>Even the USPS makes deals with him to deliver on Sunday!  They would snub little ol' me for sure.</UTT>For sure, Ali Baba Group isn't too far behind them, ever order from them?</UTT>No but I've seen their stuff (I think).  Do you like country music? I can take it in small doses.</UTT>Not really a huge fan of it to be honest. Never knew George Strait and Bezos are cousins though, that's crazy.</UTT>I do like him.  I thought it was hilarious that Henry Ford helped bolster country music because he thought it was decadent. Something tells me he wouldn't be a fan of rap.</UTT>Haha, he would not have been. U2 was a huge country music fan too, they used to open for themselves playing country music.</UTT>I didn't know that.  I also didn't know the Fender Stratocaster (Strat) was intended for country music.  It's a rock icon now...</UTT>That is pretty crazy, I wonder what that would have sounded like in the 1970s with country music haha.</UTT>Maybe that's where rock really got it's kick?  Thanks for the great chat!</UTT>Great chatting with you too, have a great rest of the night!

I like it that our forecast is going to end up in the 50's-60s</UTT>Im in chicago and I would like high 30s at this point. A week or two ago we had temps at -30!</UTT>Yeah I am not a polar vortex fan!  Chicago should move closer to the sun - a perfect sphere of hot plasma!</UTT>It's actually white too! I would have never guessed it!</UTT>It is about 109 times larger than earth - and about 330k heavier  - that is huge!</UTT>Yeah. But a lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the sun. That seems odd.</UTT>Wow that is pretty crazy.  Did you know that on mars the sunset is blue?  I wonder why that is</UTT>I had no idea. I bet it looks pretty. Neptune sure takes its time going around the sun!</UTT>How long does Neptune take?  I did not realize the sun rotates as well.</UTT>It completed its first full orbit in 2011 since it was in 1846!</UTT>Wow.  That is pretty nuts.  Just as nuts as a radio station that plays the sounds the sun makes!</UTT>It is the most important source of energy for life on earth! It deserves its own radio station!</UTT>No doubt it is important, but for many of us amazon seems almost as important.  I buy everything from food to books to toys there.</UTT>Were you their first customer?</UTT>No but that would have been cool because I would have had a building named after me</UTT>I would drive by it just to check in! I would also brag to all my friends. They would think I am obnoxious!</UTT>laugh.  I love amazon's logo - they really do have everything from a to z</UTT>They do! Nice chatting with you!
t_f1929cac-0fce-433d-b628-4d068365532e</CONV>hi how are you doing tonight? are you a dog person?</UTT>Yes!  My dog is sleeping next to me now!</UTT>You are lucky. i wish i had a dog. cant manage one at the moment though.</UTT>When you can get one from shelter.  Best dog ever!  The dog is first animal to be domesticated.</UTT>Why a shelter? dont people pick ones of a certain breed with certain traits?</UTT>Save a life!  Though I feel like my dog saved me!  They vary in sizes and shapes for sure.</UTT>Oh, ok. i guess youre right. did you take your dog to obedience school?</UTT>Nope, already house trained, great with kids, very polite and loving!  No issues!   Dogs can learn over 1000 words!</UTT>Yes, but how will they do on the SAT? LOL. i know that dog are pretty clever at figuring things out too.</UTT>Yes very reward based.</UTT>I guess we all are to an extent. what do you think of google then?</UTT>Google?  I use it to research dogs, comedy or fantasy!</UTT>Yes, google is a dog company. they let emmployees bring dogs. that is great. dogs in the office make for a friendly atmosphere.</UTT>Oh wow, would love to bring dog to work.  Maybe the would have the eureka moments to solve a problem for Google lol.</UTT>Yeah, they could be good at testing. "What is it, Lassie? Is there something wrong with the server code?"</UTT>I would not be surprised if they are selectively bred to code!</UTT>Yeah,thats right. Google would have some special group to breed "coder" dogs.LOL</UTT>They regard them highly in Russia.  There is a unknown dog tomb</UTT>I know the dogs in moscow learn how to ride the subway. i guess they know the good spots for food. LOL</UTT>Dogs have extra senses which make them useful for many roles other than companionship like police and military even</UTT>Yeah, they have some color vision too. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>I wanted to end by this...the other night I went outside at 2am to put out trash.  My dog sensed something and started growling.  She never growls.  Then a figure ran away from us!  Get a doggie!</UTT>Yes, will do! Good night!</UTT>Take care!
t_789d443a-1220-4df8-8dd6-1c36bd62d1a2</CONV>Hi, how are you?</UTT>I'm good, just getting ready to watch some basketball today. How about you?</UTT>That's cool, I'm going to try to catch some basketball games myself, today.  Who's your favorite player?</UTT>Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is my all-time favorite. He was such a dominant dunker that he got it banned from college basketball for over a decade!</UTT>I like him too, his use of the dunk was epic and I can see why it got banned.  My favorite player is Lebron James.</UTT>I like Lebron too, I can't wait to see his "Space Jam" sequel.</UTT>Me either, my grandkids really liked the original Space Jam.</UTT>I really liked it too. Did you know that Physicist proved that shooting "granny style" is the absolute best technique to consistently make free throws, but NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid to them?</UTT>I had heard that and yes, it does look stupid, but I'd do it myself it it got some points scored.  Lol Do you remember when Air Jordans first came out and the NBA banned them?</UTT>I do, and he wore them anyways. Nike was willing to pay the fine each game.</UTT>Nike sure has lots of money to do that.  They also gave Lebron James $ 90 million in a deal after he turned down $10 million form Reebok a year earlier, because he said Nike or Adidas might offer him more.  King James was correct!</UTT>Indeed he was! Speaking of Reebok, Allen Iverson signed a lifetime deal with them in 2001 that pays him $800,000 a year until he reaches 55.</UTT>Wow, he was smart, also, because that deal pays him a final lump sum of $32,000,000 if I'm not mistaken.</UTT>That's right, he should be set if he's smart about his money. Another smart player is Tim Duncan, he sacrificed money and actually stayed in college for four years instead of going directly to the NBA.</UTT>Yes, that was very smart on his part.</UTT>Did you know that in 39 states in the US, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach? That's pretty wild!</UTT>Yes, it is.  Did you know the US supreme court has a court on the top floor known as the highest court in the land?</UTT>Oh wow, that's kind of neat. I wonder if they ever play any pickup games during a break?</UTT>Could you see Ruth Bader Ginsburg in her sneakers shooting granny style?  lol</UTT>I would pay to see that! lol</UTT>Me too, she's a beast!  Hope she's on the mend after her recent fall, though.  On a different note, did you know the New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed the Tall blacks?  Isn't that kind of racist, to you?</UTT>Yeah that is pretty racist. I don't think I would want to wear any of their memorabilia. Did you know that the inventor of basketball, James Naismith, is the only losing coach in the University of Kansas history?</UTT>Me either very racist.  I don't know how they get away with that in 2019?  Anyway, I think it's very ironic about James Naismith, as the inventor he should have rigged the game of basketball to allow his teams to win.</UTT>It brings a new meaning to "beating you at your own game." lol</UTT>Haha, that's so true!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you this morning.  I need to get to work, talk to you later, friend.
t_2577438b-ec45-46a5-a2e5-512365d99fe8</CONV>Hi Turker, are you a NFL fan, if yes, did you think the chief should had been in the Superbowl?</UTT>The NFL? The National Football League? I do not who the chiefs are. Is that a team?</UTT>Yes, the Kansas City Chiefs were one of the top undefeated team in nfl 2018.</UTT>Oh, and they were not the champions? I thought undefeated would make them the best. What happened?</UTT>I am pretty sure New England Patriots beat them which ever one disagree with the call by the referee.</UTT>Oh, ok. I guess the referees made a mistake, a controversial one that helped the Patriots? I guess that happens.</UTT>Yes, well I just thought I would get your opinion, but that over with now, what do you think about women in the NFL?</UTT>I think that women would not be powerful enought to play in the NFL. Women usually have their own leagues.</UTT>Yes, that's my opinion, maybe they should get a WNFL team and see how well that work.</UTT>I think that it would be a different game, maybe some rules would change, I don't know. There is a WNBA. I guess it could work.</UTT>Yes that's true, but I think their ratings are low, not too many people talk about the wnba.</UTT>True. I think that the women's games tend to be slower and not as aggressive.</UTT>Yes you are right, I like to see three pointer, slam dump and other complicated shooting, not just regular shooting.</UTT>I expect that women will want to join but I don't think the game can be balanced for them.</UTT>I wouldn't want to see the tackling if the NFL was co-ed</UTT>yeah I don't think I would like it</UTT>You are so right, do you believe the average NFL game has 11 minutes of live game play?</UTT>I think that 11 minutes is short, yet there are so many injuries. Very dangerous. that is why they get paid.</UTT>Yes that's true, but I still think playing time over 11 minutes, It take me about eleven minutes just to have a nice meal at my table. Eleven minutes isn't any time at all.</UTT>True. I guess they are paid to stand around and wait. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>It was nice chatting with you, I will read more about space.
t_7c970c1f-484b-48c9-9446-043a9eb5b314</CONV>Sean Hannity had an awkward moment, and his quoting of Braking Bad made him look really bad</UTT>LOL... yeah right!  But i don't think he was quoting breaking bad was he?  I think they were comparing his quote to a scene in Breaking Bad?</UTT>Well it sure was similar to the series lol, maybe he didnt do it with the intentioin but it was almost the same as the shady scene with Saul and the $10 bucks.</UTT>Yeah, of course! I wonder how Sean felt after he said it and realized what he said?</UTT>I bet he felt pretty bad, he did tried to justify himself but he already made a huge mistake and lets face it Cohen is a really shady lawyer.</UTT>At least he Hannety didn't go to the lengths like white and pinkman did taking Saul out to the desert?  LOL</UTT>I agree lol although he still has time for sure. What a good series Breaking Bad was! I used to love that show</UTT>Yeah for sure... many of late nights binge watching Breaking Bad!    Just crazy how Sean thought he never retained Cohen!</UTT>Someone should give Sean some serious advices lol I thought the critics were harsh on him but at the same time funy, like the one that says dude needs to lay off Breaking Bad.</UTT>I thought advice is what he was seeking from Cohen?  Hahahahahaaaaaaaa</UTT>Lol, yeah apparently he should change counsel well with all that he said he will definetely do that.</UTT>Seriously... a Donkey Kong scandal... UGH!!!</UTT>Yeah, so I just heard about this scandal on the radio, do you like listening to the radio?</UTT>I listen to Sirius radio.  Do you?</UTT>Me too, on the way to work, you know Jupiter has rario storms that can be picked up by an AM radio</UTT>That's cool, I wonder what it sounds like?</UTT>Im guessing just about any other AM radio, would be interesting to listen but boring after a while</UTT>This is true!  That's too funny that in canada 40% of music has to be canadian.  You imagine that law in the US... people would revolt!</UTT>Yeah, people revolt for less so I can imgine it for sure lol, and I think its a great law, supports local talent</UTT>I totally agree.. but you could never get away with it!</UTT>Yeah I guess your right, there is a site with thousands of drama episodes and all for free you should really look this website up.
t_b5ab849c-5e31-49c0-a785-107d79ddaeaf</CONV>Hello, do you know kim kardashian?</UTT>I am aware of that person but could tell you little else about her.</UTT>Apparently,  she used to be Paris Hiltons personal assistant.</UTT>She must have learnt everything she know from Paris.  I'm a little vague on what it is she does right now.</UTT>I am not sure as well.  Her family has a show keeping up with the kardashians and she is married to kanye west.  She might not do anything really.</UTT>Do you think they both purposefully went the route they did to get famous on purpose?</UTT>lol probably.  Anything to get famous I guess.  It's really sickening that her family and herself have had so much fortune and success and it seems like they dont do anything.  I have never seen their show or bought any of their products,  I dont want to contribute money to them.</UTT>You and me are on the same page here.  The whole reality TV thing is scrapping the bottom of the barrel.  Have you heard of the Bad Girls Club show?</UTT>No I never heard of it.  Another reality show,  rewarding bad behavior?  lol</UTT>I don't really get what the point of the show was other than to show some women being mean to each other.</UTT>Sounds dumb lol I dont know why shows like that make so much money,  something is wrong with america lol I understand if its actors and fiction like a show or movie,  but these producers are encouraging these women to talk about each other,  ridiculous.</UTT>On these shows people just go over the top to get screen time.  They don't really act that way, but everyone has to out do the other and be more shocking.  The more shocking you are the better.</UTT>Yeah,  Ive seen like a documentary on it,  the producers encourage them to act like that.</UTT>So I guess one of these people went too far and starting committing crimes.  Stealing a dead man's identity!</UTT>Oh that,  yes I recently read about it.</UTT>My understanding is that she acted as an escort, and when the guy died from an overdose she kept his debit cards and used them for her own means after his death.</UTT>Yeah,  pretty scandalous!  Geez I cant believe what some people will do.</UTT>I think we should forget about these people.  Here's something positive instead, UNICEF will donate a day of clean water for each minute you don't use your phone.  That feels better.</UTT>Thats amazing!  I hope that I contribute to that,  I dont really use my phone that often lol Definitely a positive story!</UTT>I just wonder how they would monitor it, I suppose it would have to be on the honor system?</UTT>hmm not sure.  its been great chatting though,  have a good one.
t_f5623f01-7a13-4908-a545-408dbd847c26</CONV>Are you into rap? I don't know much about the genre.</UTT>No. I don't like it. I think it is cool that the origins of rap are from West Africa.</UTT>I'm not surprised that the genre made its way from Africa to the US. And now it's moving from the US around the world, in every language.</UTT>Yes. It seems to be going everywhere, even Tupac's music made into the Library of Congress.</UTT>I heard that Tupac danced ballet in high school. I would have expected him to be a dancer, but not that kind. The guy was really talented.</UTT>I really would not have expected it either but many singers are multitalented-like J Lo, they do movies. Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. Go figure.</UTT>Speaking of soundtracks, the one for the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" has gone multi-platinum.</UTT>Wow, I didn't know that. I've seen that movie and it deserves some attention. Did you know that Bruce Lee was also a great dancer?</UTT>Yeah, I heard that he was good. Didn't he win a contest in Hong Kong? Probably being good at dance helps with martial arts and vice versa.</UTT>Yes he did win the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958.</UTT>I wonder how old he was. I know that babies respond to music by dancing. It's an instinct and yet I can't dance at all.</UTT>Yes and babies smile more when they hit the beat. :]</UTT>I guess classical music isn't so good for babies when they want to dance! Have you heard of Daft Punk?</UTT>They sound vaguely familiar. What soundtrack or movie did they do?</UTT>They wear robot helmets. They did the Tron Legacy soundtrack.</UTT>I haven't seen Tron Legacy. Do you remember when Phil Collins did the Tarzan soundtrack?</UTT>I never saw Tarzan. Is that an animated feature?</UTT>Yes, it is. It is a Disney movie circa 1999. Very good movie. Did you know that Phil Collins recorded that soundtrack in 6 different languages?</UTT>Wow! I guess he has a good ear for language. I should check out Tarzan, the English version of course.</UTT>Yes, it is funny if you are a Disney fan. Say, did you see Michael Jackson do the "exteme lean" in some of his dance moves. I wonder how he did it.</UTT>He copied it from someone else who had used special shoes to lock into bolt heads in the stage floor.
t_d8d7d733-e3a0-4fc3-a6b2-25e856314ebe</CONV>Hi, are you an Ariana Grande Fan?</UTT>I am not but I do not hate her. What about you?</UTT>I had no opinion on her, but feel somewhat negative towards her after her accusation of another singer using bots to boost ratings.</UTT>I am a 40 year old male and feel I have lost all touch of modern music. I am not proud of that but it is reinforced every year I watch the VMAs.</UTT>That is fair, Ariana definitely seems to be solidly a modern artist like you said, especially in a culture where being on top of the charts seems to be more important than anything.</UTT>So who is your favorite artist?</UTT>My favorite artist is Kanye West, who ironically enough is also represented by Ariana's agent. What about yourself?</UTT>I have been into jazz recently. I have found a lot of contemparary artists that have kept me happy.</UTT>That's fair, it's certainly a more artistic music form. Do you ever listen to rap?</UTT>I do once in a while. I couldn't stop listening to Kendrick Lamar's latest when it came out.</UTT>True, I think he's very talented. In general rap is a very historied genre. Did you know Tupac's music is in the Library of Congress?</UTT>No, I didn't know that. I did know that The world's fastest english language rapper, noclue, can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second.</UTT>That's very impressive for sure. Rap is also intresting to me because of controversy. For example, Eminem was tried, and the judge even delivered her ruling in the form of a rap.</UTT>Donald glover got his rapper name 'childish gambino' from an online wu-tang clan name generator. What would yours be?</UTT>I'm not sure, but that's interesting, lot of rappers get influence from seemingly random sources. I know Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist before rapping.</UTT>Jason paige the singer of the pokemon theme is also the rapper on "black and white" by michael jackson. Thats so weird!</UTT>It's amazing how many side ventures artists get into! Busta Rhymes also voiced a character in the Rugrats movie, aside from rapping.</UTT>I remember that. There is a deaf rapper named signmark who rhymes in sign language.</UTT>That's very interesting, I'm sure a show would be fun to watch. Do you see movies often?</UTT>Not really... you?</UTT>Somewhat! In general I find the box office interesting, I didn't know Tom Hanks was the highest all-time box office star.</UTT>Nice chatting with you.
t_d978445f-c384-46d9-a318-7c5c99cef32d</CONV>Hey there. You ever ride horses? I have in the past. I have also seen a Lipizzaner show, they give the classical dressage performances.</UTT>I have never had the chance to ride a horse. It looks fun. What is Lipizzaner?</UTT>You should try! It is a show performance horse! Very pretty. Icelandic horses have a fifth speed called tolt, but most horses have 4 speeds.</UTT>Four speeds? I didn't know that. I guess each speed is for a different purpose.</UTT>Yeah exactly. Clint Eastwood rode a lot of horses in his movies but he ended up being allergic to them! That would make riding tough.</UTT>I wonder how that happened. I guess the immune system gets confused.</UTT>Yeah it's odd how allergies can be developed at anytime. Dalmations are associated with fire fighters because apparently they would calm and protect the horses back in the day!</UTT>I guess with the noise and the flames, the horses could become nervous. The dogs probably were probably calm and helped the horses become calm.</UTT>Yeah good point. Do you use google very often? A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong to the moon!</UTT>I use Google. I guess that power could come in handy when I go to the Moon next.</UTT>Haha yes I would love to go to the moon too. At the google headquarters they use live goats to trim their lawn!</UTT>If the goats get stock options, sign me up. I can eat grass. I'm not proud.</UTT>Haha. Well you will never starve that's for sure. Do you have an android? Google maps calculates traffic by how fast android devices are moving.</UTT>I don't like that google tracks everything. Where I am, what I'm searching for.</UTT>Yeah they don't have the word privacy in their dictionary. They are powerful though. When there is a disputed border google maps tailors its maps to claims of each country.</UTT>I guess that is helpful for border disputes. I would like them to think about the little guy, the individual.</UTT>Yeah me too. It seems like they just care about making money. Do you like dancing? I don't very much but Bruce Lee was apparently a great dancer and was a champion dancer in 1958.</UTT>I bet he was! Tremendous body control. I guess he also had a sense of rhythm. A real ladies' man.</UTT>Yeah no doubt all the ladies loved him! I always wonder how Michael Jackson was able to do that lean move. Apparently he has a patent on the device which allowed him to do it (RIP Michael).</UTT>Those shoes were really cool. He knew how to pull off an illusion.</UTT>That's for sure. Tupac was also a ballet dancer in high school. I never would have guessed that because he never rapped about it!</UTT>He probably didn't want that fact getting out. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting!</UTT>You as well! Even babies can dance lol. Have a good day!
t_03e7fe78-b4b6-45ca-a66e-c065f4be68f1</CONV>do you like horror films? I guess Stephen King considers Bambi to be a horror movie, I never would have guessed that!</UTT>Hello there, really? I wonder why he would have ever said that.</UTT>ya, have you seen it? Like it's sad but not a horror movie to me, more like a sad one though haha</UTT>I think I have but when I was really young.  Do you know how they make the majority of metallic noises in horror movies?</UTT>haha no I don't how do they do it? some kind of weird instrument?</UTT>Yeah I guess it is called a waterphone.  Sounds like a pretty crazy instrument to me.</UTT>ya I need to look up what that sounds like, also I shoudl watch more horror movies apparently you can burn almost 200 calores from watching one, that would help me lose weight!</UTT>Yeah I guess they must get your heart racing pretty fast!  What are some of your horror favorites?</UTT>Well I like The Shining, I like Nightmare on Elm Street, and Halloween is a classic, what about you?</UTT>Yeah good call, the Shining is one of the best ever.  Halloween is a good one too and so is Nightmare.  I really like Rosemary's Baby, have you seen that one?</UTT>no I haven't, what is that about? I have heard of it but I haven't seen it yet</UTT>It is really good, it is about a wife who gets set up by her husband and she gives birth to the devil basically.</UTT>haha oh wow, well you like the shinning, its good to know that Danny from the movie didn't realize he was making a horror movie at the time, that could have scarred him for life!</UTT>Yeah I think that is pretty funny though.  I wonder what kind of movie he thought he was gettin into?</UTT>haha ya I wonder if they shot the scenes out of order or told him lies to keep it so he didn't know what he was diong haha</UTT>Yeah I think you might be right about that. On a different note, are you a user of Amazon?</UTT>ya I like to buy stuff from there, I don't have prime anymore i didn't use it enough, what about you?</UTT>Yeah I use them quite often, especially around the holidays.  Do you know what the first ever amazon purchase was?</UTT>no I don't! I do know the guy would bought the first item got a building named after him though, what was it?</UTT>Yeah good call! I guess he paid $27.95 and got a building named after him yeah.</UTT>I mean it is cool to get a building named after you, but it would have been cooler to get something physical, really anything, instead of that haha but thats just me
t_383955c2-4d99-4d78-bcab-c0b705fa084a</CONV>Do you like to read?</UTT>Yes, I love to read! Do you like to read?</UTT>I do when I have the chance. Luckily it's not the 18th century where there was a fear of the spread of reading of novels. It was a moral panic.</UTT>Isn't that scary! I'm glad its the modern times. I know getting free time to relax and read is hard to get some times.</UTT>Yeah, it is, but maybe I would have more time to read if I could speed read like Anne Jones, who can read 4700 words per minute.</UTT>I know that is unreal. How can you understand what you're reading at that speed?</UTT>I know, I wonder how they verified that she was actually reading. Perhaps comprehension questions?</UTT>Could be, that would be alot of them. Have you read the Ender's game book? I think there was a movie. I have not seen it though. Its on the read list from the military.</UTT>I have not read that. Starship troopers is also on the reading list of some military branches.</UTT>Yes, that looks like a good read.  I wonder why Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the bible?</UTT>I'm not sure. I wonder how he thought about kids learning the bible at school.</UTT>I don't know? Teddy Roosevelt and John Adams are the only two presidents that did not use the bible for swearing-in. I think they used the constitution instead.</UTT>Interesting! I wondered about Jefferson because before 63 it was not uncommon for students to be required to read the Bible as part of their elementary education.</UTT>That is interesting. Apple in latin is called malus.</UTT>I guess it means both apple and evil!</UTT>Yes, I didn't know that! Its good to know there is 3g cell service on the top of Mt Everest!</UTT>Ha, so I guess it is difficult to escape from technology. There is also a copy of the internet in case the internet burns down.</UTT>Yes, That's a good idea! I believe its true that only 7% of people read the full terms when buying a product.</UTT>Wow, I think I am one of them.</UTT>I am too, they make it so long and difficult to read. Who knows what's in there? Scary. Did you know the menu button is also called the hamburger button?</UTT>I have never heard of it being called that!

t_a81ac998-db68-4ef7-a654-32c3afa2c582</CONV>I always enjoy reading about people's idea of a dream day. Sometimes it gives me ideas of things to do.</UTT>That is an interesting article, so many things to do at the D.C area</UTT>Yeah, most of it didn't sound fun to me but the menu ideas sounded amazing.</UTT>I agree, have you been to the D.C area before?   I would like to go to the Natural History Mesuem, that seems like a great place</UTT>No, I never have. Never been east of the Mississippi. Have you been to DC?</UTT>I have been to D.C  I think its a great place, what would you like to do there?</UTT>Probably just check out all the standard touristy stuff LOL. I'd like to see the Library of Congress, but I'd wind up living on the streets there just to have continuing access to it. What did you do?</UTT>That doesnt sound like a fun activity lol, I would like to try one of those sweet caffeinated drinks</UTT>Yeah, I'm not sure what she was talking about because I never tried Starbucks tea. Sounded like ordering two drinks and mixing them together. Also the seafood sounded amazing -- especially the calamari.</UTT>Those dishes sound great, I would like to try them out as well, the cuisine in the area must be one of the best in the whole country</UTT>Probably. They say DC used to be a backwater compared to New York, but since it expanded so much after WWII it's probably a lot better.</UTT>it must be a lot better by now, so do you like fantasy?</UTT>Not really -- I like some of the usual children's fantasy lit that's popular among adult stoners like Lewis Carroll and Kenneth Graham LOL, but mostly sci-fi. How about you?</UTT>I do, I like fantasy movies and also games, a janitor from Chicago wrote a 15000 page fantasy manuscript!!</UTT>I wonder if it was any good.</UTT>I bet a few pages were, too bad it got discovered after his death</UTT>I should Google to find out more about it. It would be nice if it got published.</UTT>Maybe it is, who knows movies might be inspired in his masterpiece, 15000 pages is a lot,</UTT>Yeah, that's not a "novel" -- it's a whole series!</UTT>Yeah a whole series I agree, he must had invested a lot of time in it</UTT>Must've been his secret life away from work. Nice chatting with you!
t_3ca2fc0e-4821-46b3-9244-c908be0183f3</CONV>hELLO</UTT>Hi there!</UTT>Did you know that on april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead.</UTT>Really, wow! I wonder how many people had TV then?</UTT>Good question.  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude</UTT>cool! ever hears of Eurovision?</UTT>No, what's that?</UTT>Song Contest in england.</UTT>Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain's highest mountain and found a piano</UTT>neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle.</UTT>An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds.</UTT>Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years.</UTT>When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for "beat it" he literally set the studio speakers on fire.</UTT>Oh my gosh! DO you like Jazz?</UTT>No, not really.  You?</UTT>Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans.</UTT>There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.</UTT>I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression,</UTT>A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by.</UTT>Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.</UTT>Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.</UTT>Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby.</UTT>Clint Eastwood movies are awesome</UTT>they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave?</UTT>That's great one.  Unforgiven was awesome</UTT>I'll have to look that one up! Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing.</UTT>I didn't realize that.  That's very interesting.  Thanks for the chat.</UTT>You too! Have a good day!</UTT>Thanks have a great day as well</UTT>Matthew bellamy from the band muse holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed on a tour.

Do you like Jim Carrey?</UTT>I do. Did you know he does not do dramas anymore?</UTT>Yes because he thinks that they do no portray positivity</UTT>Yeah. Do you listen to radio dramas?</UTT>I do sometimes. There is a website where you can listen to them for free</UTT>Yeah. Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?</UTT>Yes he was chasing the pretty girls and they were in drama class</UTT>Yeah what a guy. Do you like Jon Hamm?</UTT>Yes he is so funny. He used to be a drama teacher in a high school once</UTT>Yes and one of his students was Ellie Kemper</UTT>Yeah small world. Do you use YouTube?</UTT>Yes all the time. It is the second largest search engine anyways</UTT>Yeah. Do you know which is the most disliked video in there?</UTT>Yes it is Baby by Justin Bieber, crazy.</UTT>I know. Do you know why they increased the view count?</UTT>Because Gangnam Style song became so popular</UTT>Yeah Have you heard of Bluetube?</UTT>Yes that is the police youtube pretty cool. Nice chat
t_9feb616c-bce3-4cf7-8d17-1ebb2df1c13f</CONV>What do you think about the tweet the Russian Embassy posted?</UTT>It is kind of fun.  Emoji of a space ship and some photo.  Not serious at all.  Twitter is not meant to be serious.</UTT>Yeah I guess Twitter is informal but it can have serious repercussions still.</UTT>There are a lot of reasons for a helicopter to be around DC.  The DC police had one up for a possible robbery.  I guess it could be real event taken the wrong way. Serious it is.</UTT>It seems a bit too unrealistic to me lol like a Tom Clancy novel.</UTT>Yes, like a novel. Did you know that the Russian Foreign Ministry put a april fools joke on the answering machines... Press 3 to request election interference. Thats a good one.</UTT>It didnt sound like the Russian foreign ministry is full of surprises,</UTT>Oh Russians, always having fun.  Not like in the US where a cat named Hank was running in the Virginia Senate Election.  He got third.</UTT>Thats too bad I was cheering for Hank, probably would have done a better job than most politicians.</UTT>The cat would have been cool!  It is a odd thing how how we pick elected officials.  Apparently the faster blinking person has lost every presidential election since 1980.</UTT>I bet thats a signal our subconcious picks up, you know that the Iphone has more computing power than the us nuclear icbm detterrent all combined!!</UTT>I wonder how that can be.  It is no small feat to hit a moving target with a missile.  Let alone a few hundred targets.  I belive the Iphone thing.  There is little correlation between cellphone call quality and the bars of service.</UTT>I know I would have thought it required something a lot more powerful than an Iphone and I wonder why is that</UTT>I do not know.  Perhaps that rule that says computing power doubles and cost halves very year.  I have a fun piece of trivia about phones.  The dial phone was created because an business thought the operators were routing calls to competitors.</UTT>Oh how interesting, I have one for you too, do you know why the area code of New York is 212?</UTT>I would guess that the early idea was numbers like 313, 414.  NY was first, so 212.  In 1930's an actress helped invent cell phone wifi and gps.  way to go Hedy Lamarr.</UTT>No, the correct answer is because it was the fastest number to dial back when rotary phones were used.</UTT>Well, that sounds reasonable.  No idea why or how such things happen.  Kind of like the Hedy bit of trivia.</UTT>Yeah I guess its just  because of coincidences of life, kind of like why the guest house of the current president can be bigger then the White House.</UTT>The white house has some thick walls.  Ha.  Lincoln was the first president to have a photo taken for inauguration.  Want to know the freaky part?</UTT>Yes please tell me, I am intrigued!</UTT>In that Lincoln photo was John Wilkes Booth.  Always a bad sign when you have three names.</UTT>Oh, I bet Lincoln didnt know the guy next to him was going to eventually kill him.
t_7130d77b-7b11-45ff-90ee-a02834ec387f</CONV>Do you enjoy watching films or tv?</UTT>I love watching films but not so much tv</UTT>What genre do you enjoy? I like horror films</UTT>I do not like horror films.  I actually do watch some saturday night live.  i love the skits, but I miss the old school cast.</UTT>Unlike most genres, horror films are usually a hit or miss for me. I feel that horror is a very subjective thing</UTT>I understand what you mean about horror films.  I feel like momento was intended to be a horror film, but turned out to be an intellectual and interesting film not so much horror.  So I agree they are hit or miss.</UTT>Did you know in some films, the actors themselves didn't know they were performing in a horror movie?</UTT>I have read that, but I didn't know before reading the knowledge.  I also read that some movies were thought to be scary, but ended up being horror.  that seems crazy.</UTT>I mean I can see why stephen king would be terrified of bambi considering that if you don't gloss over that it is a disney film, it is quite dark</UTT>A lot of the disney movies are scary and dark.  The wicked stepmother who locks Cinderella up in the tower.</UTT>Well a lot of them are toned down versions of their german counterparts</UTT>Interesting.  I didn't know that.  Where did you learn that information?</UTT>I learned it in high school. For instance, since the stepsister's feet were too big to fit in the glass slipper, one girl cut her heel and the other her toe to fit</UTT>Wow.  That feels like a horror movie to me.  And so dark and depressing.  Thanks for telling me that.  I think I'll stick to my romcoms.</UTT>Well even though it is a bit dark, I think it is interesting to learn the origins of all the disney classic</UTT>I agree.  I just had no idea that was where that came from.  I feel like those could be categorized as a horror movie that wasn't supposed to originally be considered a horror movie.</UTT>True. Like I said, I feel most of what we consider to be horror movies are highly subjective</UTT>Have you seen any other horror movies as of late?  I feel like every other commercial is some crazy horror movie including kidnapping or some other craziness.  I recently saw a movie ad about an older woman who acts nice and then tortures people.  I think it was called Greta.</UTT>I saw the elevator. it is an old horror movie that was so bad it is better know as being hilarious</UTT>Well I try to steer clear of horror movies altogether.  I remember watching Halloween in high school and practically throwing up.  And that movie was so ridiculous.  So It's better for me to watch fluffy movies or dramatic movies.  Nice talking with you.</UTT>The same to you.
t_728fe1b4-5587-41a1-928f-bc8285bc5939</CONV>Hey do you think Kobe Bryant is going to play in the Big 3 League next year</UTT>I hear that he may now but I can't imagine that.</UTT>Yeah he's getting pretty old, I think he should just give it all up honestly. What do you think? also do you ever watch the NBA</UTT>You're probably right. I watch occasionally.</UTT>What's interesting to me is there is only one Canadian NBA team, I wonder why that is</UTT>I didn't realize there was one. I guess I didn't think about it being the National Basketball Association. If it's northern Canada that's a lot of travel for games.</UTT>That's true but if they have a demand for a team they should put a team up there somewhere, it's interesting that the NBA's located in New York-New York, I never knew that</UTT>I did not either. Are you familiar with Reggie Miller?</UTT>Yes I've heard of them. Wasn't his younger sister really good at basketball too? She would constantly beat the record that he set</UTT>She was. In high school she overshadowed him. She broke 8 national records!</UTT>Amazing! What do you think about Allen Iverson by the way he makes almost $800,000 every year from Reebok alone</UTT>I heard about that. And that's only until age 55 and then he gets a lump sum of $32,000,000!</UTT>Yep he's not going to any problems with money. What do you think about shooting granny style by the way? If you want to pay me 32 million dollars I will definitely shoot granny style all night long LOL</UTT>I did hear that it's actually the most effective way to score points on the line. I would use the most effective method regardless of how it looks.</UTT>Yep I would too. What about Air Jordans have you ever worn those before? Apparently they were banned by the NBA initially</UTT>I have not. I do know that Jordan wore them anyway and Nike paid his fines. It seems to have worked out for them.</UTT>Yeah I think that was the right move. I don't think it was the right move for Tim Duncan to delay playing for the NBA though, he stayed in college to get his degree which cost him money</UTT>But thankfully he still got to play after so he got his education and a career in the NBA.</UTT>Well that is one way to look at it. How often do you use the internet by the way? Do you know what the hamburger button is</UTT>I use the internet constantly but I have never heard of a hamburger button. What is it?</UTT>Well it's a button that looks like three horizontal lines, normally it is used for menus, I think Reddit uses it actually
t_6984f55b-aba5-41c6-b07c-caf0d625ec8b</CONV>Hello,  do you know much about cinematography?</UTT>Not really, I'm an avid movie watcher. I have heard of Roger Deakins who constantly is getting nominated for awards.</UTT>Oh ok,  I havent heard of him. Thats great though,  hes been nomiated  times.</UTT>Do you like visiting D.C.?  They have over 250 restaurants and a Summer Restaurant Week.</UTT>I have never been there. I did read that recently.  Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for the academy award for best cinematography?</UTT>That will probably change soon.  I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was involved with Spartacus.</UTT>Me either.  do you like comedy?</UTT>Yes.  I can't believe the Green Lantern was going to be a comedy with Jack Black!</UTT>Yeah thats weird!  Not sure it woldve made it better though lol</UTT>Couldn't have hurt much. :) I was surprised to know that the Python programming language was, in part, named after Monty Python.</UTT>Yeah thought that might have been a coincidence.  I guess comedy central has not been doing great,  It has cancelled over  shows!</UTT>That or they're picky.  Bill Murray isn't so picky.  He thought the "Kung Fu Hustle" was super great.</UTT>It was a great movie!</UTT>I am an amatuer astonomer and Jupiter's moon Ganymede fascinates me since it is big enough to be a planet.</UTT>That is really big!</UTT>Another one is that Uranus is actually rotating on its side.  Many think it was involved in a major collision.</UTT>Oh thats interesting.  and the accident threw it off axis?  If it rotates on its side,  does that mean there is an area that doesnt get any sun?</UTT>Yeah, the sunlight is in weird time patterns on the poles. I guess the building blocks of life (e.g., RNA) have been detected on a planetary system 455 light-years away.</UTT>Do you know what planet it is where shards of glass rain sideways in 2000 degress fahrenheit?</UTT>I would guess one of the outer ice planets - probably Neptune.  Venus doesn't have seasons or that kind of wind.</UTT>interesting,  thanks.</UTT>Thank you.  You were a great chat partner.
t_91251d47-4099-4c02-b70f-80ab624387fb</CONV>Have you played any model of Playstation?</UTT>I used to play the original playstation. What about you?</UTT>I've played them all. I enjoy them. Playstation 3's are currently being used to research black holes. I wonder how that works?</UTT>I am not sure. Do you play often?</UTT>I do between my Playstation and XBox. Did you play the PS2 at all?</UTT>I think I had that one... I did not play much. Even in college I did not play a lot. I played a ton when I got my first job and moved in with my gaming friends. We played all the time. Left the bars early to play...</UTT>It is very fun. The last game for the PS2 was FIFA 14. It became the first game to span 3 console generations.</UTT>Wow, I had no idea! Seems like a good game to do that with. FIFA is crazy popular!</UTT>It definitely is. The department of defense also used 1760 playstation 3's to build a supercomputer. They are finding all kinds of uses for consoles.</UTT>That's crazy! PS2 is the best selling consoule to date. That just seems right.</UTT>I believe that is because it had a DVD player. It was the first DVD player for most people I know because there was not much of a price difference between it and a regular DVD player at the time.</UTT>One of my room mates bought a PS4 because it was also a blu ray player and he wanted a new blu ray. He also played that consoule all the time!</UTT>Makes sense. We use ours for a lot of media. Do you also watch a lot of television. I watch way too much.</UTT>I am trying to cut out uneccesary TV from my life. I still watch it but am choosing some more worthwhile endevours. What shows do you watch?</UTT>Lots. Currently binging The Punisher. Did you know there is only one episode of The Simpsons where Bart does not appear and is not mentioned?</UTT>I did. It is the 4 women and the manicure. Good episode. I heard they canceled the Punisher on Netflix.</UTT>I had not heard that yet but I'm positive it's going to happen because they are slowly cancelling all of the Marvel shows since the Disney merger. Another Simpsons fact, they sent flowers to the South Park crew when South Park aired it's Family Guy episode which is very funny.</UTT>Wow. Do you watch the family guy or south park? Do you enjoy cartoons?</UTT>Yes I watch both. But they were spot on with their criticism of Family Guy.</UTT>I did not watch that one. what was the criticism about?</UTT>How Family Guys jokes are basically a series of flashbacks and they ripped off The Simpsons for their format.</UTT>Oh... Nice chatting with you!

Have you ever watched the variation that has three teams, instead of two?</UTT>Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.</UTT>I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery.</UTT>Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it "soccer" because it was slang for association football</UTT>I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69' US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that.</UTT>Seems like a huge expense lol</UTT>I didn't know the rapper Drake, was Canadian, did you?</UTT>Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an "obscene amount of money'' on first editions of children's classic books 'charlotte's web' and 'winnie the pooh'.</UTT>That's sweet, and it's interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED.</UTT>Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school.</UTT>Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem's verse.</UTT>Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive.</UTT>Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I've never heard of it.</UTT>I've heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?</UTT>I'm not sure, as I've never watched it, even though it was on for seven years.</UTT>The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.</UTT>That's funny, I bet he made their night. I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil' Wayne's label, instead of Dre's Death Row.</UTT>Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would've made a lot of money</UTT>I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it's also one of his most popular.</UTT>me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you
t_76d8a768-3cc6-4f54-a866-8c25a59d8998</CONV>Good morning!  Do you follow presidential history?</UTT>I don't know much but I find it very interesting, especially the crazy way elections used to work. Did you know that until the early 1800's the runner up in a US presidential election was appointed the vice president?! Awkward!</UTT>Could you imagine that happening now?  The top 3 wealthiest presidents in American history before Trump were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.</UTT>I wonder what the specific numbers on that are or how they compare with inflation. US presidents back int the day were usually all business men weren't they? Meanwhile the president of Indonesia is releasing pop albums haha</UTT>I think you are pretty correct - either businessmen or ex-military generals for the most part.  Makes you wonder what he got done in office if the Indonesian president had that much free time on his hand.   I like the name of the first president of Zimbabwe. They called him president Banana!</UTT>I wonder how president banana got that nickname. Do you think his name sounded like banana or that he really loved to eat them?</UTT>I'm thinking it probably sounded like it.  lol  Did you know that the US presidents guest house is larger than the white house?</UTT>That's so shocking to me! I would expect The White House will all the extra security and staff would be bigger. Maybe a smaller building is more secure?</UTT>That might be right.  I was wondering if maybe it was just to be more comfortable for visiting white house guests?</UTT>Do you think maybe white house guests are more used to staying in a palace or something enormous?</UTT>I'm sure they probably get treated top notch.  They're not staying at the Motel 6  LOL</UTT>I wonder if they have any special fun stuff in them, to accomodate the guests like a recording studio for the President of Indonesia</UTT>Hahaha Wouldn't that be funny?  Interesting piece of US senate history....the candy desk is a tradition of the US senate since 1968.  The desk is currently supplied by candy made in PA.</UTT>I've never even heard of this. Is it a lifesize  desk made of candy or a desk covered in candy?</UTT>It's a desk that the drawers are filled with candy.  I don't think they are as relevant as they used to be.  When I was a kid the secretary at my elementary school had a candy desk.</UTT>That's interesting is it there for visiting children or for the staff or what? I don't imagine there are quite as many tours of children going through the White House these days since the current president doesn't live there</UTT>I think they have it there more for show and a historical purpose type thing.  I seem to remember the candy desks going away at  schools in the early 80's when the generation that was into them started retiring.</UTT>It seems like the whole world has changed drastically since the late 80's. Did you know women weren't allowed to wear pants on the senate floor until 1993?</UTT>Yes!  I graduated in 89.  Seems like not much changed except the job economy has been a downhill slide since then.  I didn't know that!  What an odd law.</UTT>There's another weird senate law where the sergeant at arms can arrest absent senators and make them come to the chamber to vote. Once a guy tried to escape and they dragged him in by his feet! I hope the running was worth it to him!</UTT>LOL  That is a definitely a strange law.  I wonder how in the heck they came up with that?</UTT>My guess is that there was a run of low productivity and somebody got an aggressive bright idea haha</UTT>LOL That's funny!  I had fun chatting with you!  Hope you have an enjoyable day!
t_136f7370-3d1a-4cad-8f3d-c7e44a4c5267</CONV>Hi do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Hello, yes I do actually. Did you know Bill Murray voice the human torch in the fantastic four radio show?</UTT>Cool did not know that If you turn the radio to AM you might catch Jupiter's storms</UTT>Neat, I would like to hear that. There is a radio station that can translate solar activity to sound</UTT>wow cool. Do you know what foxholes are?</UTT>Hmm I am not sure, Foxhole radios were something of the past, were they not?</UTT>Yeah they were. They were radios that soldiers made using razorblades and pencils during WWII</UTT>WOw I wonder how that works actually. A hanson song once became the most popular one because the DJ's did not reveal the band</UTT>that is very creative of them. Do you ever listen to Canadian radios?</UTT>Hmm not a lot but sometimes. How about you?</UTT>I do osmetimes only. Did you know they are required to play 40% Canadian music?</UTT>Wow they must really want to support their local singers. Good for them, they have some nice up and coming singers too</UTT>Yeah that is true. Do you ever listen to radio dramas?</UTT>I cannot say that I do actually. Did you know one of the most popular radio acts was a ventriloquist back in 1970s?</UTT>WOw did not know that. Well if you ever want to there is a channels that broadcasts them for free</UTT>Oh that is nice, free on top of that. Do you know much about the presidents?</UTT>Hm I know some stuff, like  in Guatemala close family of the president are not allowed to run too</UTT>That is interesting. THe only US president that has had a PhD was WIlson</UTT>Yeah I guess you do not need one after all. DO you know who the wealthiest presidents are in us history?</UTT>I do not think I know that actually. I know LIncoln was the first president that was photographed for his inaguration</UTT>That is neat. It is Jefferson, JFK and Washington as the wealthiest three

What about you?</UTT>lol, I never knew that! I like watching baseball. Do you have a favorite team?</UTT>I like them all, really. So did you know baseball managers only wear uniforms because they can play for their team if needed? I'd love to see one of those old managers get out there and play. Ha!</UTT>That is awesome, I have seen it before on my old semi pro team I played on. The coach was 50 and we had too many hurt people lol</UTT>I bet that was a sight to see, wasn't it? Almost as fascinating as finding $3 million worth in 1900s baseball cards in your grandfather's attic like that one guy did. It must be nice!</UTT>Right! Talk about early retirement! Do you collect cards?</UTT>I should start, or at least check some attics. Ha! On a similar baseball note, can you believe the Japanese baseball fans were surprised to learn baseball is America's national pastime? The fact that it surprised them surprises me. Ha!</UTT>Right lol! I used to collect and had some good ones, never 3 milllion worth though! That surprises me too, how did they start the game since america invented it</UTT>I know, right? You'd think they would have known that! But then again, I didn't know until recently that a married couple scheduled all the 2430 games played for 24 years until 2005. That must have been a cool job!</UTT>I wonder how they got that job and why they shy'd away from it. That would be so fun!</UTT>Indeed it would! Can you imagine scheduling teams like the Cubs? That would be so cool. Speaking of the Cubs, it's shocking they haven't won a World Series since becoming the first baseball team to win back to back World Series'!</UTT>They won it a few years ago, but it took them like 100+ years to do it! Did you watch the world series this year?</UTT>I wasn't able to, sadly. I guess I'm part of the reason why the women's world cup had higher TV ratings in the US than the world series did.</UTT>me too lol! I followed it online mostly. did you hear how babe ruth lost the world series in 1926?</UTT>I did, actually! I heard he was caught stealing to end game 7 and his team was only down by one run. That had to have been so disappointing!</UTT>for sure, I am sure that is after they won a bunch of world series already, so probably showing off lol</UTT>Ha! Maybe so! But can you believe that the Marine corps carried the Canadian flag into the stadium upside down during the 1992 World Series? That's embarassing. Ha!</UTT>That would be so embarrassing lol, canada is too nice! It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>Indeed Canada is very nice! I personally think the entire planet would be nice if over 80% of the natural forests hadn't been destroyed. That's so heartbreaking! Well it was nice chatting with you as well! Hope you have a great day, friend!</UTT>You too! Enjoy your weekend!

Have you ever seen the show Pokemon?</UTT>Yes. After second world war, the TV is well improved into black and white. TV is the primary medium for influencing the public opinion.</UTT>Did you ever watch tv when it was only black and white?</UTT>The early bulky and heavily cathrode ray tube is replaced with flat compact.</UTT>Yeah it sure was, I remember watching at a friend's house before they got a new tv.  I can still remember the first color tv at my folks house as well.</UTT>It is very interesting. Television using high-powered radio frequency transmitter to broadcast the signal of individual TV as receiver using antenna.</UTT>That is very interesting learning about the origins of television.</UTT>Due to the advance of the technology all the modified today we are using LED tv.</UTT>That is true, and they are just getting bigger in size each year as well.</UTT>Yes. Do you like live concert ?</UTT>I do enjoy going to live concerts but don't go as often as I would like, how about you?</UTT>I like Jazz type of concert which is originated in African - American communities of New Orleans. Jazz spread around the world as the America classical music.</UTT>Yeah jazz can be really fun to listen to.  I didn't know that, very interesting.</UTT>Cool Jazz developed the end of the 1940s, making pleasant and smooth sound for the pleasant person its the next step the Jazz musics.</UTT>That is true, do you know why jazz trumpeters started growing goatees?</UTT>Its very interesting its origin is before 18th century.</UTT>Wow, that is very interesting.  I know that Clint Eastwood is a lifetime jazz fan.</UTT>It is America classical music. Mostly it is like by very one. Teenager is very much interest in it.</UTT>That is also true.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you have a good day.
t_9cccf1dc-1e44-4757-b88d-9a0bd97ca7b5</CONV>Hi do you watch association football?</UTT>Yes I watch it sometimes. DO you know why it is called soccer here?</UTT>Yes it is actually just a slang that stuck around</UTT>Yeah. It is a sport that makes more than some other combined</UTT>Yeah there is a lot of money there. Did you know MEsut Ozil donated his winning one year from the World Cup?</UTT>Yeah and he helped 23 children with all that money, what a guy really</UTT>Exactly. Jon Stewart was also a soccer player and represented the US in the pan american games in brazil</UTT>Yeah he is pretty much everywhere. Did you know there is soccer with three teams</UTT>I heard there is such a variation but I have not seen that yet, must be interesting</UTT>I think so too. Do you know what Wikileaks is?</UTT>Yes, that is the website that puts on display all the secrets of the government</UTT>Yes and once they published documents that showed how the government was planning to destroy them</UTT>Wow amazing. Did you know the government own 86% of the land in Nevada</UTT>I wonder what they do with all that land though and it is all desert</UTT>True, good point. A man in France once managed to sell the Eiffel tower twice.</UTT>Yeah he must have been really good at impersonating government officials</UTT>It seems that way. The Norwegian government has donated $1 billion to save the amazon rainforest</UTT>That is impressive. Do you use Google or another search engine?</UTT>I use Google actually. Do you know how they calculate traffic?</UTT>Yeah they take the average of the Android devices as they move in traffic</UTT>Yeah, pretty neat.
t_d43f5dd8-6bb1-47f2-a976-b31f5de625b6</CONV>Do you like Republicans?</UTT>Which Republican? I've had a few friends that said they were Republican. I'm an Independent.</UTT>Oh cool, Im independent too!</UTT>The Republican party use to be very different.</UTT>Yes the GOP, Grand Old Party</UTT>Lincoln was a Republican</UTT>Did you know that every president with a beard has been republican?</UTT>I've read that. They must of all been hipsters. LOL</UTT>Also, the consistent use of red and blue only started in 2000</UTT>I know. It seems to have been like that forever.</UTT>Right!  Did you know the presidential guest house is bigger than the white house?</UTT>I've heard that. I have been to the White House when Clinton was in office. Never the guest house.</UTT>Cool, I saw him at a conference once.  Personable guy!  Did you know the president of zimbabwe was called banana?</UTT>I've read that. I wonder why?</UTT>Me too.  Did you know the president of indonesia is a pop artist?</UTT>I did but never heard the songs.</UTT>I think he release 3 full albums while in office!</UTT>He was a busy President.</UTT>For sure, nice talking to you, take care</UTT>It's been nice chatting with you too.</UTT>Take care
t_eb610f8b-7cae-4fe9-a9b9-536ef409b364</CONV>Hello did you know that 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?</UTT>I heard it but I'm skeptical.  That sounds far too high and what's the definition of "natural.</UTT>Not sure in this case.  When the earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours long!</UTT>That was 5.5 hours of sunlit hell in magma and lava.  Bummer, they are saying we will be out of helium by the end of the century.</UTT>Yeah that would be crazy. If earths history was represented as a 24 hour period,  humans would only represent 1 min and 17 seconds lol Its sometimes so surprising how small we are in the universe.</UTT>Yeah, the sheer distances give me that feeling. The UN actually has an official ambassador to ETs.</UTT>I read that,  that just covinces me more that we are not alone.</UTT>I don't remember Google going down for 5 minutes in 2013?  It took 40% of web traffic down.  I probably blamed my ISP.</UTT>That is crazy!  I bet people were so confused lol I dont remember it as well.</UTT>Wow, a single Google search requires more computing power than what it took to send Neil Armstrong and 11 others to the moon!</UTT>That is surprising!  Wow everytime I google search I could be sending someone to the moon instead lol</UTT>Ha.  I guess Google once used goats instead of people to mow the lawns.  I can't imagine what a hassle it would have been to manage all the goats.  They are mischievous creatures that eat EVERYTHING.</UTT>lol true,  thats the new thing in Caifornia now,  hiring goats to eat your lawn,  I see it everywhere,  I think its great as long as they are managed by someone lol</UTT>Recent readings have confirmed what I always suspected:  woman are more likely to own an iPhone.  I'm a dude and I've owned one.  Android now...</UTT>I had the iphone 4 a long time ago and now I have the android lol</UTT>It seems that with Apple, there are too many strings attached forcing you to use their stuff.</UTT>I know right,  all there stuff has to go together like you are hooked into buying everything they own.  Its really annoying</UTT>I guess that's why we went Android?  Funny Jobs switched iPhones during presentation because they would run out of power and RAM.</UTT>Lol right!  I love android its so simple.  Thats a fail lol it cant even last a presentation without running out of ram lol</UTT>I think the irreplaceable battery on iPhone hurt their market.  Funny Microsoft had funeral for the death of the iPhone when it launched their own line.</UTT>lol Nice!</UTT>I had a MS phone and it was really good but lack of available  SW kind of ruined it.</UTT>Sorry to hear.  its been great talking to you.
t_a0627da8-e009-4192-9591-60011df0ed18</CONV>U used to go to a lot of concerts. Do you enjoy concerts?</UTT>I used to like going, not so much anymore. I'm not a big crowd person. I did see Linkin Park back in 2001 one though. It was in support of Hybrid Theory. I heard they played over 300 concerts that year.</UTT>That's an insane amount of concerts. I can't imagine how exhausted you would be.</UTT>I can't either. I've heard that the Ramones played over 2,000 concerts. That's alot of concerts.</UTT>I would have loved to have seen that. I'm assuming a lot of those were at CBGBs.</UTT>I would have loved that too. I always wanted to go see a show a CBGBs back in the day.</UTT>It would have been a great experience. Did you know that there is an ancient roman amphitheater that is still used for concerts in Croatia?</UTT>I would love to see a concert there. It would be breathtaking.</UTT>It would be an experience for sure. Pink Floyd recorded a concert in an ancient theater in Pompeii but they did it with no audience.</UTT>I would love to have been a fly on the wall for that one.</UTT>Me too. Did you know that a lawsuit was filed against Creed due to a concert?</UTT>I heard about that. I guess it was a horrible one.</UTT>Yes it was so bad that four of the attendees sued them. That must be really horrible to make you want to go through that.</UTT>It must have been. I wonder if they won the lawsuit?</UTT>That's a good question. Off topic but I really enjoy clothes and I feel like your shirt is what stands out most in your wardrobe. Do you agree?</UTT>I agree, I have to wear polo shirts for work all the time. Did you know that they were originally invented for tennis?</UTT>I did not. I associated them with polo.</UTT>Yep, they were invented by Rene "The Crocodile" Lacoste and only later adopted by polo players.</UTT>That's very interesting. Did you know that there is a difference between button up and button down?</UTT>I did not, what is the difference?</UTT>Button down is where the collar tips are buttoned to the shirt and button up does not feature this. It was nice chatting with you.
t_d2eeaf09-21e1-43d2-a445-1c3c4788fc95</CONV>Hi there, are you a football fan?</UTT>I was a big fan, age and other concerns have made me stop and you? I was reading about Adrian Peterson.</UTT>Me too. I'm a Viking fan who is a bit conflicted about AP.</UTT>hahahah why?</UTT>He was really fun to watch before I learned about his child abuse story.</UTT>Wow, was he abused? so sorry about that.</UTT>No, he abused his son. He did play well last season though.</UTT>Wow! so terrible news. Perhaps he was abused, too. You know, those things happens as a cycle. I love quaterbacks, do you happen to have a favorite?</UTT>Favorite to watch might be Aaron Rodgers at his best. How about you></UTT>hahaha it was a long time ago Stabler, did you know him?</UTT>Was stabler a cowboy?</UTT>No, from the evil Oakland's Raiders, perhaps you are too young. I think they are the most important player in the game, well, as well as receivers, etc. etc.</UTT>Definitely. Crazy to think that Alex Smith worked to get a Masters Degree after getting a BA in just two years</UTT>He really worked hard. And he began working on a master´s degree!</UTT>Has to do something after football, and he broke his leg badly this year so he might be done.</UTT>Well, but sure he has a lot of money left. I never knew that the circular huddle was invented for a deaft quaterback, so the other team could not read his hand signals, cool!</UTT>Now they use both headsts and hand signals.</UTT>Did you know that the New Zealand's basketball team are nicknamed the "tall blacks"? I should google why later.</UTT>Maybe they are referring to coffee</UTT>You are right. I don´t know, I like to investigate things, I will do it later, reading that the inventor of basketball James Naismith is the only losing coach in Kansas History. Poor guy!</UTT>Interesting!
t_4d0b0fe3-4791-48c7-8589-e43da9de2141</CONV>Hey, did you know Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph?</UTT>I'd heard something like. Something about being frustrated by late fees. Serves Blockbuster right!</UTT>Yeah. They sure showed Blockbuster. That 40 dollar late fee sure turned into billions for Reed Hastings and the business.</UTT>I wonder whether Netflix is going to disappear like Blockbuster. What is going to replace streaming?</UTT>I don't know, but at the moment both Netflix and also youtube account for half of peak internet traffic for North America.</UTT>People love their video. Who needs a TV when you've got a phone.</UTT>True. Speaking of television, there are over 750 episodes made of pokemon.</UTT>I never watched it. Isn't it for kids? Are they still making that show? How many years has it been going?</UTT>It is an anime. Mostly for the kid age group, but has an older following as well. I like the Simpsons a little. There is only one episode of the simpsons where Bart never is mentioned or makes any kind of appearance.</UTT>I always thought Bart was annoying. I wanted to see more about Lisa. She's great! I prefer South Park overall though.</UTT>Yes, South Park is more interesting I think. Did you know that after South Park did its family guy episode finale, the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew?</UTT>I wonder what that was about. Why did they send flowers?</UTT>They sent them a letter saying, "congratulations on reaching 200 episodes, we already did it, twice" , it seems. They were very friendly with the crew. Too bad television has a lot of advertising, and makes it irritating to sit through programs at times.</UTT>That's why Netflix is great! Less advertising = more time watching what I want. I wish I had bought Netflix stock.The company is worth billions!</UTT>Me too. Blockbuster declined several different offers to buy Netflix for 50 million dollars.</UTT>I guess Blockbuster is down to its last store now. Netflix should buy it as a trophy.</UTT>Ha. What genre do you watch in movies? I sometimes like dramas.</UTT>I like thrillers and dramas. GoT is my go-to for fun. I've watched every episode like 5 times.</UTT>That is reallt popular. Do you know Drama comes from  a Greek word for 'action"?</UTT>I didn't know that! I've heard that the highest paid tv drama actor is a guy named Huge Lorry.</UTT>Yeah. He was in the show House. He was Dr. House. He made 700,000 a show.</UTT>$700 thou USD? He must be pretty good. I never seen the show. I prefer comedies to dramas.</UTT>The show has some comedy as well. Jim carrey stopped doing  drama because he doesn't want to play in a movie that isn't really positive.
t_9722477e-0c47-4828-8924-fae9b833e9f2</CONV>Did you know that putting dry tea bags in smelly shoes could help absorb odor?  I have some running shoes that may need that "tea treatment," no doubt.</UTT>I bet whoever first created the smell remover for shoes made a fortune like in the movie holes</UTT>Yes, that would have been a lucrative innovation.  Sometimes a bright idea like that can make someone more money than a lifetime career will; for example, not many people get rich teaching.</UTT>I mean especially if you make shoes for ballet dancers. Each pro goes through 4 pairs a week</UTT>Yes, that would add up over time.  Shoes sponsored by pro athletes are generally pricey as well.  One exception is the 15 dollar pair promoted by Stephon Marbury. Almost everyone could afford those.</UTT>Like jordans. While air jordan were initially banned by the nba, nike was more than willing to pay the fine for jordan to continue wearing them</UTT>Not a surprise; they were still making tons of money off of his name.  During his prime, he was on television it seemed like all the time.  Nike definitely knew how to appeal to the masses with him in its commercials.</UTT>It is ironic then that shoes 5000 years ago were better in performance than today's modern shoes</UTT>Ironic and somewhat sad.  And I'll bet early shoes didn't cost thousands of dollars a pair, or the ancient equivalent.  They were probably more for function than for fashion.</UTT>I wonder how they are better. In health? Energy?</UTT>That's a good question.  Maybe they perform better in regards to durability.  I'm not sure, but now I'm curious.</UTT>On a side note, how do you spend your time otherwise?</UTT>I like watching television when I get time.  South Park is a guilty pleasure and back in the day I loved The Simpsons.  How about you?  Any shows you hate to admit that you like or watch?</UTT>I have to concur. I also enjoyed the 70s show and the office</UTT>The Office was outstanding!  Such awesome satire.  Some people really like Family Guy as well, but I can understand why the South Park creators take shots at it sometime.  It's gotten stale over the years.</UTT>Was there any shows you watched in your youth like pokemon or thomas the engine?</UTT>No, I was more of a Looney Toons child.  But as an adult, I think it's cool that George Carlin narrated so many episodes of Thomas the Tank Engine.  Who would have thought the guy behind Seven words You Can Never Say on Television would be a part of a children's show?</UTT>Who is seven words you can never say?</UTT>It was a routine that George Carlin did a long time ago.  The seven words are the ones that can get you in big trouble if you say them on tv.  It was a hilarious routine, but if my mom had known I'd listened to it, she would have tanned my hide, no doubt.</UTT>That sound really interesting. I never knew. Anyway, I thank you for the enjoyable chat.</UTT>Thanks to you as well.  It was fun talking with you!</UTT>I hope you have a wonderful day.
t_22fb3201-d836-4ead-a10c-bac70f253f54</CONV>Hi. How are you ? Do you like comic books ? i very much do and my favorite ones are Marvel Comics</UTT>I am well, thanks! I have never really read comic books before but I learned recently that Marvel has been around since 1939 under the name Atlas Comics. I am more of a Netflix person myself haha.</UTT>Yes, Marvel has been around for a long time, i was surprised to find out that Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel in 2009. Oh, and i also enjoy Netflix very much</UTT>It's good to know that a third of the bandwidth in North America is during the 9 pm to 12 am time slot. I wonder if that impacts the user quality, I am not very knowledgeable in that area.</UTT>So does that means most people are up later at night watching Netflix,? I think it is really cool how netflix was created because of a late vhs fee ...lol</UTT>Yeah, I think so. I would wonder if I watched at 2 am if movies would glitch less. I seem to have that issue sometimes but it could be my internet connection. That is cool and I can totally relate. I am not exactly good at remember to return things right away and always end up incurring the dreaded late fee haha.</UTT>Back to the topic of comics, it seems like Netflix has many shows about superheroes or stories based off of popular superheroes which makes it even more popular in my opinion. Considering there are over 300 registered superheros in the USA alone, that is alot to entertain us with.</UTT>I find myself watching documentaries a lot but am looking for new movies to watch! I will have to check out some of the Stan Lee superhero movies like Batman or Superman. Which would you recommend? Normalman sounds kind of funny too.</UTT>I like the disney descendants which is more of a teen or family movie but as an adult i still enjoyed it. It is about the kids of the villians.  What about the garfield spinoff named per force ? Maybe you might like that too. There is so much to choose from. I have not seen Normalman but it sounds very interesting</UTT>That sounds good, and family-friendly as well. I loved Garfield!! I wonder if Netflix has the old episodes, reminds me of my childhood lol. I also think female superheroes are awesome, so maybe I'll have check out some of those ones too.</UTT>To answer your earlier question, i like Superman more than Batman. They are both good movies but Superman reminds me of my childhood and i love Christopher Reeves as Superman. Yes female hero are often called super heroine...i like wonder woman. That movie is on netflix</UTT>Is there a newer Wonder Woman? Thanks for the info! I will check out Superman maybe later today since I am having a lazy day. I am surprised but not surprised at the same time that netflix and youtube make up HALF of North America's internet traffic. People love watching stuff I guess!</UTT>Yes i think people like the ability to stream movies and videos anytime anywhere even on a cell phone, the technology has become so advanced that netflix and youtube are the modern day way to watch tv. i was surprised by how big Netflix is in other countries though I mean Wow , Their company  has offices in the Netherlands, Brazil, India, Japan, and South Korea.</UTT>Wow! That's pretty impressive, I wonder if that statistic applies across the world. Prob not though haha I can see why Netflix started offering everything online since they spend 20x more on postage than bandwidth!</UTT>i know, its a huge company. With 137 million total subscribers worldwide. I know other companies are starting to pop up now too such as Hulu..sling etc. but netflix is the best i think so far. so much better than renting videos.</UTT>Yeah, I have an Amazon Prime account so I watch on there too. It's crazy to think how much the world has changed in just the past ten years. I think that's when i got my first smartphone. 2009!</UTT>Is amazon Prime similar to netflix ? i thought Amazon Prime was just for shopping?</UTT>Yes! Well, there are a lot of different benefits that you get with the Prime account</UTT>Well I will certainly check out Amazon Prime, thanks for the tip. It has been a really nice and informative chat with you today. :)</UTT>I didn't mean to send that message so quickly, got a little click happy. I also subscribe to amazon Music but that's an extra fee every month unfortunately. Same to you, it's been nice talking with you. Have a nice rest of the day!</UTT>Thank you. Have a good Day. Enjoy your superman movies

I never knew that Bruce Lee was a great dancer. He won a Championship back in the 50s</UTT>Bruce Lee was known for inflicting lethal damage in the early rounds of a dance challenge. Competitors were hobbled and could not complete later rounds.</UTT>Haha they should make a movie about that. If only he weren't taken from us so soon. Did you know that ballet dancers can go through about four pairs of shoes a week</UTT>I would personally go through more because of my feet. I think ballet dancers must have the most hard-worked feet.</UTT>They do. I actually dated one and her toes were always super messed up.</UTT>Have you looked at the sun, I mean, *really* looked at it? The sun is actually white, only it looks yellow because of so-called atmospheric scattering I think there is something fishy going on there.</UTT>Wow I didn't know that. why don't they teach that in school. That would be actually useful to know haha. Also crazy is that a lightning bolt is hotter than the surface of the Sun</UTT>Lightning could be our source of energy for the future. Harnessing the lightning to save our planet.</UTT>I hope so. Or maybe it can help us to travel back in time with a flux capacitor haha. Did you know that Michael Jackson had a patent</UTT>Michael Jackson put a patent on being cool. What other patent did he have? Hyperbaric oxygen chamber?</UTT>Haha that's insane. He had a patent on that extreme lean movie that he made, there was like a device he created</UTT>Lean movie? I didn't know that he made a movie.</UTT>oh haha I meant lean move, did you know that babies will actually dance to music and dance to the beat of it</UTT>Can babies lean like Michael, even with special shoes? Probably not. Michael wins, just like Jackie Chan did.</UTT>I wish they could! He should have patented a baby leaning device haha also Tupac did ballet in high school. I wonder if anyone has tapes of that</UTT>Tupac probably bought and burned the tapes. 'Pac don't play dat.</UTT>Haha I like that. It's crazy that the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet our energy needs for 500,000 years. I hope we can Harvest that someday</UTT>Keep on truckin Brother. Patent a way to harness the lightning. Leave the sun for the next generation.</UTT>Haha good idea. Do you do anything with fantasy at all? Like fantasy football for instance

I don't like soccer though haha. What about you?</UTT>Why don't you like soccer? Too slow? Not enough blood? haha</UTT>Haha yes you could say that. I just think it's really boring haha. But to each their own, did you know that the top Bowlers in the 60s made more than the top football players back then</UTT>Bowlers were lucky that the NFL hadn't really appeared yet. TV could focus on bowling. Now, there's no way. Not enough blood and violence in bowling.</UTT>Yep I agree, watching bowling would even be worse for me than watching stalker LOL. Did you hear about the highest scoring football game ever?</UTT>I probably was like a bowling scores. That would be college ball, too. Lopsided teams?</UTT>I think the teams were definitely lopsided haha. Georgia Tech defeated Cumberland, it would have been really annoying to be a Cumberland fan that day LOL</UTT>I guess someone in scheduling really screwed up there. Why play such a good team? Silly.</UTT>Yep it doesn't seem fair. Do you ever watch football on TV though? You know the yellow line that marks the first down on TV broadcast? That was created by ESPN</UTT>I've seen that line, plus other things like field goal distance and red zone and stuff. I thought it would be obvious to add these things with computers.</UTT>Yep you think so. It does seem very obvious so I don't know why they won an Emmy, but I guess they did so oh well haha.</UTT>ESPN must be so proud of that award too. What will they do as a followup? Haha. Do you get a chance to do much reading?</UTT>I do some reading from time to time. I saw the movie Starship Troopers but never read the book. Apparently it's recommended reading from the US Military</UTT>Heinlein was the author. He was in the Navy, so he wrote a lot of books with a military theme.</UTT>Add that makes sense. Did you ever read the book Ender's Game? I heard that that was a good book, but I didn't like the movie Personally</UTT>The book was great! I didn't see the movie. I think some books just don't translate to the screen very well. The Tolkien books were pretty good on the screen, though.</UTT>Yep very few books end up transferring well to the screen, you're right. When you read do you speed read by the way?</UTT>No, not really a fast reader. I think it could be beneficial in some situations, though I wonder how much you retain.</UTT>Yep, I remember trying it and I couldn't retain anything, that's why I don't believe the world record. There's no way you could retain anything reading 4700 words per minute</UTT>I guess you get the gist, and that's enough for some things. But trying to learn complex material? No way.</UTT>Yep I think you got a point there. Did you hear there was a moral panic in the 18th century, there were too many people reading lol I guess that is not a big deal anymore

He puts words in peoples mouths like Macron on the european military.</UTT>Good, I agree with you lol, I didn't want to say I hated him and end up you liked him lol. He sucks, in my opinion.</UTT>No he is a complete joke, he is terrible and so are the morons that support him, seriously have to be the dumbest people. I hope he does not win in 2020, otherwise Im moving to New Zealand ha.</UTT>lol you sound like my brother matt, he would say the same thing and move to new zealand also.</UTT>Did you see the EU members and the multinational brigades/</UTT>Did you know Zimbabwe's president is nicknamed president banana?</UTT>That is crazy, do you know who Angela Merkel is, do you like Germany?</UTT>I just know we kicked Germanys butt in both ww1 and ww2</UTT>I wonder if Dee fought in WW2?</UTT>Dee who, a famous soldier? Trump?</UTT>Not sure of his name. I'm also not sure what branch he was in though.</UTT>never heard of that person, I will have to research him. Do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>Radio? Is that the technology that uses those crazy radio waves to carry information, like sound and stuff?</UTT>yes, crazy stuff. Radios in am mode can potentially pick up radio storms from jupiter!</UTT>Oh wow, I wonder what they would have to say about government, it is that system or group of people that govern an organized community, often called a state. I wonder if they have governments on Jupiter.</UTT>I think Trumps new Space force can bring democracy to jupiter and even mars</UTT>Not unless wikileaks publishes their plans to go there and colonize it. The US only brings democracy where there is oil, so I'm sure there is a ton there.</UTT>For sure, preach it! Did you know the government owns 86 percent of nevada. Must be doing some experimenting there</UTT>Is that the area called Area 69?</UTT>Yea, it is the cooler area 51. It was nice chatting with you!

Reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding sysmbols to derive meaning.</UTT>I really like reading. Did you know that Starship Troopers is on the reading list of 3/5s of the US Military Branches?</UTT>Its amazing. Now days reading is much reduced. People engaged in social media.</UTT>Technology has made me read me more. It's more convenient to use my phone and read.</UTT>Teenager mainly focused on social media. They don't read books and novel or newspaper.</UTT>Yeah that is true. Did you know that Cs Lewis and Tolkien held "you laugh you lose" competitions when reading terrible poetry.</UTT>There was "Moral panic" because of the spread of the reading of novels.</UTT>It seems there's always been a fear of people gaining knowledge.</UTT>Ender's game was suggested reading for many military organizations, including the united states marine corps.</UTT>I really liked that book. Did you know that the FDA burned six tons of literature in an act of US Censorship? That's crazy!</UTT>In 1953 Sir winston churchill won nobel prize and it was in literature.</UTT>That's pretty cool. I heard that Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were Olympic events from 1912 until 1952.</UTT>Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in electronic liteature.</UTT>That's kind of neat. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.</UTT>Literature, is any body of written works. Its used to depth of the knowledge and culture and people living its very interesting.</UTT>It was nice chatting with you.</UTT>Thanks</UTT>Have a good day.</UTT>There are more libraries than mcdonald's in the united states.</UTT>that's neat

How about you?</UTT>Yes I love dogs chimps and dolphins myself haha. I wish that dragons existed because I would love them too. Did you know there are 20 quintillion animals on planet Earth right now</UTT>That is a lot,  I dont even know what quintillion is lol Yeah I wish there wer dragons too,  miniature ones lol other than the kimodo dragon,  that thing is scary.</UTT>Yeah you're right I don't know how many zeros that is actually haha. It's crazy that animals can be millions of a meter up to about 30 meters long. I wish I knew more about animals. Then I would have started to become a zoologist</UTT>I wish I knew what meters is haha.  I hear theres a lawyer in switzerland that represents animals.  How can he do that?  Can he talk to them?</UTT>A great question. Also great question, Germany gave constitutional rights to animals. I wonder what those are. That was done in the year 2002</UTT>I didnt know animals have a dominent hand or paw.  ill have to see which one my dog uses more lol</UTT>Well I didn't know that. Do you know the story behind hiccups as well?</UTT>No whats the story with the hiccups?  Did you know there a type of lobster and jellyfish that are immortal?</UTT>That's pretty awesome! Although I would like to eat a lobster right now haha. And yes hiccups are a holdover from When Animals had both gills and lungs apparently</UTT>Oh right!  I wouldnt mind having gills if it meant I can swim longer and deeper though.</UTT>Wow that sounds awesome! Maybe we can both have y'all's and swim together haha have you ever seen the movie Waterworld though? They definitely hunt those people down haha can you believe that the Loch Ness monster has a special protection against it. The Scottish government did that back in 1912</UTT>Oh right waterworld that was a cool movie!  Yeah throw in some webbed feet too!!!!  That sounds good,  Id rather have gills and webbed feet than a tail lol</UTT>Sure that sounds awesome LOL. What about Facebook do you use Facebook at all? We need to make a Waterworld Facebook page with only Gill people</UTT>Yeah I used facebook!  we should see if there is one already,  that seems easier lol You never know..</UTT>Well apparently Iceland is rewriting their constitution on Facebook. So I think we should write a constitution for Gill people only</UTT>That probably saves a lot of paper for them!  Did you know there are more people on facebook that there were people in the world 200 years ago?</UTT>Wow that's crazy. What do you know about the Burger King Whopper promotion that they did on Facebook</UTT>I think they offer a whopper for unfriending people.  Is their friendship worth a whopper?</UTT>Haha yep that's what it was. You would have to unfriend 10 people though. I can definitely find 10 people I would unfriend though</UTT>lol well its been great talking,  have a good one.
t_1408914a-174f-4ae0-9509-bb6e30d4b138</CONV>have you had someone put a lighter near your ear to heal an earache?</UTT>No way!  How does that even work?</UTT>according to the article, the author's father would roll up newspaper in a cone and light it thinking it would heal the earache</UTT>Wow!  I am thankful my parents didn't follow traditions to cure earaches.  I wonder if he has an exhibition in Baltimore at the Parenting: An art without a Manual.  Sounds like that father should have his own display!</UTT>haha seriously! what do you think are some of the things on display there?</UTT>Remember the Simpson's?  Homer and Marge?  I can picture lots of displays with some of their antics through the years.  I am sure it's full of well intentioned unconditional loving parents who made innocent mistakes or had crazy fears.</UTT>yes i'm seeing now the the exhibit is both heartbreaking and hilarious, it must span all sorts of parenting debacles</UTT>Absolutely!  Typically, anyone can be a parent.  Even Charles Manson had a son.  I can't imagine growing up under his shadow.</UTT>whoa i didnt know he had a child! did the child even know him?</UTT>I don't know, but there is an exhibition that uses art to portray families like his and other dysfunctional families.  I have heard it is an emotional exhibition.</UTT>yes it sounds like it. especially that exhibit portraying his mother who committed suicide and abusive father</UTT>Very sad indeed!  I liked the piano analogy that expresses that children are like piano's that just because you have one doesn't mean you can play (or parent).  It reminds me of the hindenburg tragedy.  They brought aboard a 356lb grand piano on the flight.</UTT>what happened in the tragedy?</UTT>The Hindenburg crashed and caught fire.  Some climbers found a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain in 2006.  I know the Hindenburg piano caught fire, but it makes you wonder how a piano made it to the top of a mountain.</UTT>it sure does, and do you think the piano caused the plane to crash or it was just an odd coincidence that it was aboard?</UTT>The piano didn't cause the crash or else it would be famous like the piano used to record 2 famous songs the Bohemian Rhapsody and Hey Jude.  Those songs are amazing.  I wonder what songs the BBC broadcasted in 1930 instead of news reporting.</UTT>i know do you think it was classical music? It must have been something to appeal to the masses</UTT>I am not sure, but the news must have been really dull to end up playing piano music.  Too bad we don't do that today.  We should also be allowed to equip our cars with flame throwers to prevent carjacking like in South-Africa.  Now that is newsworthy!</UTT>haha that would be newsworthy, and dangerous! yikes</UTT>Yes!  Good things our trunks aren't made out of wood anymore or that could be a serious fire situation.</UTT>it was great chatting with you :D
t_6564dcf8-cb1b-412d-be8f-d9fbdfaa8098</CONV>Do you like the NFL?</UTT>I am. I'm a big fan of sports and sports trivia, in general.</UTT>Great, sounds like we will get along, I am a fan of sports as well, do you have a favorite team?</UTT>Definitely not the Saints. They have a pretty sexist policy I'm not a fan of regarding the cheerleaders and players.</UTT>That rule is so unfair, makes me angry, its really humiliating</UTT>Yeah, can you believe they can't even eat in the same restaurant? Not only that, but if a player comes into the restaurant while a cheerleader is already mid-meal, the cheerleader has to leave.</UTT>Terrible rule, I would be so angry and feel so bad if I had to leave, specially if im with friends and family, humiliating and really unfair,</UTT>Oddly enough, though, did you know the league itself has no written rule saying women can't play?</UTT>I don't think that will ever happen, watching a woman play in the NFL</UTT>Apparently, as long as they meet the league's eligibility requirements, they can play.</UTT>I bet woman could be as capable as men in the game if they had the same strength</UTT>Sounds like the increase of females in engineering will be worth it over a career in football, anyhow, as the average lifetime earnings of an engineer is higher than that of a football player.</UTT>Oh I see, and I do agree sexism can be another issue, amazing how much money engineers make</UTT>It's pretty crazy how much football players make though, considering the average game only has an average of 11 minutes of actual gameplay.</UTT>Only 11 minutes? what a scam, the game lasts 60 minutes and only 11 minutes accounts to less than a quarter,</UTT>A televised game lasts even longer than an hour, in my experience. I suppose we could use the tracking chips in the players' pads and the balls to find out how they really spend most of their time.</UTT>That is a great idea, that way we can tell the distance they actually run, the calories and many different stats about the game, cool facts and stats</UTT>More specifically, they use the tracking devices to track velocity, rotation, ball speed, and location.</UTT>Do you like basketball as well?</UTT>I like it less than football, but I think it's funny that the US Supreme Court building has a basketball court on top of the building called "the highest court in the land".</UTT>That is a great name for a court, must be really nice to play or watch a game there, judges must play tournamets all the time
t_7fa6a703-e724-4b14-8f68-8e4aef0888d0</CONV>How's it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley</UTT>I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan!</UTT>It's kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie</UTT>Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later</UTT>I'm surprised the boy from the shinning couldn't figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins</UTT>right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office</UTT>Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie</UTT>Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don't do anything else lol</UTT>Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too</UTT>I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?</UTT>I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie</UTT>I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget!</UTT>Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop</UTT>sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol</UTT>Well it couldn't of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office</UTT>for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing</UTT>That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he's grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office</UTT>Man, he should be in every movie at that much money! Youre guaranteed to make money at that rate i think</UTT>Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw</UTT>That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!</UTT>Have a good one
t_b9e28141-7cc5-4303-98b4-51bbc53a9380</CONV>Hello there, do you enjoy comedy movies or tv shows?</UTT>I do enjoy them both. What about you? I love Comedy Central but hate that they have cancelled over 100 shows since the network began in 1989.</UTT>I really love comedy both in movies and tv.  That is a crazy amount of shows to be cancelled!</UTT>Agreed. Can you also believe the Green Lantern movie was initially going to be a comedy with Jack Black? I would have like to have seen that!</UTT>That is pretty funny, yeah I would have seen that!</UTT>Did you ever watch 3rd Rock From the Sun? I was so happy when it won the best comedy series Golden Globe back in 97. It had some stiff competition but still won the award and they deserved it!</UTT>Yeah I used to watch that shows years ago when it was still airing.  I think there are a lot of friends fans who were upset, I don't care for friends myself.</UTT>Neither do I, honestly! What about Kung Fu Hustle? I kind of agree with Bill Murray when he basically said it's the supreme achievement of modern age comedy.</UTT>I think I read about that back when he said it, I think he was being super sarcastic.</UTT>Maybe so! Are you also a fan of British comedy group Monty Python? The Python Programming Language creator basically named it that to honor the group! I thought that was cool.</UTT>I used to love watching those movies as a kid.  I think that is a really cool tribute too!</UTT>So true! So speaking of comedy, did you like Incredibles 2? I enjoyed it even though the present day events were set way back in the 1960s!</UTT>Yeah I thought it was pretty good, and I thought that was cool it was set back then.</UTT>I think it's funny the Director Brad Bird only used artists who were likely to be fired or quit Pixar because he believed they were capable of creating what he needed. That was smart of him!</UTT>That is pretty wild, and I guess he also did one of the voices in the movie, probably saved some bucks.</UTT>Yeah, he probably did. Did you know a sequel came out in the form of a video game 13 years before Incredibles 2 that's called Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer?</UTT>No I never knew that, that is kind of crazy though, there are probably some conspiracy theorists out there talking lol.</UTT>You maybe right about that. Ha! Speaking of video games, did you ever play the Nintendo Entertainment System? It's hard to believe it could only display 54 colors!</UTT>I used to love playing that as a kid, we played whole seasons of Tecmo Super Bowl with all my friends. How about you?</UTT>I loved it as well! In fact, I can't believe it wasn't discontinued until 2003 in Japan. I figured it was long before that!</UTT>Yeah that is one hell of a run for a video game system!  Nice talking with you today, have a good one!
t_efd95c16-ceca-429d-82e3-59963c2a2872</CONV>Do you use Facebook?</UTT>All the time, both as a business and a personal account.</UTT>nice, I have a personal account. Can you imagine if myspace would have bought facebook back in the day at 75 million dollars</UTT>They would definitely be a lot more relevant today.  I havent been on my space since 2006 anyway...</UTT>me too lol. I think myspace would have ruined this. Now facebook is worth like 104 billion dollars</UTT>It must be nice to be Mark Zuckerburg.</UTT>For sure, he has been in the press too much lately, I couldn't do that</UTT>He is actually color-blind that is why facebook is blue.</UTT>Wow didn't know that, I always thought blue was too much lol. Did you ever participate in the burger king promotion?</UTT>No!  I could have eaten well for free though.  I could get rid of some people on my friends list for a whopper.</UTT>For sure, I have a ton of friends i could unadd lol</UTT>It sure has a lot of use.  Iceland is even using it for input on constitution rewrites.</UTT>That is hilarious. I wonder if they get some crazy ideas! At least they allow the like button, some german state made it illegal</UTT>I have heard that before.  I wonder how that works, if there is some sort of geofence that disables it for all people when they are in that region.</UTT>I was just thinking the same thing. Sounds more illegal than anything lol</UTT>It really kind of does, like censorship.</UTT>for sure, oh well, at least it isn't here lol. do you like fish</UTT>I like to loo at them, eat them not so much.  However Id like to be like that immortal jellyfish.  Thatd be cool</UTT>There is no way that thing couldn't die lol, there has to be a way! It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>It has been a great chat!  Have a great day!</UTT>you too, and a great weekend!
t_6a332fdd-48e5-4a91-8769-db1f4ab46e79</CONV>I find space to be fascinating. How about you?</UTT>I do too! Can you believe the sunset on mars is blue?</UTT>I had no idea. I bet that is beautiful. Did you know that sound on Mars may have a higher pitch than on Earth?</UTT>I believe it! Mars is so cool, I'm glad we are getting more research done up there!</UTT>I agree. If you were able to fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration it would only take 2 or 3 days. Maybe we will be able to accomplish that someday.</UTT>I'm sure we will! I think it is cool that curiosity robot sings happy birthday to itself on mars!</UTT>Oh wow! That's adorable. Apparently Lichens and Cybanobacteria would be able to live on Mars. Do you think we will find microscopic life on Mars?</UTT>I hope we do! Do you know why we call it mars?</UTT>I do not. Why do we call it Mars?</UTT>It's named after the roman god of war! Interesting huh?</UTT>Very interesting. I should have guessed that since so many celestial bodies are named after gods. Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars?</UTT>I didn't hear about that, what happened?</UTT>It was because Locheed Martin used the imperial system but Nasa used metric. Whoops.</UTT>Maybe they should have planned that a little better! I think it's epic that the sun makes up 99.86 percent of the mass of our solar system!</UTT>I did not know that either. That's mind boggling.</UTT>I agree! There's even a radio station that translate solar activity into sound for you!</UTT>That would be interesting to listen to. Did you know that the sun is actually white?</UTT>I didn't know that, I wonder why we see it as yellow!</UTT>It is because of atmospheric scattering.</UTT>That is so interesting! Earth and everything is so exciting! Well I had a great chat with you!</UTT>Nice chatting with you as well. Have a lovely evening.
t_94e6af90-51bf-42f8-b7ec-d07f738c66bc</CONV>Hi, do you watch Brooklyn nine nine?</UTT>Hi, I don't but I heard it was cancelled? Are you a big fan?</UTT>I am a big fan. It was canceled by Fox but picked up by NBC. It has such good writing on it. Do you watch a lot of tv?</UTT>Oh that's good. Fox loss. They seem to cancel a lot of shows people really like. I do watch a lot of TV.</UTT>I watch a little tv but I always have live sports on in the back ground. Not sure why.</UTT>I'm just glad fox hasn't cancelled The Simpsons. After all these years I still find it funny.</UTT>Me too. Although they had some infighting at one point. Fox News wanted to sue the simpsons.</UTT>Yes. Simpsons often make fun of Fox. When you think about it, the show doesn't really fit their other programming but they know it makes them so much money. It will be weird when it finally does come to an end. Homer has had so many different jobs through the years..</UTT>How many jobs has he had?</UTT>Well over 200 now. Over the first 400 episodes he had 188 and there are a lot more new episodes with new jobs.</UTT>Wow. My wife would kill me if I changed jobs that often. And Mr. Burns must be a good guy to always take him back at the plant.</UTT>haha, true. Mr. Burns is not as evil as some would have you believe. The only reason I still look forward to Halloween is new Treehouse of horror episodes.</UTT>Those are good. It's the only time we really get to see the aliens.</UTT>Kang and Kodos! So I went to buy a new TV at best buy a few weeks ago, and they had to go into the warehouse to get one for me. The guy took forever to come back. Turns out he found an old black and white tv while he was looking for my led tv.</UTT>Really? That's nuts. How big was it?</UTT>Just little, maybe 15" which is probably how it went unnoticed for so long. It's amazing how much tv technology has changed. The led is way better then the plasma I replaced.</UTT>Yeah. I remember we had a small TV we took on camping trips and it never worked.</UTT>Even the simpsons cartoon tv has been replaced with a more modern 16x9 tv compared to the old one they had. It's interesting 3d tv never took off..</UTT>My friend had one and it was so uncomfortable watching it with glasses on. I think if they did sports in 3d, that would have been better.</UTT>Maybe, but if you're going to go that far you might as well just go watch the event live. I agree they are too uncomfortable.</UTT>It was great chatting with you! Have a great day!
t_88c13032-2076-49bf-9d71-24930705794f</CONV>Hi, did you ever play with a Nintendo?</UTT>I did love my Nintendo - I have not played on it in years tho.</UTT>Did you know it only had 54 colors?</UTT>I did actually.  I seem to remember that it stopped being made around 2003?</UTT>Yes, it was a great console and so much fun to play with</UTT>Are you a football fan?  This season was great ending with the Super Bowl</UTT>I sure am . Did you know women can play too in the NFL?</UTT>Yes I had heard that but it has never happened.  I would like to work for Matt Patricia - he is an actual rocket scientist</UTT>Wow that is pretty cool, what a career change that must have been</UTT>Yes - his school RPI  had the best fight song - it included sin cosine and tangent as well as 6 digits of pi</UTT>Haha that is so awesome. There are only 11 minutes of live gameplay  in a game</UTT>Yes that is not very much - that must be why engineers make more than NFL players</UTT>Yup that makes sense. They also have longer careers so maybe that helps a bit there too</UTT>Yes - did you know the first NFL playoff game was in 1932 on an 80 yard long dirt field?</UTT>Cool, did not know that. Did you hear of that rule that New Orleans cheerleaders have to abide to?</UTT>That they have to leave the restaurant if a player walks in?  That is awful!</UTT>That sure is and I really think it is outdated and needs to go</UTT>Definitely - even though it is allowed I cannot see the Saints allowing a female player</UTT>I guess. DO you like Brady?</UTT>Tom Brady is an amazing quarterback who has won 6 super bowls.</UTT>He sure is and there is no stopping the guy. Nice chat
t_b34c1f71-91c7-4c57-8aa6-462c2b908b54</CONV>What forms of entertainment do you enjoy?</UTT>I breed chickens. Just kidding. I enjoy movies, radio, and music. A good movie soundtrack really hits the spot!  What about you?</UTT>Lol nice intro</UTT>Thanks. Maybe I could get a job with Steven Spielberg... He can play the clarinet like he did for the soundtrack of Jaws, and I can pretend to be talented.  What do you think?</UTT>I always like it when the director or producer directly plays a part like stan lee</UTT>Yeah, or M. Night Shamalan (spelling?). I alsolike it when celebrities mock themselves, like Kanye West did on SNL. Although Taylor Swift may not have enjoyed that...</UTT>True. I agree</UTT>You gotta have a sense of humor about these things!  Like when Taylor Swift acceidnetally release 8 seconds of white noise, which ended up topping the charts in Canada! Tat is a great commentary on what Canadians enjoy about Swift music...</UTT>I guess it is all about the brand</UTT>Maybe. Do you think her proclivity to walk backwards to avoid having her photo taken is brand-building?</UTT>No. I genuinely think paparazzi are jerks</UTT>Agreed.  Still, it would be nice to have her $40 mil jet and personal airport hanger in Nashville. Right?</UTT>True True</UTT>Let change the subject to something more profound and significant... Haave you ever read "Starship Troopers"...after all, it is on the reading list of 3 of the 5 military branches, so it's gotta be good, right??</UTT>I have read it as well as Ender's game. Both great books</UTT>Did you experience a "Moral Panic" from those novels like so many did in the 18th century upon reading novels?</UTT>Lol of course not</UTT>I would love to attend one of those "You laugh, you lose" contests made famous by CS Lewis and Tolkien. I could end up being the biggest loser!</UTT>Indeed. It would be really fun to watch. Kind of like harmon's quest</UTT>Oh, and it would be really lovely if they speed-read their horrible poetry out loud! I don't know if they could achieve the record 4700 words per minute laike Anne Jones, but it would be fun watching them try!</UTT>Indeed. Anyway thanks for chatting.
t_bc408a1e-918a-4909-9f8b-2704b5659769</CONV>Good morning! How are you today?</UTT>hi how are you? I'm good</UTT>I'm doing well! Are you a fan of football at all?</UTT>I sometimes watch. i try to watch the super bowl.</UTT>This year it was so boring! It was even more boring to know that only 11 minutes of live gameplay happened in it haha.</UTT>I think the game was better the previous year. a big comeback at the end. 11 minutes? yeah, it seems too short. but there is so much violence, people love it.</UTT>Oh I agree! I bet it was a better game than in 1916 where Cumberland lost to Georgia Tech 222-0 lol.</UTT>I wonder what the coach was thinking there. I think that a game like that is shameful. what is the point?</UTT>I feel like the team just gave up from the beginning. Maybe they had a pink locker room like the Iowa Hawkeye's visitor locker room is.</UTT>that pink locker room stunt! does that work at all? does u of Iowa win a lot at home? i doubt it.</UTT>I don't think it works. I'm a Hawkeye fan and they seem to win more on the road haha.</UTT>if it worked, other teams would do the same thing. still, it is a fun fact.</UTT>Well said! Can you believe the Green Bay Packers have been around since 1919?</UTT>Yes, i can. that is a strange name though. what exactly do they pack?</UTT>I'm not sure! I know they were started based off the name of Indian Packing Company!</UTT>Oh, that makes sense. were they a meat packing company? did they own the team? i think the team is owned by the city now.</UTT>I know they paid for the Packers first uniforms if they named the team after them. Good move on their part since they've sold out every game since 1960!</UTT>yeah, i wonder how much it would cost to buy tix from someone. the secondary market must be expensive.</UTT>I agree! I wish I would have been at the game where they first lost to the Beloit Fairies. That is a unique name for a football team!</UTT>What a name. How would you like play for that team? "Hello, im a fairy. No seriously, I am!" Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Haha too funny! Have a great day!
t_9281a020-d641-4535-bd1f-e783685b228f</CONV>Do you like horror films?</UTT>Not really. Do you like them?  I've heard that watching them can burn calories.</UTT>I dont really like them either but if I can burn 180 calories then I might give then a try lol</UTT>i hear that lol!  It's weird but watching a horror movie can make you like abstract art more for some reason.</UTT>I see, thats interesting, a movie I did like was the Shining, have you seen that one?</UTT>I saw that one a long time ago.  .  I guess Bram Stoker is the catalyst for my favorite horror movie if you can call it that. I have a deep fear of Salem's Lot.</UTT>I do too, well in the shining the boy, Danny, didnt even know he was in a horror film he was tricked lol</UTT>I guess they did that so as not to scare him maybe.  Have you read any Edgar Allan Poe.  HIs works are said to have inspired some horror movies today.</UTT>I have, he has great poems, I think that his contributions are important, authors like him, Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley have sure transformed things.</UTT>They really have.  I wonder what made them write what they did.  It was all so long ago. I mean, horror has been around now for over a hundred years.</UTT>I guess their stories were so dark that the horror genre was born, maybe they didnt have that in mind, to have such influence on literature.</UTT>Maybe not.  Literature has had an effect on television too.  Sometimes you can't tell though. I mean, pokemon has over 750 episodes but i really have no idea what old literature could have inspired that!</UTT>Well I love Pokemon, its been one of my favorite shows for over 16 years now although the original pokemons were my favorite</UTT>I like it too I just mean I don't see where it could have gotten it's inspiration.  Maybe it just comes from studying animals in general.  Perhaps the creators of Pokemon were into zoology.</UTT>Thats an interesting question, I think they were, afterall there are 20 quintillion animals on the planet so there plenty of places to look for inspiration.</UTT>That's definitely true.  You could even look back into early life when some animals had gills and lungs.</UTT>I think thats why we have hiccups, they are some kind of holdover from previous years</UTT>You're probably right about that.  Thinking about old dinosaurs and such makes me think of the Loch Ness Monster. Did you know it is a protected species in Scotland?</UTT>I did not know that, I guess its a good thing in case a hunter decides to get it as a trophy, it would be amazing to see the Lochness Monster live.</UTT>It truly would.  I like to think that it is real and somewhere in the deep, unexplored depths of the ocean.  I mean, over 1.5 million animals are known and it's estimated there are over 7 million so it's possible.</UTT>I think we just have to look harder and we might find it, I hope to be alive by then.
t_80126bbc-ecfc-4eba-a7d9-71c724bbe560</CONV>Hello! Are you interested in Presidents?</UTT>I love leaders of republics. How about you?</UTT>I find president history fascinating. Do you know the tip three wealthiest presidents?</UTT>JFK was one of them. I am less sure about the others.</UTT>It was jfk, washington, and jefferson.</UTT>But Washington had wooden teeth didn't he? YOu think he could afford ivory... Does the President of Zimbabwe, Pres Banana,  has his original teeth?</UTT>I am not sure. But i wonder why they call him Banana?</UTT>Maybe he has gone soft on crime?  Or, maybe it is his stage name, in preparation for release of his new cd? He has to catch up on released albums to the standard set by Pres of Indonesia</UTT>I think it is funny that he has released 3 pop albums.</UTT>That is funny. Another funny fact: The runner up in Pres elections used to automatically earn the spot of VP. Can you imagine the insaity it would create if that rule wa still in place?</UTT>That was probably crazy with opposing views.</UTT>The Gov is a crazy entity.   Did you know that 86% of Nevada is owned by the feds?</UTT>That is crazy! I wonder what they do with all of that property?</UTT>They need some of it to store the Eiffel Tower they just bought froom some impersonator of the French Gov...</UTT>I heard that he sold the tower twice!</UTT>Incredible!  At least the Norwegian Gov didn;t bite. They had their money tied up in a $1 Bil pledge to help save the Amazon rain forest.</UTT>I wish more people could pledge that much money</UTT>I wonder what the French dude accepted as payment for the tower?  Well, all this show of confidence is why states like Nevada are putting a slot for "None of these candidates" on the ballot for Pres...</UTT>I am not sure. I would need to do more research.</UTT>While you are researching, find out who the tallest presidential candidate is this go round... Since 1900, the taller candidate has wone over 70% of the time...</UTT>I will look into it! Have a nice day.
t_b0e43eb6-9282-40e9-b4ba-13b6990a4872</CONV>Good evening!  Do you have a chance to travel much?</UTT>Hi,</UTT>I don't travel a lot.  I am certainly no King Kalakaua of Hawaii who actually traveled around the world and was the first king to do so.</UTT>I hit enter too soon! Sorry. Yes, I have been fortunate to visit Italy in 2018 and Iceland in 2017. This year we are going to Africa. I was surprised that tourism in the US is down! Do you think it is the political environment?</UTT>It could be.  When you were in Iceland did you take flights to go from city to city since there isn't really a rail provider?</UTT>No, we rented a car because we had two weeks and getting all the way around is doable with a car. Driving was good and we went in October so didn't have to contend with snow. Where have you traveled?</UTT>I have been to Hawaii and Germany, but it is usually just in the continental US.  I wouldn't mind going to Japan, but i hear the tolls are very expensive!</UTT>Yes, $300 to travel across the country! In Italy, we took a toll road and had to hunt for the 28 euro when we finally exited the road. We were in the Amalfi Coast in October and I was really surprised how crowded it was. I can understand what the article is saying about overcrowding.</UTT>While tourism is usually a good thing, countries really have to plan and prepare for it.  If they don't plan appropriately, they will definitely have trouble dealing with an influx of travelers.</UTT>We are seeing that in California. Places like Big Sur have had so many tourists taking selfies at iconic places and then leaving trash or doing something dangerous just to get that perfect picture.</UTT>Maybe it is time to go to a simpler place like Mackinac island where they still use horse-drawn carriages and cars are banned.</UTT>People will eventually find all the great spots. The article mentions Emilia-Romagna or Extremadura. I have never heard of either of those places.</UTT>Well maybe you will go there sometime soon.  I think I'd take that over a trip to any of the Walt Disney themed parks though.</UTT>Not a Disneyland fan? Have you ever been? I went about 2 years ago with daughter's family. It was a zoo. And it was March which can't be the most popular time.</UTT>I think I just have issues with Disney in general.  I can't deny their success though.  I find it interesting that they would choose a celebrity like Bill Nye to work on the Flubber movie.</UTT>How about their business model of reinventing something? Beauty and the Beast as an animated film, then a Broadway musical, then a live action movie.</UTT>I find making hits out of already hits to be lazy.  I guess they do have some original content like Big Hero 6 where they used a big supercomputer to render the whole thing.</UTT>Right - but not sure how successful Big Hero 6 was. Interesting facts about the telephone. It sounds like fake news that Unicef will donate a day of clean water to a child in need for every minute you do not use your cell phone. How would they know?</UTT>Why not just give them the clean water anyway?  if we can male an iPhone with more computing capabilities than our US Nuclear ICBM armament, you think they could figure out better ways to  give kids clean water.</UTT>Good point. Well, I'm looking forward to hearing more about a bus that will travel at 160 mph. Not sure I want to ride on it though.</UTT>As long as it is safe and efficient, but I doubt I will be seeing anything like that near me anytime soon.</UTT>nice chatting with  you!</UTT>Same with you.
t_0ed6e49d-975c-4d9a-ae57-2ac92ec3f144</CONV>Merry Christmas!  I am just about to watch something on Netflix.</UTT>Merry Christmas ! What are you watching ?</UTT>I was thinking of watching Stranger Things. Have you watched that series yet?</UTT>Yes I did. They did a great job showing the 80s :) music, clothing, etc.</UTT>I am looking forward to it.  Netflix has really come a long way in just a few years.</UTT>absolutely, from like 2 movies in 2016 they went to dozens in 2018. They're doing a great job !</UTT>I agree.  They haven't completely eclipsed HBO, but they definitely put themselves in front of nominations.</UTT>...but didn't GoT got the most awards ? I don't remember...</UTT>I know it is the banner program for HBO.  I bet GoT is expensive to make, but it is still doing really well.</UTT>yes, but sometimes the fact that Netflix has SO many tvshows, it doesn't mean that the quality is high as well...</UTT>I guess if you put a lot out, something is bound to be good.  Can you believe that between 9pm and 12am, Netflix accounts for one third of all North American bandwidth?</UTT>sorry I didn't understand that ? Netflix accounts for one third of all North American what ?</UTT>Bandwidth is how they measure things like internet/wifi usage.  So what it really means is a lot of people are watching Netflix each night.</UTT>I wonder how they measure that ?</UTT>I believe whatever network you are using measures it.  Regardless, it's crazy to think that Netflix was started by someone who racked up late fees on a movie rental.</UTT>movie rentals ? Is that who founded Netflix?</UTT>His name is Reed Hastings.</UTT>Now he probably sits on a beach ans drinking whiskey :) he doesn't have to work anymore :)</UTT>I know!  His company is worth $2 billion, and another company decline a chance to buy it for $50 million.</UTT>do You know what company is that ?</UTT>That was Blockbuster which used to be a movie rental place, but I believe is now bankrupt.</UTT>...and they wanted to buy out Netflix ?</UTT>I don't know who initiated, but I know they thought $50 million must have been too much.  Have a Merry Christmas.

Did you know that he popularized many words and phrases?</UTT>Yes like, good riddance in my heart of hearts and many more</UTT>Yes. He lived at the same time as Pocahontas too</UTT>I wonder what it might have been like had they met somehow</UTT>Yeah. Did you know Tchaikovsky was obsessed with Shakespeare?</UTT>Yes he donated his skull to be used in his plays eventually</UTT>Yes and it was used for the skull of yorick in hamlet</UTT>Yea. Did you know he also invented some names?</UTT>Yes names like Jessica, Olivia and Miranda</UTT>Yeah. And some of his plays have to be played in old english as they change meaning otherwise</UTT>Yes otherwise puns do not work in modern day language</UTT>Yeah. Do you like dramas?</UTT>Yes I do. Have you ever seen House MD?</UTT>Yes , Laurie made $700 000 per episode in that show</UTT>Yeah that is a lot. Do you like Jim Carrey?</UTT>Yes he is so funny. Did you know he does not do dramas anymore?</UTT>Yes as they do not project positivity</UTT>Yeah, I guess that makes sense quite a bit</UTT>Yeah. It was nice chatting with you</UTT>Same here
t_a69f06fc-3c99-46e7-98a0-7de305152476</CONV>Do you like dogs?</UTT>Me? Sure! I love dogs! By the way, how are you?</UTT>Good, thanks! Dogs are so smart. They are the only animals besides elephants that can naturally understand pointing.</UTT>I think dogs understand quite a few words too. smarter than chimps in many ways.</UTT>And they arent color blind as I was once taught!</UTT>I thought they were colorblind too. I guess that they see some colors, which makes sense. they have great ears and noses too.</UTT>Apparently they can see as many colors as we can. Do you think that's true?</UTT>that sounds funny. it think the visual cortex of humans is far more developed. maybe we have been resolution? i dont know.</UTT>Ah, that could be right! In Istanbul you can get food for strays by recycling bottles at a vending machine. Pretty interesting.</UTT>I think that was a clever idea. it was good to get the dogs involved in keeping the city clean. plus they get fed!</UTT>Haha, true! Dogs can also donate blood at blood drives. Not sure how I feel about that though, doesn't seem they can really consent.</UTT>True, but the dogs probably would like to help if they could. usually dogs are pack animals. they look out for each other.</UTT>That might be why we love them so much. Google even prefers dogs to cats and says so on their code of conduct.</UTT>I think that dogs are pretty good for the office. People pet dogs and their mood improves. I would love to work in an office with a dog.</UTT>Do you commute to work?</UTT>Sometimes. I do a lot of telecommuting.</UTT>I guess we have the 1908 Model T to thank for being able to commute easily. But Karl Benz was the one who invented what's considered the modern car.</UTT>Every car maker owes a debt to benz. Ford made the car available to the common man.</UTT>Cars were adopted really fast in the US though they took a while to get accepted in other parts of the world. Glad we don't have to travel by horse and carriage anymore.</UTT>Yes, there were tremendous problems with manure in cities. It was a pretty smelly problem. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Nice chat! Time for me to take a drive, I guess!

Did you ever use Myspace?</UTT>Yes, they had a chance to buy Facebook for $75 millions and did not</UTT>Yesh too bad they could have made billions by now</UTT>Yeah true. Do you know the like button is illegal in parts of Germany?</UTT>Yes I wonder what happened there for it to be illegal</UTT>Yeah. DO you know why it is blue?</UTT>Yes because Mark is colorblind for green and red</UTT>Yeah. In Iceland they are using it to rewrite the constitution</UTT>Yes I wonder how that is working, it is pretty public</UTT>Yeah I know. Do you watch much tv?</UTT>I do . Do you watch the Simpsons at all?</UTT>Yes I do. There is an episode where Bart does not appear at all</UTT>Yea and he is not even mentioned in it</UTT>Yeah. Did you ever watch That 70s Show?</UTT>Yes it was good but it did not do well in the UK though</UTT>Yes it failed after just 10 episodes because they remade it verbatim</UTT>Yeah. Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank?</UTT>Yes, did you know Alec Baldwin did the voice for 52 epsidoes?</UTT>Yes and so did Ringo Starr and George Carlin too. What a cast of actors.</UTT>I know star studded cast for sure. Nice chatting today with you.

Do you like to use Amazon?</UTT>I like to use amazon sometimes. it can be quite convenient. You?</UTT>It really is. I do too, been getting just about everything from there now haha. Even on Sundays!</UTT>I am amazed that the USPS delivers on sundays. i thought those guys would never work on sundays. they must get triple overtime.</UTT>My day was a postman but he never had to go out on Sundays. It is usually the part time people that got paid 16 bucks an hour to go do it. Kind of sad if you ask me.</UTT>Ok, so it is not expensive for the post office to deliver. i guess part timers need the work. It is probably better than the amazon warehouse.</UTT>Yes I agree, unless you want to walk 7 to 15 miles each day working haha.</UTT>i guess it keeps you in shape, or it kills you. one or the other. i dont think the pay is good either.</UTT>I heard it's terrible to work there! I wish I was the first person to make a purchase from Amazon back in the day!</UTT>You could have a building named after you! I would rather have amazon prime for life.</UTT>But you can at least brag about the building since everybody has Prime haha.</UTT>Yes, that is true. I wonder if people know his name. maybe he got stuck with a warehouse job too LOL</UTT>They probably told him it would be the best job in the world, jokes on him though haha. I like using Google a lot as well.</UTT>I use google a lot. google is a dog company. i approve.</UTT>I approve with two thumbs up! They also like goats too and let them be their landscapers haha.</UTT>do the goats get stock options? if so, sign me up!</UTT>They are probably more well of than we are lol. Well it was nice chatting with you!</UTT>yes, i enjoyed chatting with you. Have a good day!</UTT>Thanks you as well!
t_2df7d9e2-0eb3-4eeb-bb3c-42eb60bb13e5</CONV>Have you ever seen Keeping up with the Kardashians?</UTT>Yes, I know bits and pieces. I know Kim was born 10-21-80.</UTT>Yeah, it's basically just her and her family doing everyday life things. Did you know she named her baby Chicago?</UTT>I did know. It is a nod to Kanye's hometown and the city is special to K & K  so the name is perfect because baby Chicago was hard to conceive so she is extra special as well.</UTT>That's a pretty sweet meaning. Did you know Kim used to be Paris Hilton's personal assistant?</UTT>I did know. That is how she first gained media attention but after her 2003 sex tape was leaked in 2007 she really became popular.</UTT>That</UTT>I know one of my kids used to play the Kim Kardashian app on their phone. I think it came out in 2014.</UTT>Sorry about that, I accidentally pressed enter. I haven't used the app, but I have heard of it. She was also in a fall out boy music video. I wonder which song?</UTT>I did not know she was in a music video. I know after the 2007 sex tape leak she and her family began appearing on E! reality TV show Keeping up With the Kardashians.</UTT>Yeah, that's a really lucky break for releasing a sex tape. I'm pretty sure her mom released it on purpose.</UTT>Maybe. I know Kim is on the 2015 Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential people.</UTT>She definitely has a lot of influence. She recently met with trump to discuss prison reform.</UTT>I did not know that, but good for her. I know she also has a book about how she is a trailblazer of the selfie movement.</UTT>Yeah, she's definitely a busy and hardworking person. Speaking of celebrities, did you know Judge Judy makes $123,000 an episode?</UTT>Holy cow! That is a lot of money! I wonder where she rates on Hollywood's likability "q score"? I know Tom Hanks rates a 48, while Kim's is a -71, which is hilarious.</UTT>I've never heard of a q-score, but it sounds really interesting. I think most of the Kardashians are probably not good in relations to likability.</UTT>I would have to agree. I know critics and admirers have described her as exemplifying the notion of being famous for being famous.</UTT>Yeah, she doesn't have a lot of actual talents. Just being wealthy and now famous. They are always coming up with new ways to stay in the spotlight.</UTT>Yes, I agree. Although she is reported to be the highest-paid reality personality of 2015 with her total earnings exceeding $53 million.</UTT>Yeah, I guess I would do some silly stuff like that if I was making that much money off of it. It was nice chatting with you!
t_1c1c37fc-9015-4e48-8167-3af0c14b747b</CONV>Hey, how are you doing today?</UTT>I'm great.  How about yourself?</UTT>I'm doing pretty good, just trying to get rid of some hiccups. Did you know that hiccups are a holdover from early evolution when early land animals had both gills and lungs?</UTT>No, I didn't know that.  How interesting.</UTT>I know! The correlation between our anatomy and animals is pretty neat. Did you know that the study of animals is called Zoology?</UTT>Yeah, I remember taking Zoology in school.  Did you know that there are over 7 million animal species?</UTT>That's pretty wild. I have recently learned that there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on earth, that is astonishing!</UTT>That is amazing!  I was shocked to learn recently that there are some animals that can theoretically live forever, because they are biologically immortal.</UTT>Oh wow, that's really interesting. Did you know that in 2002 Germany became in the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights?</UTT>You know I had heard that and I also read somewhere that there is a lawyer in Switzerland who represents animals in court.  How wild is that?</UTT>That is pretty wild, I heard that under the provisions of the 1912 Scottish Protection of Animals Act that the Loch Ness Monster is a protected species!</UTT>Now that is wild.  Animals are so interesting to me.  I learned in college that they are like humans, they have a dominant "paw" or side.</UTT>They are definitely interesting. Did you know that they develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?</UTT>How cool, strange but cool, nonetheless.  I also learned that animals from geographically distant area often speak different"languages" or "dialects", just like people.</UTT>That's interesting. I wonder if my dog speaks with a southern dialect?</UTT>Mine most definitely does! I'm so glad that the world is appreciating and respecting the animals more.  I read somewher that the Netherlands is constructing special bridges for wildlife.</UTT>I wish they would do that here. It breaks my heart seeing dead animals on the side of the road.</UTT>Me too.  The bridges connect habitats and keep the animals from being hit by cars.  Such a good thing that they do need to be constructed here.</UTT>That would help so much here, I don't see why they don't do it.</UTT>Agreed.  On a different note, I'm 50 years old and I just found out what the E. in Chuck E. Cheese stands for!</UTT>I have no idea what it stands for. I always thought it was Eugene or something like that.</UTT>Nope, you're wrong.  It's entertainment.  Charles Entertainment Cheese!  Well, it's been nice chatting with you, friend.  I've got to get to work.  Talk to you later!

Moonves just got fired for cause and lost millions!</UTT>Sexual misconduct is a very serious charge and this must really affect the entertainment industry considering his role.</UTT>Yeah. I just am so sad for all the victims. It puts them in such a bad spot.</UTT>Having lots of power it must be hard for the victims to stand up to someone in such a position.  Harvey Weinstein stories of women set the bar high</UTT>Yeah... on . lighter note, When south park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew</UTT>That's a sweet gesture.  There are actually 750 episodes of Pokemon.  Have you seen any?</UTT>I have in passing... i have a 7 year old. How about you? Pokemon fan?</UTT>kids used to like it but outgrown I guess.  There is only one episode of the Simpsons without Bart</UTT>I did not know that... 70's show was remade verbatim in the uk. 'days like these' was cancelled after 10 episodes.</UTT>No woman was ever nominated for best cinematagrapher academy award.</UTT>Really, that has to be strange not have a women nominated. I feel like they should have been nominated, at least.</UTT>Yes, you would think.  Cinematographer Roger Deakins though has been nominated 13 times without a win for the best cinematographer oscar</UTT>When caesar visited britain, around 50bc, he noted that its people bred chickens not for food, but for entertainment</UTT>I wonder how they entertained? Bill nye seemed to entertain and he got a break in entertainment by winning a steve martin lookalike contest.</UTT>Yeah... Ronald reagan was once rejected for a movie role because an entertainment executive didn't think he had "that presidential look."</UTT>That is funny!  The nintendo entertainment system was discontinued in 2003 in Japan.</UTT>Really? What about the switch. Seems weird.</UTT>Maybe that means the original?  It talks about the entertainment system only displaying 54 colors.</UTT>I did not know that. Only 54?</UTT>Entertainment like storytelling, music, drama, dance and other performances exist in all cultures</UTT>Nice chatting with you.

Do you know when the drive thru was invented?</UTT>Yes that was back in 1975 by McDonald's</UTT>Yes and do you know why they invented it?</UTT>Yes because soldiers were not allowed out of cars in their fatigues</UTT>yeah. Do you know why the trunk of the car is called such?</UTT>Yes because old cars used to have wooden trunks</UTT>Yes. Do you know how cadillac got its name?</UTT>Yes if was after the founder of detroit, de la Mothe Cadillac</UTT>Yeah Do you know who Jonn Mardenborough is?</UTT>Yes he is the guy who became a professional driver by beating people to gran turismo</UTT>Yes he beat a staggering 90 000 people though</UTT>Yeah. In South africa you can put flame throwers n the car to protect it</UTT>Wow cool. Do you like the nba?</UTT>I sure do. Do you know who Kareem Jabbar is?</UTT>Yes he is the guy that used the dunk shot so much it got banned</UTT>Yeah that was crazy and for a good decade at it</UTT>Yeah. Do you know who invented the game?</UTT>Yes James Naismith who was a coach at U of Kansas</UTT>Yes and the only losing coach in their history as well</UTT>Yeah pretty ironic. Nice chatting with you.
t_9196758b-e3c8-4337-81ec-19ee57e38fdc</CONV>What did you do today? I watched television.</UTT>I watched television as well I watched The Simpsons, so funny how homer keeps on switching jobs</UTT>I actually watched the Simpsons as well. Did you know that there is only ONE episode of the Simpsons where Bart isn't mentioned or even appears?</UTT>I didnt know that, I have to watch that episode it must be pretty rare, want a cool fact about The Simpsons?</UTT>Of course I do. You seem to know lots of cool facts about the Simpsons!</UTT>I really love the show that's why, well Homer had about 188 jobs in the first 400 episodes of the series, that means he had a different job every two episodes.</UTT>That's nuts. Do you like Pokemon also?</UTT>Yeah it just to be one of my favorite shows, Charizard and Pikachu are the best, do you like the show?</UTT>Absolutely love it. There are over 750 episodes for me to watch!</UTT>Yeah thats a lot of them, crazy fact about TV deals but most of them show the words 'shark tank' they seem kind of random</UTT>Yeah they do seem kind of random. Another show I really like is Family Guy. I think it's hilarious.</UTT>It is really funny, I like it a lot, seems like you enjoy comedy a lot</UTT>Oh yeah I do. I enjoy watching comedy central a lot.</UTT>I think that's a great channel I watched a movie with Drew Carey the other day, really funny.</UTT>Interesting! Fun fact, Comedy Central has canceled over 100 shows since they've been created.</UTT>That sucks, I bet many fans were upset because of this, kind of remind me of Netflix they have cancelled many of my favorite shows</UTT>Oh yeah for sure. I bet Netflix would be a lot more popular if they also showed some sports.</UTT>Yeah like baseball maybe, are you a baseball fan?</UTT>I am indeed! Baseball is so popular all over the world. It's even popular in Japan.</UTT>It is? I didn't think of Japan as a baseball fan country, did you know that a 17 year old female pitcher was banned from pro baseball after she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig?</UTT>It is! I guess it's SO popular in Japan, that many are surprised to discover that it's also popular in America.</UTT>Yeah well its been nice to chat, one thing to keep in mind next time you watch a game and that is that the opposing team will receive 3 bases if a player catches a ball in their hat
t_35ae8a51-ebd5-47fb-b939-6b3dda601f27</CONV>hello!</UTT>Hello, did you know that the government shut down because of Trump?</UTT>I am very aware, it has been a crazy time with this President.</UTT>I agree. Speaking of presidents, the first president of Zimbabwe was dubbed banana. He must like bananas</UTT>Haha, that is an odd name for a president! It is as funny as the president in Indonesia that made 3 pop albums while he was in office....must have had a lot of time on his hands!</UTT>I know right? The president in Indonesia is like the asian version of Kanye West. Doesn't Kanye West want to run for president?</UTT>I have heard that on television that Kanye wants to run for president ...don't know how well that will work out but crazier things have happened! Almost as funny as how congress has a fantasy congress that they draft members of congress  lol....so much comedy :)</UTT>Wasn't he talking to Trump recently? He wants to make a difference in politics. Drafting members? That makes me think of basketball players getting drafted from one team to the next.</UTT>Yes, Kanye was in the White House visiting the president not too long ago, I watched the video on the television. It was very very crazy...Kanye had to shut down his social media accounts because of backlash.</UTT>I was curious why Kanye did that!!! Now I know why he stopped his social media!</UTT>Yep, it was really not good PR for Kanye. But I am sure it will blow over. Did you see on TV the State of The Union Address tonight by President Trump?</UTT>Oh I think so.</UTT>I was just curious I missed it, but I am sure there will be replays on TV later.</UTT>I do not plan to watch it. I only wait for the news for the results</UTT>Yeah, social media is already talking about it, I probably won't watch Tv tonight anyway lol. I have a couple Tv shows to watch, do you watch TV?</UTT>I do watch TV but not politics. I find it crazy that there are a lot of pokemon episodes beyond my expectation.</UTT>Yes, there have been over 750 episodes for 16 years. I don't know if it is still on tv....</UTT>It is on television. Also, they have it in Netflix as well. I love the first  season of Pokemon. Ash is still 10 years old to this very day.</UTT>Oh really? I didn't know if it was still on anywhere or if it was TV reruns. I watch The Simpson reruns</UTT>They should be on television reruns. Anyways, the Simpson reruns are only online, from my preference.</UTT>Oh, I watch them. It is also fun to watch That 70s Show, love it, one of my fav TV shows! It has been great chatting!</UTT>It was a great conversation!
t_af26f96c-8a56-4212-962d-7108e06d0f60</CONV>Hi are you interested in television shows?</UTT>Hi! I am, actually! How about you? I love The Simpson's and there's actually an episode where Bart never makes an appearance nor is even mentioned that I still want to see. I bet it's weird never seeing Bart at all!</UTT>That would be different.  I've never seen that episode.  When South Park aired its Family Guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the Simpsons crew!</UTT>Wow! That was very nice of them! So we're you a fan of 70s Show? There was a UK remake I wanted to see but it only lasted ten episodes, sadly.</UTT>I was a fan and I've heard of that UK show.  It was called "Days Like These" and I haven't seen it either.</UTT>What gets me is Pokemon has over 750 episodes which is like 50 per year for 16 consecutive years yet the 70s Show remake only lasted ten episodes.</UTT>That's an insane amount of shows.  Did you ever watch Thomas the Tank?  Do you know who the 3 narrators were?  They all did it for at least 52 episodes each.</UTT>I heard it was George Carlin, Alec Baldwin and Ringo Starr, correct? I think that's pretty cool and I'd like to rewatch it just to see if I recognize their voices. Ha!</UTT>Nice!  You got them.  I remember George and Ringo, but not Alec.</UTT>I still think it's cool that they did that! They made a lot of kids' days! But I also enjoy watching shows about the Earth. In fact, I saw recently where the earth will pretty much be free of helium by the end of the century. I'm not sure  if that's a good thing or not.</UTT>I agree!  My kids watched it.  I'm not sure on the helium either.  I do know that people who like to suck it out of balloons and talk high pitched are not going to like it.</UTT>Ha! That is a good point as they certainly won't! But speaking of the earth, it's sad over 80% of our natural forests have been destroyed.</UTT>That is sad indeed.  I'm surprised to always hear about water shortages when 71% of the earths surface is covered with water.</UTT>Tell me about it. It's like, how is that possible? Did you know when the earth was formed that a day was only five and a half hours long? Imagine if that was the case today. We wouldn't accomplish anything!</UTT>lol No we wouldn't.  If Earths history were viewed in a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.</UTT>And in that short time, we've already destroyed so much, sadly. But on a lighter note, did you hear about the UN appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials in the event they ever make contact with us back in 2010? I think that's pretty neat!</UTT>That is neat!  I wonder who it is?  Do you know when the first drive thru was added by McDonalds?</UTT>I heard it was added back in 1957 for soldiers who weren't allowed to exit their cars in fatigues. It's weird because I initially thought drive-thrus were always around. Ha! We've come a long ways since cars became widely available in the early 20th century, right?</UTT>I always thought like that too!  Just kind of always took them for granted.  It's been fun chatting with you!</UTT>What else I think is crazy that's car related is it's actually legal to equip your vehicles with flamethrowers over in South Africa in order to prevent carjacking. I'm glad I don't live there! Ha! Well it's been fun chatting with you as well, friend!</UTT>Me too!  Wouldn't catch me there.  Thanks!
t_a1b301d7-c913-4d54-85b8-74c65688daa9</CONV>Have you heard about the brouhaha in Panama City?</UTT>No I hadn't. It sounds quite crazy though.</UTT>I'm not sure I understand all of the story, but it sounds as if the conflict has international repercussions. Do you play an instrument?</UTT>I do not but I do own a piano.</UTT>The piano has an interesting history. It was invented by an Italian.</UTT>Yes and I think it is so simple yet complex how it makes sound caused from hammers striking the strings.</UTT>I guess before the piano the keyboard instruments plucked the strings. Why would someone put a piano on top of Britain's highest mountain? The eccentricity of the country knows no bounds.</UTT>Or how about a 356 pound grand piano on the lounge of an airship?</UTT>The one made out of aluminum? I wonder if it sounded tinny.</UTT>Probably! Piano music can be quite entertaining. In April 1930 the BBC broadcast piano music instead of reporting the news because it decided there wasn't anything newsworthy.</UTT>That was a pretty bold decision. I wonder whether any news station could get by with reporting a little bit less. They need to fill the time to keep the advertisers.</UTT>That is true. It was probably quite different back then though. Did you know there's a song just for stress testing auto-pianos?</UTT>I guess the song is needed because human beings can't impose enough stress on the machine. I've never heard the tune. I wonder who wrote it.</UTT>Good question. Have you ever tried to play?</UTT>No, I haven't. I don't have a musical bone in my body. I do better at video games.</UTT>I can find the notes and that's about it. Are you a car connoisseur?</UTT>I enjoy driving, but I don't have the money to make it a serious hobby.</UTT>My husband desperately wants to own a Cadillac. They are named after a french explorer.</UTT>Would you take a Cadillac to a McDonald's drive-thru? I guess you would if you were a soldier in uniform!</UTT>Ha, true! Course everyone does it now, soldier or not.</UTT>Great chat!
t_2270ca6a-ad0d-430f-987a-7460520ec242</CONV>Hello there, do you enjoy watching comedy shows or movies?</UTT>Yes, I like comedies. How about you? Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is "the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy". What do you think?</UTT>Yes, comedy is one of my favorite genres to watch for sure.  I think Bill was just being sarcastic, but that's me.</UTT>I cannot say that I agree with Bill on that one. I haven't seen the film myself. What about Jack Black? Do you like him?</UTT>I saw about 5 minutes and that was enough for me.  Yeah I think he is pretty funny, how about you?</UTT>Jack is a natural comedian. The Green Lantern film was originally going to be a comedy starring Jack Black. I would like to have seen that version. I wonder what Bill Murray would have said.</UTT>That would have been very interesting if he did get that part.</UTT>Hard to guess what the execs are thinking when it comes to comedy. Awards shows too. 3rd Rock from the Sun won the Golden Globe for best comedy series in 1997, beating Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.</UTT>Yeah that show was pretty good, but I've always been a Seinfeld fan, how about you?</UTT>Yes, I like Seinfeld quite a bit. Good thing he wasn't on Comedy Central. Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since its creation in 1989.</UTT>That sounds like it was very hard to make the cut for that network wow!</UTT>Why hasn't South Park gotten canceled? LOL. I like that show. I figure they'll be around for a while more.</UTT>Yeah that show was really something when it first came out.  I remember my mom not letting me go to the movie lol.</UTT>It's pretty vulgar. What about Monty Python? Did you see that?</UTT>Yeah I used to watch all those old movies growing up.  Did you see the tribute they did for them?</UTT>I did not see that. When was that?</UTT>I guess whoever created the python programming language named it to honor them.</UTT>Good thing nobody put Python on the comedy channel or it would have been canceled.</UTT>Yeah that is probably true, good call.</UTT>Comedy Central. They should call Comedy Morgue. Anyway, I enjoyed chatting with you! Have a good day!</UTT>Yeah same here have a good one!
t_c56f0bef-4b4e-402c-9c0b-c4eec57214f1</CONV>Hey there how's it going. Do you believe in aliens? Apparently there's a possible UFO sighting during the flight on February 24.</UTT>I find it interesting, apparently a pilot saw a UFO over the Arizona desert</UTT>There seem to be a lot of UFO sightings over Arizona. But it's not all clear with the pilot saw.</UTT>It's kinda creepy the control center in Albuquerque didn't record anyone passing the plane</UTT>Yeah I agree. Who knows what he saw. There have also been a lot of sightings in Nevada. Almost 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government. Maybe they are experimenting.</UTT>Possibly, the US government investigates some of the UFO reports</UTT>Yeah I would think that they would. I wonder if they have found anything? Sometimes I have a hard time keeping information classified like their plans to destroy WikiLeaks.</UTT>I don't know, but the pilot gave a pretty good description of the UFO hovering above his plane</UTT>Yeah that is kind of interesting it sounded like he said that there was an aircraft in the front and he reported something passing over him but he didn't get much more specific than that. Saying it could've been a balloon maybe, maybe not.</UTT>The pilot did say the object has a big reflection and doubted it was a balloon</UTT>Oh interesting. And it was troubling several thousand feet above them going in the opposite direction. Very interesting.</UTT>Yea, it's interesting they air control asked it was a Google Ballon. I didn't know google did that type of stuff, I just thought they stuck to online advertising and search engines</UTT>Yeah it seems like Google does a lot more than just work on their search engines. They also calculate traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.</UTT>That doesn't sound like Google gets accurate traffic results considering a lot of people don't use android phones</UTT>That's a good point. A lot of people rely on Google. In to 2013 google went down for about five minutes and took 40% of web traffic with it.</UTT>That's a shame. It's crazy that google tailors it's maps to the claims of each country when there is a disputed border</UTT>Yeah that is quite interesting that they do that. They also hire a lot of goats to trim their lawn instead of hiring people to mow it. That's kind of funny.</UTT>It's pretty funny a company whose search engine requires more computing power than sending a man to the moon would do that</UTT>Yeah that's a very good point I'd like to learn more about that. I wonder what Neil Armstrong and the other 11 astronauts think about that.</UTT>Idk, it's pretty crazy though, like the man who was able to sell the Eiffel tower twice</UTT>Yeah that must've been a huge accomplishment for him. I can't even imagine selling it once LOL. Are use Google so much though I am just happy it was founded back in 1998. Was nice chatting with you see you later.
t_f17f5441-d291-4a6c-82df-88a7b1a7ed95</CONV>Do you like to read?</UTT>I do. Do you?</UTT>I enjoy it.  It is so relaxing!</UTT>Ditto. Do you have a favorite genre?</UTT>I like non-fiction.  Usually self development, mindset, or business like books.  You</UTT>Surprisingly, the same. I am reading the first 90 days now. I am switching jobs and needed some help.</UTT>That sounds like a good one.  One of my favorites is the subtle art of not giving a f_ _ _.  If you dont mind profanity.</UTT>I don't. Who wrote that?</UTT>Mark Manson.  It is a great book about really living your best life regardless of what others think.</UTT>I'll have to check it out. Is it fiction or non-fiction?</UTT>Non fiction.  I am surprised its not on the military reading lists.  Far better than enders game.</UTT>There was a moral panic in the 18th century so be thankful we don't have that.</UTT>For sure.  Reading is so valuable no matter what genre.</UTT>I agree. The world record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute!</UTT>I dont know my rate, but for sure it isnt anywhere near that fast.  That might be 5-10 minutes I am guessing?</UTT>Mine too! I was told to start smart with working out so I don't push my brain too hard.</UTT>However I think the you laugh you lose, poetry reading could be a lot of fun!</UTT>Unless you are the one being laughed at. And it's not just some schmoes laughing. It Lewis and Tolkien!</UTT>I would have loved to witness that!</UTT>Yeah. I always wanted to party with a few authors. Hemmingway for sure!</UTT>He would probably be fun, same with Dr Suess.</UTT>Yeah... It was nice chatting with you!
t_7775a6e9-dd34-4730-adfb-6578bcc5bbc4</CONV>Have you ever eaten popcorn with chopsticks?</UTT>No, how about you? Have you eaten it in any unconventional way?</UTT>No I have not.  But apparently you will find popcorn much more enjoyable if you do!  When you pay more attention to something enjoyable, they enjoy it more.</UTT>That's what the article said. I've thrown popcorn into the air and tried to catch it in my mouth. It did make eating popcorn fun. But I can't think of an unconventional way I've consumer water, can you?</UTT>There are lots of ways!  Shipping envelopes, pringles cans (though I prefer win those), even martini glasses.  Use your creativity!</UTT>I think I'd like to try an unconventional way to eat pizza instead. I don't think I would be very successful eating it with chopsticks, but blindfolded might be fun. Does that sound fun to you?</UTT>It could be - the restaurant which is pitch black could be interesting too - I have no idea how those waiters find the tables though</UTT>Ha, ha! So true! Did you enjoy learning the stuff about cars? I thought it was interesting why they call the trunk of your car a trunk. It seems so funny now!</UTT>Yes it does make sense.  I want to become a professional race car driver though - I am pretty good at video games</UTT>Are you really? I find driving in video games to be harder than driving on the road in a real car. I can see how it could help you with your driving skills.</UTT>Certainly there are a lot more obstacles to avoid in video games!  I rarely have boulders coming down the road at me.  Though the hardest part for teenagers is drive thrus</UTT>Thank goodness we don't have all those obstacles on the road coming at you! It's bad enough to get stuck in rush hour traffic!</UTT>Yes.  10 mph is easier to deal with than 100 for sure.  Though perhaps not in South Africa - where it is legal to have flame throwers on your car</UTT>Whoa! Don't mess with cars in South Africa! I think, though, I might like to try out that Dutch commuter bus they're creating that will travel at 160 mph.</UTT>Yes that does sound crazy!  I do want to travel to Europe - though Iceland does not have any trains - just airplanes to get from town to town</UTT>Europe would be fun. I don't think I would like to go to Iceland, trains or not, just because it sounds very cold!</UTT>Greenland is colder than Iceland!  Japan is expensive though - all of their highways are tolled</UTT>Yeah, that roll highway thing would be a pain in the neck! It would greatly increase your travel expenses. I think it would be cool to try out Mackinac island and travel the old fashioned way, by horse drawn carriages. That would be cool!</UTT>Yes a slow pace of life for sure.  I bet the Hawaiian king who was the first to travel the world had a slow pace of life as well.</UTT>It's funny, but the slow pace of life was how the world worked until recent times. Now we are very impatient, we want quick travel, instant access, all that.</UTT>Yes - and everything is online.  I could not live without my Reddit for social media.

Do you know why the trumpeteres have goatees?</UTT>Yes that is because it makes it playing mush more comfortable</UTT>Yeah . There is a woman who hosts jazz concerts in her place every day</UTT>Yeah that lady in Harlem, for 20 years now, impressive</UTT>I know right? Do you know which is the best jazz orchestra in the world?</UTT>Yes that is the Pakistani one, strange but cool</UTT>I know right? CLint Eastwood is also a huge fan of jazz it seems</UTT>Yes. do you like guitar as well?</UTT>Yes I do . Van Halen once set the speakers on fire by playing his</UTT>Yes he is that good I guess. Do you know who Brian May is?</UTT>Yes the lead guitarist of Queen and also a scientist</UTT>Yes and he never used a pick, just a coin</UTT>So cool. Pink floyd have a recording studio that is a boat actually</UTT>Why not right?Did you ever hear Hybrid Theory album?</UTT>Yes is it the best selling album of this century after all</UTT>Yes it is. Have you heard of Reel Big Fish, the band?</UTT>Yes that is the band that lost the rights to their music and rerecorded their hist after</UTT>Yes. Twins in Japan released a rap album when they were 100</UTT>Wow I wonder if it any good though, I would like to hear it</UTT>Me too actually, Nice chat
t_830cdc70-3afe-4025-a765-03d9877352fc</CONV>Hello, do you watch tv?</UTT>Hi yes I watch some TV. Do you use Netflix?</UTT>I watch some tv.  I use to have Netflix when it was mail based lol.</UTT>Did you know that they pay people to watch Netflix and tag the content?</UTT>I am not suprised.  There are stores on Amazon that to the same thing for reviews.  I understand they have 137 million subscribers now</UTT>That's a lot of subscribers. I don't watch enough TV to need to subscribe. If I want to watch something I get the DVD.</UTT>Speaking of DVDs, Blockbuster turned down the purchase of Netflix!</UTT>I didn't know that. I guess they feel like their doing well the way things are.</UTT>Netflix was started due to late fees from rentals!</UTT>I probably helped with that. I'm terrible remembering to return DVDs and books. Did you know netflix has an hour long video  of a fireplace.</UTT>I actually have that haha.  Netflix entered content production in 2012</UTT>I'll bet that's cool. I used to run a screensaver of a fish aquarium on my computer, sometimes things like that beat other movie content.</UTT>You can get the aquarium and fireplace on Youtube now.  Between them and Netflix, they account for 33% of traffic in north america.</UTT>Thanks for the info. I'll have to get those. Utube is my favorite video place to go to. I especially like the documentaries.</UTT>I meant to say 33% from 9-12 pm and half of peak internet traffic in north america, crazy!</UTT>Oh. Well either way it's a lot. Do you like Justin Bieber?</UTT>I am not a Bielivber!</UTT>Good pun. Me either. Some guy who had the same name was banned from facebook. Poor guy is a double loser.</UTT>Actually having his name makes him a celebrity and I am sure he gets views.  Anybody who get views gets paid!</UTT>I think that's probably why he got banned. But it doesn't seem fair. But Facebook isn't always fair.</UTT>Oh right!  I guess he can try instagram and twitter lol.  Nice talking to you. Take care</UTT>Same here. Have a good evening.</UTT>:)
t_4627f90c-fda9-497b-9433-da1001a0dae1</CONV>Do you like baseball?</UTT>I love baseball.  Opening day is only 2 weeks away</UTT>Only 2 weeks away wow I am really exited, I mostly watch the World Series though.</UTT>Well there have been some pretty memorable world series over the years.  It was first held in 1903</UTT>Wow so more than a hundred years since the first game. Did you like Babe Ruth?</UTT>I mean, I never saw him play live, but I do think he is one of the best ever.He helped make the Yankees a powerhouse</UTT>Yeah event the bests make mistakes he cost his team the title back in 1926</UTT>Yes, Babe tried to steal second base and it did not work out well</UTT>No it didn't work well at all. The Cubs were the first team to win the WS back to back, I guess that didnt work for them either</UTT>And that was the last time they won until 2016.  Quite the long layoff</UTT>Yeah, it seems like the team had a real curse on top of them, the Woman's World Cup had a higher rating that the World Series.</UTT>Well the World Cup does just come around every four years, so I can see how it would be popular on TV</UTT>I guess that makes sense still World Series is really popular in the states and woman's soccer team arent as popular.</UTT>Well baseball is not as popular as it was back in the day.  Too many things are competing for viewers time</UTT>I guess its not, there are a lot of sports out there, I do like the Yankees and the history the team has</UTT>They have the most wins in history by a large margin</UTT>Did you hear about Bill O'Reilly and how he invented a fake press organisation to get season tickets</UTT>He is a well known yankee fan.  I would not put it past him</UTT>Maybe he found another way to get tickets by now and what about Don Mattingly interesting how he got suspended</UTT>They have a strict dress and apperance code on the Yankees.  He should of gotten a haircut.</UTT>Yeah I wouldnt fight against the team and just get one already, anyway its been great chatting with you today.</UTT>You too.  Have a good one.
t_5976ba90-b2df-4915-a982-ff6be0cf4b7c</CONV>Hi, ya. I guess a knee injury forced Rafael Nadal out of the U.S. Open semi finals.</UTT>Yeah.  that is really sad.  He is such a talented player.</UTT>Right, I know. Del Port said that its not the best way to win a match and that would have loved to play against Rafa because hes the biggest fighter in the sport.</UTT>It is never great having something handed to you at that level.  It is more fun to earn it, so I see his point</UTT>Yep, I agree. I guess he typically doesn't like his knee taped up and his coach retaped it a few times and each time he tore it off. So eventually he had a limp and his speed was being effected and his knee was declining.</UTT>At least he believes he knows what is going on with it so he can rehab it faster</UTT>That is true and a good point. I guess he has suffered with tinnitus  for a while now and he's 33 years old.</UTT>It was projected that he would have a short career too.</UTT>Oh really, I didn't know that. He has proven people wrong with his work ethic and raw talent. Do you like any other types of entertainment?</UTT>I love old school video games!  You?</UTT>Yeah, I loved playing Nintendo. The system was discontinued in 2003.</UTT>It is sad!  That was classic! Even though there were only 54 colors that was the best!</UTT>Yeah, things have come so far now. It's almost unrecognizable. Entertainment has evolved and can be adapted to suit any scale now.</UTT>It really has.  Did you know someone once told Reagan he didnt look "presidential enough"</UTT>What! No way! That is crazy, lol. Not presidential enough I wonder who made that call? It was a bad one.</UTT>Yeah, they certainly didnt know what they were talking about.</UTT>I was recently watching an old match with Roger Federer. He was an amazing tennis player. He was born in 1981 and was a Swiss professional player who ranked 3rd in the world.</UTT>He along with Nadal and Djokovic account for 56% of Grand Slam titles</UTT>Man, that is something else. Wow, wait talent. It was in 2016 that Federer suffered the biggest injury to date and of his career. He stretched too far while drawing a bath for his child and tore his meniscus.</UTT>That is kind of crazy for an athlete.</UTT>Ya just never know when you may step wrong. Its very shocking though. I think its neat that they used to use a helicopter to dry the grass at the US Open tennis match.</UTT>I heard about that... kind of nuts.  Anyway Good chat!
t_ab5ecab0-914e-4232-946a-1d8e2e6734be</CONV>Hello! Do you like basketball?</UTT>Hi!Yes I do! I enjoy watching the Bulls. Do you have a favorite team?</UTT>I liked the seattle supersonics, but I'm not too into basketball to be honest. I find it interesting though. The science of it!</UTT>I agree, I only watch it if its on TV and I cant change the channel. There is alot of money in it, I think pays better than football. Like Allen Iverson, he gets lifetime time endorsements of 800, 000 a year until he is 55! I wish I had that!</UTT>Oh wow! I want that kind of money in my life! Haha! In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach! Maybe it's time I go into sports for my job !</UTT>me too! I agree, Im thought the same when I learned that! Since you like Science... there is a physicists that proved best techniques to shot and score.</UTT>Oh really? What's that?</UTT>Its called "Granny Style" haha but NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid! ha</UTT>Oh wow! I would do it! I have no shame! Haha! Granny style? Bring it on! Did you know that Air Jordans were banned upon introduction by the NBA?</UTT>I know right! I wouldn't either if they pay me in the millions or a potential of it haha and I didnt know that about the Jordans, I did know that Nike offered Lebron 90 million, shortly after reebok offered him 10 million that Lebron rejected! Who rejects 10 mil! Oh my Lordy!</UTT>Wow! It's a good thing he rejected though. He earned himself 80 million! Yeah I guess Jordan wore his Jordans anyway, because NIKE was willing to pay the fine each time! That worked well for them, I think!</UTT>I know!! Its almost like he expected it, but when you are that good I guess you expect it, its good business! I wouldn't have rejected probably unless I was coached into it. It makes sense though</UTT>Yeah I definitely wouldn't have rejected the first offer! Haha! $10 million? Okay, I'll do it! Sadly, I'm not like Tim Duncan, who sacrificed money to stay in college instead of going straight to the NBA.</UTT>I know right! That's what makes these people like Tim Duncan so amazing! Making mistakes but then also great choices! and in Lebrons case, Im glad he is humble, did you know he raised 6 million dollars for charity?</UTT>No I didn't! I admire charitable qualities in people. I only wish I had the resources to be able to be charitable! Woah! Apparently the New Zealand basketball team is nicknamed "the tall blacks". That's pretty crazy, I don't think that's very nice!</UTT>me too! Did you ever watch Space Jam? Im a 90's baby so it was my sham!!</UTT>Yeah, I have I loved that movie as a kid! I heard there might be a sequel. But I'm not sure if it's really going to happen. Wasn't it Lebron who was going to do the sequel?</UTT>Yes, apparently Lebron and Warner Bros signed a deal for a sequel, Itll be interesting to see for sure!</UTT>Yeah! I will absolutely be seeing it! Reminds me of my childhood. I see why Lebron is often called :The Best Basketball Player in the World! He is pretty great!</UTT>Agreed! Well Ill be thinking of you when I watch it too beautiful stranger! Take care! sending hugs, love and good vibes... Peace!
t_3372c714-eef9-4669-9880-240134872570</CONV>Do you like to watch tv?</UTT>Oh yeah. It's My favorite pastime. I like South PArk, Do you? I also like Simpsons.</UTT>I like South Park and the Simpsons, both were good.</UTT>Yeah, only one episode in SImpsons did not mention or have Bart on it. They had a great run with that show though.</UTT>Interesting, I don't know why that would occur, was the actor sick?</UTT>Good question, I don't know. I watched a lot of Pokemon episodes with the kids and they had over 750. They had so many that it could run for 16 years straight.</UTT>WOW! That is a lot of episodes isn't it. What about that 70s show, do you watch it?</UTT>Hmmm,  didn't watch it very much but I think they have a UK remake.</UTT>Yeah, I heard it failed and got canceled in 10 episodes. Hilarious.</UTT>Oh crazy. I would l like to visit the UK. The Prime MInister lives on Downing Street. He has a cat with the official title of chief mouse to the cabinet office. ;p;</UTT>Interesting, it seems like something that they would do in the UK.</UTT>Yeah, the cat had the daily duties of looking for mice and occupying the house to hunt for them. I like the Harry Potter books and films do you?</UTT>Interesting. Did you know if you turn 100 in Japan you get a silver cup to celebrate?</UTT>Oh I didn't know that , thats cool. I heard that they do a lot pranks over there too. For instance a radio station prank called the Queen.</UTT>Did they actually get through?</UTT>Yep, the did. They pretended to be the Canadian Prime Minister. This happened in 1995 so things might be a lot different now.</UTT>This is so funny. I wonder if they got in trouble?</UTT>I bet somebody knocked on their doors at some point.  Afterall, the Prime Minister is he head of the cabinet and the leader of the ministers in the executive branch of government. In many systems the Prime Minister selecs and may dismiss other members of the cabinet and they allocate posts to members. They prob dont like pranks.</UTT>Did you know that the president of indonesia has released 3 albums while in office?</UTT>What! That's a weird thing for a president to do. I wonder how he had time for that. I like our system and presidents jobs because they don't make music.</UTT>Yeah, maybe he was a musician before getting into office. Nice chatting with you.
t_0398f677-faab-45b7-b58d-a450c352b856</CONV>Do watch football very often?</UTT>I watch pro football. Are you familiar with Kellan Moore?</UTT>No I'm not who is that? Is he a quarterback for a team?</UTT>He is and he is the only left handed quarterback in the NFL.</UTT>Oh wow that is neat. I wonder if that makes him a better quarterback like being a lefty in baseball gives you an advantage.</UTT>Good question. Have you ever heard of Brad Johnson?</UTT>Nope. I don't know many individual players by name. I would probably recognize their picture though. What team does he play for?</UTT>He played for the Vikings. He is the only QB in history to throw a touchdown pass to himself!</UTT>How in the world do you throw a touchdown pass to yourself!?</UTT>I don't remember how it happened but it did. My guess is it got bobbled and he just happened to be in the right place at the right time.</UTT>Probably. It seems like there is a lot of pressure put on a GB even at the high school levels.</UTT>Yes there definitely is. Only two Super Bowl winning QB's were African American. That's surprising when so many players are black.</UTT>They do seem to stick white men in the GB position. I wonder how much racism is prevelent in the team structure given how racially charged our society is today.</UTT>That's a good question because I have also noticed that most QB's are white. Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's team?</UTT>That would be so cool. You would think with all this popularity that there would be more even distribution of the wealth to the players but it seems like the owners just line their pockets while the players only make a pittance. That must be why so many endorse products.</UTT>Endorsements seem to make a lot of money for players. I am very disturbed by the fact that across all US department of defense employees, the highest paid are three fottball coaches of service branch teams.</UTT>Hmm that does seem odd. I wonder why.</UTT>I don't know but I also know that the highest paid government employees in many states are college coaches so I think we are placing way too much emphasis on sports.</UTT>So true. I would love to see more emphasis on the arts. Can you imagine what would have been lost in the world of music if someone like say Micheal Jackson was pushed towards sports only instead of being allowed to sing?</UTT>I have a feeling his father would have pushed him into whatever he could have. I just recently discovered that he did not invent the moonwalk. That is so surprising to me.</UTT>That is surprising. It is so iconic to him. He was a unique and wonderful person though that changed the face of music forever.
t_437a69bb-29bf-4d41-9fd8-6daa15482014</CONV>Have you heard about the Sydney Loofe case?</UTT>The butcher of Tinder?  Unfortunately, yes. I guess they got him though.</UTT>It's an odd case. It's terribly sad that she just wanted to connect with someone and ended up murdered.</UTT>You cannot be too careful about reaching out to strangers. Good thing we are such old friends!  One wrong telephone call, snapchat conversation, or facebook frind, and you are worm fodder.</UTT>It's true. You just can't be sure if the person on the other side of the phone is a good person. I wonder if the murder was premeditated or just...happened.</UTT>I don't know. Deadly phone calls are creeping me out. You know, the inventor of the dial telephone was an undertaker. I heard creepy music playing as I typed that...</UTT>I had no idea!  I rarely use my phone for phone calls anymore. The sheer amount of computing power the iphone has kind of blows my mind.</UTT>I blame 1930s actress, Hedy Lamarr--who supposedly had something to do with  the inventio0n of cellphones</UTT>She was an amazing genius. I think she'd be stunned to see how far we've come with technology. Can you believe that the cables that cross the ocean for internet and phone data are just 2.7 inches around? Mind blowing.</UTT>Have you ever dialed a wrong number that turned out to be a dolphin? Apparently, they can communicate over the phone!</UTT>I'm sure they have a lot to say! I think I'd like that. I know that phones are optimized for the human voice, but I'd be happy to talk to a dolphin.</UTT>The sound a lot like a fax machine...but those underwater cables must have been crossed.  Sounds like fantasy!</UTT>Indeed! I love fantasy- people do fantasy drafts for everything. The national spelling bee, congress, football.</UTT>Fantasy draft sounds like that cold breeze that causes the hair on your neck to stand up while watching Lord of the Rings! You know, the Return of the King was the only fantasy film to win an Academy Award?</UTT>I had no idea. That was an excellent movie. Tolkien was a great writer (Sometimes), but I prefer Terry Pratchett. He was knighted!</UTT>Ah, but can you major in Pratchett in college?  There is a university where you can major in fantasy with a concentration in Tolkien studies.</UTT>Oh wow! I could have done really well in that! It's amazing how fantasy has been embraced in so many different media types. It's gone from written and spoken word to tv and movies and video games.</UTT>And with puppets too! Did you ever watch Jim Henson's, The Dark Crystal?</UTT>I loved it! It's got such a vivid universe.</UTT>Reminds me of Hans Christian Anderson's dark tales to spook your children!</UTT>I wonder if children have difficulty figuring out if something is fantasy or reality? Apparently it's all predicated by a one fold in the brain!</UTT>Yeah, and one fold too many, and you are a Tinder butcher. Nice chatting with you!
t_c85ebdba-3c3f-4b33-881d-cccda5fc20fb</CONV>What entertainment do you enjoy?</UTT>Lots. Love to go to museums, movies, you name it. By chance, have you ever been to Washington, DC? With kids? Or would you like to visit?</UTT>I have been to DC only once. Don't remember much about it anymore though</UTT>Got it. Don't remember much from class trip there. Went back, though, with my own kids yrs. later. We all loved, of all places, the Museum of Natural History, where they say life-sized (stuffed) packs of wolves, a coyote, bison, moose, and a grizzly standing 12 ft. up on its hind legs. My son said, Whoa!</UTT>I agree and I remember being impressed myself. I went there for a school trip in my youth</UTT>Now we're talking. On a DC Dream Day, I'd also go to the Kennedy Center (not yet built my class trip year). Any other special places you'd go?</UTT>What is dream day?</UTT>Just an expression for things you'd really like to do on a special day out in DC. Could be any sight or entertainment venue you like. Make more sense?</UTT>Well it is worth going to all the famous government buildings at least once if you have never been</UTT>Agreed. I like free, no admission fee, places. Couldn't afford, say, $120 to see a play. How about you?</UTT>I hear the winter tale is a play worth watching</UTT>Shakespeare's comedy, yes, but it has some not-so-funny bits in it, too. Sadly, a ticket to a live play, which I'd love to see, is not in my budget anymore. A fun, new movie, like Incredibles II, is more like it. Have you seen it?</UTT>I have, great movie btw</UTT>Haven't seen it, yet, but want to. Really liked Samuel L. Jackson's job of voicing a character in the original 2004 movie.</UTT>Have you seen the original?</UTT>Yes. Also saw kids playing Incredibles follow-up video game.</UTT>Really? Do you remember its name?</UTT>"Rise of the UnderMiners". Sometimes I like a movie that's a comedy, but not an animated film. Do you have a favorite film that makes you laugh?</UTT>I like kung fu hustle or what we do in the shadows</UTT>Did you know KF Hustle is Bill Murray's favorite film? My favorite B. Murray comedy is Groundhog Day. Admit I watch every Feb. 2nd, or thereabouts, and still giggle.</UTT>I like kungfu hustle, short history or nearly everything, austin powers, and what we do in the shadow. I hope you check out some of these and will enjoy them. Thanks for chatting.
t_f4996f06-7e1a-4fcc-b240-5765684731a9</CONV>I believe that service dogs are such a necessity for the handicapped.</UTT>Yes it helps veterans and individuals with handicaps be more independent.</UTT>I agree. Recently Disney Land had a service dog field trip. The outing was organized by Canine Companions who raises adn trains service dogs. They even gave the dogs Mickey Mouse eats.</UTT>And poor Pluto got jealous because the dogs were allowed to roam free at Disneyland.</UTT>Ha ha yes. I believe it was a very nice gesture on the part of Disney Land. I would have loved to have seen that. It sounds adorable.</UTT>Sure does. Have you ever been to the Walt Disney Studios?</UTT>No I have not. It sounds like a good time though. Have you?</UTT>No but I would like to one day when I am in Burbank, CA.</UTT>I'm much further away so it would be more difficult. Did you ever watch American Choppers?</UTT>I have heard of it but never watched it since I don't get Discovery Channel.</UTT>I see. Well apparently it has returned to popular culture and there is even a meme featuring shouting between the stars.</UTT>That's interesting. I prefer Disney films instead.</UTT>I do too but it's difficult not to see the most popular memes if you are on social media. Users have been using the scene of the argument to form their own memes including ridiculous arguments, philosophical debates, and more.</UTT>Do you like animation films like those produced by Pixar?</UTT>I do. It's not my favorite genre but I do enjoy them from time to time. I liked Wall-E.</UTT>Bambi was my first animated movie. Disney used a special camera to make it look realistic.</UTT>Really? I was not aware of that. Do you know anything about how it was different? I can't remember what my first animated movie was.</UTT>Well the camera is supposed to change the speed and distance of moving pieces but it's been so long since I've watched it to remember specifically.</UTT>That's very interesting. I did recently find out that Wreck-It-Ralph started development in the late 80's. That's so shocking to me. I wonder how many rewrites were needed just based on how many characters are in it that spanned so long after.</UTT>That is interesting. I understand why Walt Disney Pictures is called one of Hollywood's Big Six.</UTT>Yes especially recently with all of their acquiring of properties.
t_5c2d1b29-4d34-4d98-9194-e903780fcdec</CONV>hi, do you travel?</UTT>I do, both for work and business. I'm usually always on the go. I wish I had that commuter bus that the Dutch are creating that goes 160mph.</UTT>yeah that sounds pretty interesting I would like to try that one</UTT>They say that all of Japan's highways have a toll. It cost more than $300 to travel across the country.</UTT>Yeah that is pretty expensive but their roads are really good so there you go</UTT>Yeah they probably put all that money back into infrastructure of the roads.</UTT>yeah. in iceland there is no rail service</UTT>I wonder how far it is between major cities. Most people fly, but I bet there's plenty of people who never leave their towns.</UTT>yeah and it is a small country so the flights are probably short too</UTT>Probably so, I'd love to visit there.</UTT>yeah me too. Do you know who is the first king to travel the world?</UTT>Wasn't it King Kalakaua of Hawaii?</UTT>Yeah that was him. I am supposing it was by ship</UTT>Probably so, that would be a long travel. They say that most people from Mackinac Island travel by horse-drawn carriages or bikes. They have banned motorized vehicles from there for over 100 years.</UTT>that must be a very quiet place to enjoy nature</UTT>I bet it's peaceful and clean. They're probably really healthy there.</UTT>yeah. do you watch much soccer?</UTT>I don't usually, but I do like watching the World Cup.</UTT>nice. do you have a favorite team or just watch the games?</UTT>I mainly just watch the games. I like to see Team USA win if possible.</UTT>Yeah that are not that great but you never know. nice chat
t_e7db0b5b-8bd8-4ced-b767-20f4117774df</CONV>do you like the NFL?</UTT>I sure do. Did you know that women can play in it as well?</UTT>Yes there is no written rule that says that they cannot play</UTT>Yes , if they qualify they are then good to play like the rest</UTT>Yeah. The average gameplay is only 11 minutes after all</UTT>Yeah but we are glued to the tv for forever for a game</UTT>Yeah. Engineers make more over the lifetime than footballers</UTT>Yes they also have longer careers though so maybe that helps there</UTT>True good point. Did you hear of that rule for the Saints cheerleaders?</UTT>Yes they are not allowed to eat in the same place as the players</UTT>Yes and they have to leave mid meal if they walk in somewhere</UTT>Yes it is sexist and it needs to go really</UTT>I agree. Do you like Brady at all?</UTT>Yes I do. Did you know he was a back up QB in high school?</UTT>Yes and he never got started although the team was doing really poorly</UTT>Their loss I guess. Did you know ALex Smith finished college in two years?</UTT>Yes he took lots of ap tests in high school, really planned for it</UTT>Yeah and he started his masters before he was even picked in the draft</UTT>Yeah. Do you know who invented the circular huddle?</UTT>Yes it was Paul Hubbard who was deaf and did not want the other team to understand him.</UTT>Yes that was very smart of him. Nice chat
t_fea1bdc2-6c0a-45ff-ac88-2d3b5be95fc5</CONV>Are you into FIFA World Cup soccer?</UTT>Hi there, yes I watch the World Cup. Do you know where it will take place in 2022?</UTT>I heard the final will be in Qatar but FIFA doesn't exist there yet.</UTT>Yeah it is interesting that they do not even have a city for the Cup, maybe they are building an entire city for that</UTT>Strange indeed... Build it and they will come... I didn't know that the U.S. placed 3rd in the first FIFA world cup in 1930.  Can't believe it goes back that far.</UTT>Yeah it sure goes back in time. US women's team seems to be doing better though as they never placed under third</UTT>Yep.  Did you know there is a variation of soccer where 3 teams play at the same time?</UTT>I would actually like to see how that game is played. I am curious about it.</UTT>That would be entertaining.  Speaking of entertainment, I heard the Nintendo NES could only display 54 colors.</UTT>I loved NIntendo. TOo bad it was discontinued in 2003 in Japan</UTT>Disappointment is a part of life like when Ronald Reagan was rejected for a movie role for not having that "presidential look."</UTT>Hahhaha go figure Good for him though, proved them wrong by becoming a real president</UTT>Funny that Bill Nye got his start in entertainment by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest.</UTT>Haha that is actually very funny, the guy is a legend now.</UTT>Caesar is a legend too.  He once visited Britain and was surprised that people bred chickens for entertainment and not food.</UTT>Go figure, I wonder what he thought of them. Back to soccer, did you hear about that German soccer player who donated all his World CUp winnings?</UTT>Yes, Mesut Ozil made it possible for 23 kids in Brazil to get needed surgeries.</UTT>SO heartwarming, good for him. Even Jon Steward was a soccer player and represented the US</UTT>Yeah.  I was surprised to learn that the term "soccer" was a slang word for Association Football.</UTT>Yeah did not know that either. They are the richest players in the world though.</UTT>Yep.  You've been an excellent chat partner.  Thanks!
t_55d25cde-3c49-4f63-a3c7-d2eb5faceaf3</CONV>hi, do you know much about the president?</UTT>Well, I think i am learning more everyday. I respect the office of the presidency. I visited to White House an noticed how much larger the guest house seemed to be. I was looking from far away though.</UTT>yeah that is strange, maybe they just get a lot of guests</UTT>Hmmm, that is an observation for sure. I am fascinated by the wealthy presidents which were JFK, Washington and Jefferson. Do you know anything about the presidency?</UTT>I know the president of indonesia is a pop artist</UTT>Oh really? How stange for sure. The first president of zimbabwe had the nickname Banana. What a hoot. I don't know how to take a president serious with a nickname like Banana. It reminds me of a kids song.</UTT>Yeah they guy went on to release three albums</UTT>Release albums? Weird. The U.S used to have some interesting procedures for electing the president. The runner up was automatically the vice pres. until 1805 when it changed and became the way it is today.</UTT>Yeah glad it changed otherwise I could not see Trump and Clinton working with each other</UTT>No, that would not be a good match, infact. I totally agree with you on that.</UTT>do you use your computer much?</UTT>Yeah, I use it all the time. I use programs all the time too. I use my microwave everyday and that is because a computer controls it. Computers are every I look in my house. Robots and computers-aided designs are in most every electronic now.</UTT>that is very true. did you know apple voidds the warranty if you smoke near their computers</UTT>I have never heard of that, hmmm? That must be in the small print. It must be because smoking is a biohazard of sorts.</UTT>yeah I think that is the reason too but I had not heard of it before either</UTT>Pretty interesting for sure. I learned that someone built a working computer from 16-bit computer using nothing but the basic minecraft building blocks, truly amazing. A long time ago in 1936 the russians also built a computer that ran on water. The race to build computers was on.</UTT>and it still seems to be. do you listen tot he radio much?</UTT>I often listen to a website that has thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas and its all for free. I appreciate the fact that the website offers it for free.</UTT>yeah me too that is really nice. you can also catch Jupiter's storms on the radio</UTT>I have enjoyed that recently. I wish I could understand the latin channel. Since 1989 a finnish radio station has broadcast 'nuntii latini'</UTT>that is amazing wonder how many listeners they have. nice chat
t_c6befc24-1cef-4436-a56f-cb1eb7398fdb</CONV>Hello there, do you attend many music concerts?</UTT>I do, I prefer live concerts to not live.</UTT>Yeah same here, I used to go quite a bit but not so much these days.  What was your favorite concert ever?</UTT>I like pink floyd. They apparently recorded a live concert at the roman amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience.</UTT>I am a fan too, but mostly of their first album.  I have seen some footage, it looked so cool.</UTT>Interesting. Well apparently Creed is so terrible that attendees of their concerts, that they got sued.</UTT>I read that as well.  I think that's pretty sad.  If you don't like it, don't buy a ticket next time.</UTT>Well in Croatia there is a roman amphitheater that is still used today.</UTT>I think that is so cool, I would love to see someone play in that venue.</UTT>Yeah, it would be cool to see it. Did you know that 1886 was regarded as the birth year for the modern car?</UTT>I think I have read that before, wasn't it a German inventor as well?</UTT>I believe it was Karl Benz to be honest. Pretty cool.</UTT>Good call, yeah very cool.  And then, thanks to Mr. Ford, the car years later became mass produced and widely available.</UTT>Apparently it is legal to put a flamethrower on your car in South Africa.</UTT>That sounds like a real life version of Grand Theft Auto, or better yet Twisted Metal!</UTT>Yeah, pretty crazy! Do you like U2 the band?</UTT>They are pretty good, I would say their earliest stuff is probably the best.  How about you?</UTT>Yeah, I like the first few albums, but I admit I haven't listened to them in a long time.</UTT>Oh yeah I haven't heard those albums in forever, I know my older brother was into them as well.</UTT>Well apparently they played country music wearing wigs once in texas.</UTT>That is probably the best thing I have ever heard about them.  Nice chatting with you, hope you have a good day.
t_8ddb4470-9eb8-4924-aa89-3f4cf7053dc8</CONV>hello my friend do you know who the top 3 richest us presidents were?</UTT>Hello, I dont know, maybe Tump, Obama and Clinton?</UTT>well it is apparnetly JFK Jefferson and Washington, they must have take inflation into account</UTT>Yeah, or maybe they just had a lot of land, Trump may be also hidding certain aspects of his actual wealth</UTT>ya that is true, I think he shoudl do like the president of indonesia and make some pop albums haha</UTT>That could help him reach place 3 lol, maybe he can get to place 1 if he did like 12 of them while in office.</UTT>haha good point! He could make the record with Kanye! and do it in the guest house which is bigger than the white house!</UTT>He sure can, i bet it would be a hit, everybody would watch it regardless of how bad it is who knows maybe it can be the hit of the century.</UTT>haha it could be amazing!  did you hear the president of Zimbabwe is literally called President Banana?</UTT>Really Banana? That's an interesting name</UTT>ya it sounds like it, did you hear of the presidential rule change they did back in 1805?</UTT>No I didnt, what was different back in 1805¡</UTT>ya the runner up became VP, imagine VP Hilllary right now and the drama that would cause!</UTT>We would have a civil war at the White House everyday, that is a sure fact lol, not a good combination.</UTT>nope not at all, only thing I could see is if they both worked together and did a pop album like the indonesia pres, then maybe we could come together as a country! haha!</UTT>Yeah they could work on a country hit album for sure lol, do you consider yourself a republican?</UTT>well I don't really fit into any political party, what about you?</UTT>Not really Im more of a Democrat but dont really care that much either way, you know that every US president with a beard has been a republican, thats an interesting stat.</UTT>ha that is interesting, and ya there hasn't been a president who wasnt a dem or republican since about 1853, thats a pretty long time</UTT>It is, I guess the other parties dont have the influence or power the Democrats and Republicans have, the blue and red colors seem to be the only ones that matter.</UTT>ya I guess, weird that they only started using blue and red in the year 2000, seems like theyve always used it in my lifetime</UTT>Yeah its been 19 years but it does seem longer than that, you know that Tuman visited Disneyland and rejected Dumbo, I bet the poor little elephant felt bad after that</UTT>haah poor dumbo! and ya he didn't want to be associated with elephants aka republicans, maybe Trump wont take pictures with Eeyore? haha</UTT>Yeah poor Dumbo didnt even know lol and yeah I bet Trump wouldnt,</UTT>don't think so, if dems want to beat him they should run a basketball player, the taller person wins 75% of the time!

Speaking in great teams, I like Duncan from the Spurs</UTT>Yeah,  didnt he retire recently?  Hes been playing forever,  since I was in high school.</UTT>He did, when he played, he sacrificed money for his teammates to stay, which is a very rare move</UTT>what do you mean he sacraficed money for his teammates to stay?</UTT>There is a limit to how much money a team can spend on players, and he was worth a lot of money, but did not demand it</UTT>Oh I see.  That is very nice of him.  He also stayed in college for 4 years instead of going straight to the nba.</UTT>yes, that one I do not personally agree with though</UTT>Oh really,  why not?</UTT>Well it is off topic, but I think college basketball and football are finely tuned machines to make money for schools and pay no money to the athletes who risk their health and well being</UTT>right.  Did you know new zealand has a team called the tall blacks?</UTT>I did, that seems sort of insensitive these days</UTT>Yeah really weird</UTT>I found it interesting that the losing-est coach in U of K history is the inventor of basketball, talk about a run of dominance</UTT>I know right,  thats kinda weird.  Maybe its true,  if you cant do...teach.</UTT>that is true, and sometimes you are just too good, Like Kareem getting the dunk banned in college basketball</UTT>Yeah!  Thats kinda messed up,  but I guess to even the playing field.</UTT>I suppose so, some may see it as neutralizing skill though</UTT>i recently read some fun facts about humans,  did you know we can regrow a rib that has been surgically removed?</UTT>I did know that, very interesting that it takes only a few months as well!</UTT>Yeah,  well its been good chatting!!

It's been long time now.</UTT>It is the only known astronomical object to harbor life</UTT>Yes it is.  About 71% of the Earths surface is covered with water.</UTT>The remaining 29% is land consisting of continents and islands</UTT>Yes!  The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice.  I think the ice packs have been shrinking in recent years.</UTT>Yes sadly. Just like the fact Earth will be helium free in the near future</UTT>Sad indeed.  Another sad fact is more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed.</UTT>We have changed the earth so much in our short time. But did you know that if earths history were a 24 hour period we would only account for 1:17 mins</UTT>That makes me feel like a tiny ant. lol  When Earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.</UTT>I wish work days would go by that fast! There would be a lot more days though. I like our 365 days</UTT>Yes!  Wouldn't that be nice.  Do you know much about Mars?</UTT>It is the second smallest planet in the solar system</UTT>Interesting!  Due to differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.</UTT>Maybe that's where all our helium ends up!</UTT>lol  A Mars colonization project planned for 2023 will be funded by creating a reality tv show.</UTT>I hope its more interesting than the reality tv shows on now. Would be neat to see space stuff</UTT>It would be.  I would like to see some lichens and cyanobacteria because they would be able to thrive on Mars. lol  It was fun chatting!</UTT>Flying to mars could taking only 1-2 days with constant 1g acceleration</UTT>I would take the trip!  Have to get running.  Have a great day!

Do you know how Cadillac got its name?</UTT>That is crazy that flame throwers are allowed on cars in south africa to prevent car jacking</UTT>I know, pretty insane. Cadillac got its name from the founder of detroit whose last name was Cadillac</UTT>What was your first car? Mine was an ugly green ford torino with a white vinyl top. It used more oil than gas</UTT>Wow that sounds old. I have a Nissan, small car. Do you know how the drive thru came about?</UTT>wow! earth will be virtually helium free by the 21 century, I did not know that, guess no more crazy talking from breathing in helium balloons</UTT>Hahaha I guess not. It is sad on the other hand that we have destroyed so much of the forested areas of the earth</UTT>yeah 80% how can that be? I'm not so sure I believe that</UTT>Well I would not be surprised but it does seem a lot for sure. Did you know when earth was formed the days were only 5.5 hours?</UTT>that would make for a short work day. Ahh...the good ole days.</UTT>Yeah that is just too short, living in the dark. DO you believe in Extraterrestrials?</UTT>It's hard for me to believe that there is nothing or nobody out there. To quote the movie, Contact, seems like a big waste of space</UTT>Yeah it is a big space indeed. Well in case they make contacts with us, UN has appointed an ambassador to deal with them</UTT>how does one qualify for that position? Do you think the other ambassadors laugh at this person behind their back?</UTT>I have no idea how that works really. Do you like playing chess?</UTT>I used to play when younger</UTT>Nice. THere are less atoms in the universe than there are chess moves</UTT>am I reading that correctly about the 2007 study? So, a lower IQ correlates to better chess skill?</UTT>Yeah it seems that way.

He has a device that he patented for his lean move!</UTT>I think I heard about that, very interesting.  He was the king of dance moves in his prime in my opinion.</UTT>I agree 100%. Ballet dancers can go through 4 shoes per week!</UTT>That is crazy!  I wonder what their feet look like, most likely pretty rough.</UTT>Yeah so much stress they have to take! I think its cute babies spontaneously dance when they hear music.</UTT>That is funny, I wonder if it starts when they are still in the womb?</UTT>Yes good question. Tupac was a dancer too and he did ballet in high school!</UTT>I think I have heard that, sounds pretty cool to me, I wonder if there is a Youtube video of that out there.</UTT>I should go check! He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker!</UTT>That is awesome!  I'm sure he is proud of his mouse king past lol.</UTT>haha yes he is. Bruce Lee was also a famous dancer, still surprising but more expected than Tupac!</UTT>Yeah more expected for sure, he could really move around effortlessly in his movies.</UTT>He is so quick and agile! I would love to get a selfie with him on my iphone! The first generation iphone was released in 2007, i still remember that moment!</UTT>I think you are right I remember when they did. I know 10 years later the app store has over 2 million apps!</UTT>Amazing evolution. Did you know woman are more likely to own iphones than men?</UTT>I have never heard that fact, very odd.  Do you use an iphone yourself?</UTT>Yes I do and I am a man so I guess I break that sterotype! I have never played the iphone game "send me to heaven" though.Maybe that explains why my iphone is still intact lol. Great talking with you!</UTT>That is way funny!  I wonder how many people played that game and destroyed their phone.</UTT>I think it's good that Apple banned it. The app creator seemed to want to create havoc lol. I hope you have a good rest of your evening!</UTT>Yeah same here, sounds pretty dumb and a waste.  Same to you thanks!
t_b9e9a8e2-8ed1-471c-bdbb-189765cf46cd</CONV>Hi, how are you?</UTT>I've been thinking about birds a lot lately.    Do you know anything about their anatomy?</UTT>I don't really know much about birds. I have heard that they have hollow bones.</UTT>True.  I've been reading about their high metabolic rate and four chambered heart.</UTT>I'm astonished that birds can fly from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping. I guess their brains must not require sleep.</UTT>They are really amazing.     Some wild birds in australia can mimic cameras, car alarms and chainsaws!</UTT>I'm amazed that their vocal cords can do what machines do. Hummingbirds make use of spider webs to build nests.</UTT>Well, anything that can evolve from a pigeon to a dodo bird must be very adaptive!</UTT>I guess every species needs to evolve and adapt. Humans do so as well. They have lost their body hair (or most of it) relatively recently.</UTT>True, and considering how government works, governing an organized community, humans need to be versatile, mentally and physically</UTT>True. Consider the guy in France that sold the Eiffel Tower twice by impersonating a government official.</UTT>That is nuts.     Perhaps the US government will actually sell Nevada, since they own nearly 90% of the state.</UTT>I think they control most of it for military purposes and such. They could sell the land and donate the proceeds to helping save the Amazon rainforest, just like Norway did.</UTT>I thought it might have something to do with their immunity from violating the geneva convention.</UTT>They probably need that immunity now, with Wikileaks telling a lot of government secrets.</UTT>True.    I heard Wikileaks published the governments plan to destroy Wikileaks.</UTT>I wonder how the government could destroy Wikileaks, which probably has lots of backups and hidden sites.</UTT>Perhaps they can use the fact humans are among the best distance runners!</UTT>We've very good at spreading out into new environments. But we still cannot synthesize vitamin C.</UTT>Yes, evolution sometimes results in things like a defective enzyme.</UTT>Well, I enjoyed chatting with you! Make sure you get plenty of vitamin C.</UTT>Thanks!    Stay away from the frequency that causes fear in humans!
t_7db2ac78-cfef-4f04-b147-49000b65eedc</CONV>Hey what do you think about Hope Hicks? She recently met with President Trump</UTT>I honestly don't remember a lot about her because she left the administration a while ago. I know that when she was there she met with investigators about Russian election meddling.</UTT>That's what I remember too. And I guess Mike Rogers says that Trump has not told his Department to mess with the Russia investigation which is interesting</UTT>That is very interesting and concerning. Do you know a lot about presidential trivia?</UTT>Yes I know some things about it, for instance the top three richest presidents are Jefferson, Washington, and also JFK</UTT>That is very interesting. Did you also know that the guest house is larger than the white house? I wonder why they did that?</UTT>Yes that doesn't make any sense! It also doesn't make sense why the president of Indonesia released three pop albums, you would think he'd have more important things to do</UTT>I heard that he did that while he was in office. That makes it even stranger than if it wore before or after.</UTT>Yep it is very strange. It's also strange that our old system would have the runner-up of the presidential election become the vice president, talk about weird</UTT>Wow! Can you imagine that happening now?</UTT>No that would be crazy with Vice President Clinton and president Trump, that would be so much drama lol</UTT>I agree. We are far too partisan for that now. Did you ever heard what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?</UTT>I think they call him president banana right? I wonder if he want his election fair and square or if he used bananas to get him elected LOL</UTT>Ha ha. What a strange name. Do you know a lot about elections?</UTT>I know a little bit about elections yes, did you know that in 2012 international election observers were blocked from visiting the polls in 9 of the states</UTT>What?! That's unacceptable. I wonder how that was justified?</UTT>Yeah I don't know, and I don't know why they would not have been admitted, what do you think about the fact that in 75% of presidential elections, the taller candidate has won</UTT>I did not but I would be interested to see a study for the reasoning behind that. Do we gravitate towards taller people subconsciously?</UTT>I think so, it must be built into our genes, what do you think about the fact that Nevada lets you choose a"none of these candidates"voting option when you vote</UTT>That seems strange. Can't people just leave it blank if they want like they do everywhere else?</UTT>Yep we're just not vote at all, it's very silly I think but it's interesting on the last, isn't it sad though that the maximum voter turnout in the United States has been about 63%</UTT>Very sad. I can't imagine why people don't take it more seriously. Many of them usually have opinions to but don't want to go out and do anything about it.
t_2771580b-0c0d-482b-b09a-5babd27db6c0</CONV>Hello there, do you like music?</UTT>Hi there I do like music. I like most everything except country. What about you?</UTT>Nice, yeah I like a little bit of everything too. DO you like and listen to rap a lot?</UTT>I listen to rap sometimes. It's not my favorite but they do have some good songs. What about you? I know a lot of people like Tupac</UTT>Yeah I like Tupac and his music is in the library of congress</UTT>Yep that's impressive! Apparently it's there because of the cultural significance. Do you like Busta Rhymes to?</UTT>I like him too. He voiced the reptar wagon in the rugrats movie</UTT>Haha yes he did. I'm going to have to watch that movie again LOL it's been a long time. Have you ever heard of a "compliment battle"</UTT>Yeah that is the one that they practice in South Korea where they compliment each other</UTT>Yep you're right. I want to do a compliment battle with someone LOL did you hear about the Michigan judge who gave her rulings Eminem, she did it in the form of a rap. She has too much time on her hands LOL</UTT>Hahah I agree there, I wonder if people thought it was a joke. DO you like Eminem?</UTT>Haha he's ok. I don't think his new stuff is very good but I did listen to him back when I was in high school haha. What do you do for entertainment?</UTT>Well he originally wanted to be a comic book artist, so wonder how they could have gone. I like to play video games, and you?</UTT>I do like to play video games. I played the Nintendo Entertainment System back in the day. We called it the NES. Apparently it only display 54 colors, did you know that?</UTT>I did not know that, that is interesting. Too bad is was discontinued in 2003 in Japan</UTT>Yep I agree with you. I'm just glad we live in present-day where we have access to video games. And we don't live back in 50 BC where people are using chickens for entertainment LOL</UTT>Yeah I wonder what Caesar thought about that when he was visiting there and came upon this</UTT>Haha yep he probably thought they are crazy. Have you heard of Bill Nye the Science Guy? He got started in the entertainment business by doing a Steve Martin look-alike contest and I think he won</UTT>That is crazy but I do like the guy a lot. Even Reagan wanted to be an actor once when he auditioned for the role of the president and did not get it</UTT>Haha that's funny. I think they told him that he didn't have"that presidential look"how wrong they were</UTT>Hahaha yeah. at least he became a real president. Nice chatting with you :)
t_a5819a6d-9b1d-4ce3-928a-a52cea8af3c0</CONV>I just recently heard about a tearless onion variety called "Sunions".  Have you?</UTT>No, I have not. Tearless onions? I guess that must be an important advancement for mankind. Who created them?</UTT>Bayer Crop Science and Ohio State University.   Apparently they are a hybrid and a GMO modified root crop.  So, that should make the ant-GMO-ers happy.</UTT>Most of our food has been modified in one way or another. Tearless onions don't sound that bad though.</UTT>Hybridization has been going on for centuries - GMO is relatively new.  What I find interesting is the compound that causes crying, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, is a defensive mechanism against being eating.  I never thought plants could evolve that way - its almost like they have a mind of their own!</UTT>Hybrids are a modification of genes, just not done at the cellular level. I suppose there are risks, but people have not eaten food as it was in nature for centuries. I am not worried about GMO. Climate change? Yes.</UTT>GMO and hybrids can sometimes have unintended consequences.  That's why I support a heritage seed bank at our local university and let them have a research plot on my land to grow / reestablish a natural prairie ecosystem.  Back to the onion, it also apparently has no after taste.  That would be a big change from creole onions growing in my garden!</UTT>I guess for some businesses, the GMO onion would be useful for their product. Like fast food restaurants. I think that it's good to preserve seeds because they contain information.</UTT>Agree.  I going to have to see if my feed store can get me sunsions seed onions.  They grow them in Washington and Nevada.  I am not sure how they will grow in Louisiana, but its worth a try.  If the feed store can't get them, then maybe I can find seed Sunions on the internet.  Do you do much shopping on the internet?</UTT>I do some shopping on the Internet. I sometimes go on Amazon if I can't find something elsewhere or I need it in a hurry. You?</UTT>It's 40 miles to a big city.  I support my local feed & seed, butcher, and grocery store, etc.  But if I can't find it locally, then I will buy online before driving 40 miles.  The added cost of driving (fuel and time) to the city is not worth it when added to the cost of the item.  I shop on Amazon a lot.  Have you read their terms and conditions?</UTT>I have not read their terms. I figure that they are selling browsing and purchasing data if they can make money off it.</UTT>It seems like only 7% of people read the terms when buying online.  That's why I stick to Amazon and a few select vendors - the terms can vary widely.  The internet has changed life, even in rural areas.  But it can also be addictive.  Did you know that they measure the addition in the brain from constant clicking?</UTT>I bet we're all getting addicted. 7% ? I thought it would be lower. I'm surprised anyone reads those. Usually they just want to use the service.</UTT>I guess that is a fault we have as humans - we can at time be too trusting rather than taking the time to assess the situation.  Did you know that of all animals and plants, humans are the only ones who cannot synthesis their own vitamin C?</UTT>It hasn't seemed to hurt us much, though I guess we could get GM humans that have the ability.</UTT>I would rather eat Satsuma oranges off the trees in the back yard.  Thankfully we have the intelligence to include food sources in our diet that are rich in Vitamin C and have developed the tools and techniques to cultivate and grow those.  Do you eat much fish?  I know some health experts recommend including fish as a lean protein source.</UTT>Yes, fish can be good for that. Fish also is a source of a lot of pollutants such as mercury because of biological magnification. I don't know if we can GM fish to be safer. I know that farming has changed their genes.</UTT>Well, I read that a lot of supermarket fish can be mislabeled.  So I rather catch my own (fresh or salt water) or go to the docks and buy it straight off the boat.  Did you know that their is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  A bit scary!!!  How do you contain the population of something that is immortal?  I guess with predators since they do not die.</UTT>It sounds like you're invested in food safety. That's smart! Most people don't have the time, I find. They might pay a price for that. I wouldn't want to be immortal. What would you do? Watch reruns? Engineer new kinds of onions?</UTT>Living in rural areas, we treat food differently.  If we are having chicken for supper, then it was running free in the backyard yesterday.  We do have a closer relationship with our food.  Fish is the one primary food source I do not grow so I have to catch or buy.  What I find scary is that 84% of the human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish.  I wonder if scientist have an explanation for that?</UTT>We are all pretty closely linked because nature found solutions to situations that remain useful and get passed on. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Same to you.  Its Mardi Gras here.  So let me finish with the chores and get down the Boucherie.  Been nice chatting with you</UTT>Have a great day!</UTT>Same to you...
t_9344f2c0-4d14-48d1-9610-8c6237abe241</CONV>Good morning.  Are you a basketball fan?</UTT>No.  But I watch games with my daughter who loves basketball.</UTT>Did you know there are 30 teams in the NBA, 29 in the US and 1 in Canada.  I just heard that.  I didn't know until recently there was a Canadian team in the NBA.</UTT>No, I did not know that there was a Canadian team in the NBA.  Interesting to know.</UTT>I think I would watch more basketball if the players all shot granny style.  which is funny because it has been proven to be the best technique to score points.  Of course players wouldn't do that, because it looks so funny.</UTT>True.  They want to look professional.  I did not know that NBA is a men's professional league.  I thought it was often to female teams too.</UTT>Yeah, I think they have their own league.  Basketball players are some the highest paid people in the country even among athletes.</UTT>Wow, I did not know that.  I thought football players were the highest paid people.</UTT>Even the basketball coaches are higher paid as well.  The inventor of Basketball was actually a coach for University of Kansas</UTT>Was that James Naismith?</UTT>It was, and he is the only losing coach in the history of University of Kansas.  Ironic, don't you think?</UTT>I agree with you - it was ironic. Do you know that In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach?</UTT>Oh, you are right.  I thought it was the players.  I guess I can see why people would aspire to coach basketball.  I imagine you have to know a lot about the game though.</UTT>I wonder if you had to be a former player in order to become a coach.</UTT>I feel like it would help.  I don't know all the rules myself.  I know that there are 2 teams with 5 players on the court for each team.</UTT>Do you know that the supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor?</UTT>Wow, they must really like to play basketball.</UTT>I never heard any of the supreme court judges play basketballs.</UTT>Maybe they really like to pretend they are a basketball player like Kareem Abdul-Jabar.  Did you know he dunked so often, he got the shot banned from college Bball for a short time.</UTT>I heard about it?  Do you know the reason for it being banned?</UTT>I guess because he used it so much and he was so good at it.  It's not the only think banned in Basketball.  The NBA banned air jordans when they were first released.  That seems silly.</UTT>That was silly.  Michael Jordan decided to wear them anyway because Nike would be glad to pay for the fines.</UTT>I suppose shoe sales are more important and probably pay more than having to pay those fines.</UTT>True.  Anyway, I've got to run.  Nice chatting with you.
t_26ed5a6d-d4a5-4edc-be7c-ae967408fcab</CONV>Hi, what is your favorite form of entertainment ?</UTT>Hello, I like to play video games such as nintendo what about you?</UTT>I really liked the Nintendo, even if it could only display 54 colors.</UTT>Yeah but its a classic, its a bad thing they dont make it anymore</UTT>Yeah they stopped making it in 2003, but there is still the NES classic that does a pretty good job at emulating it.</UTT>I think they should remake it, or at least a version of it</UTT>Would you like something more powerful ? 54 colors is not a lot, compared to what a newer console can do nowadays.</UTT>I do have something more powerful an Xbox One but still, classic games are great and it would be nice to have them as well, do you know who Bill Nye is?</UTT>Yeah, I saw him on TV when I was young, I think his show was called Bill Nye the Science Guy ?</UTT>Yeah the same one, so he actually got a lucky break because he looked like Steve Martin and actually won a contest</UTT>In must have been in the 70s, I don't think Steve Martin was popular enough  later to desserve a lookalike contest.</UTT>Yeah I think it was in the 70s they do have a really similar look, did you Reagan was also an actor?</UTT>Yeah, I saw a documentary about him, he was a famous actor, he did a lot of westerns. You never knew that ?</UTT>No I didnt, I just found out, it turns out he got rejected in a movie, the role was of President, they though he didnt have the presidential look, pretty ironic hugh</UTT>It was another era, before TV and the image took over, I think he would have had the role now where the look is more important than the brain.</UTT>Yeah I agree, so did you watch Wonder Woman?</UTT>No I did not, but I have heard it was quite popular, was it ?</UTT>It was, you know the main actress of the movie actually served in the Israely defense forces</UTT>And what is the story of the movie ? Is it any good ?</UTT>Its good, it has a good plot its based on WWI and its about how Wonder Woman came to be, its the highest grossing superhero origin movie so that can give you an idea of the quality of the movie</UTT>I think I will see it. Thanks for the conversation.

Google likes dogs too!</UTT>Hahaha.  yes,  definitely,  I know a few people who work there and they get to bring their dogs to work!!!!  I wish I could do that.</UTT>what, me too. I wouldn't get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?</UTT>I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog?</UTT>I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?</UTT>her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt.</UTT>aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat</UTT>lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!  Ive had a few dogs and its heartbreaking.  I even took like 5 years break in between getting another one because I didnt know if I was ready.  Im not a cat person at all,  they are cute.</UTT>ha i agree with that. In japan there are more pets that kids under 15, that is a lot of pets!</UTT>Oh wow.  I hope they aren't neglected in any way!</UTT>I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don't own pets but are their guardian</UTT>Yessssss!  I think they whole world should do that!  Did you know dogs can learn over a thousand words!</UTT>I did not know that! I know that only dogs and elephants respond to pointing, out of thousands of animals</UTT>Also,  if you actually can stop countries from eating dog,  South Korea actually sells dog meat in their street markets!  I saw it when I visited there =( it was horrifying.  Yes,  I did know that elephants and dogs are so smart.</UTT>that is so sad and so wrong. I think I remember there was a US person at the olympics that took dogs to save from being killed, it made me feel happy</UTT>Thats amazing!  Did you know dogs have " eureka" moments where they feel happy solving a problem to get a reward?</UTT>What can't dogs do! I know they aren't color blind like we were taught when young. It was so nice chatting with you, tell yuki hi!</UTT>Lol Same to Rocky!  Have a good one.</UTT>will do! bye!

I have an iphone.</UTT>I have an android, samsung. Did you ever use a rotary phone?</UTT>I did. It was a pain. What about you?</UTT>Yeah a pain indeed but sometimes fun.</UTT>NYC's area code is 212 because of the ease of dialing on the rotary phone.</UTT>It makes perfect sense. Did you know it is impossible to separate two phone books?</UTT>I did not. I wonder how that works? I know an iPhone has a lot of computing power.</UTT>yeah it does, more than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent</UTT>That's crazy that intercontinental ballistic missles are being controlled by something less than an iphone.</UTT>there you go, the phones are so advanced now it is crazy</UTT>Do you like harry potter.</UTT>I do, how about you? have you seen all the movies?</UTT>I have, and read all the books. He was born on 7-31-80.</UTT>Nice, good for you. I guess the series then takes place through the 90s</UTT>Yeah. It was the most banned book for the 21st century.</UTT>SO crazy, I do not see the point. THe writer was turned down by 12 publishers and told to get a job</UTT>Wow. A tribute to persistance! Good for JK!</UTT>Yes good for her. Nice chatting with you
t_88620b9d-33d7-4dd4-aac6-c67ac0575b62</CONV>I think top athletes like Tom Brady need to be protective of their training methods so they can keep their competitive advantage.</UTT>Yes Tom Brady has shocked us all with his training</UTT>How much of his success do you think is training versus talent?</UTT>I think its about 70/30 talent. There is no way he would keep this up with bad conditioning.</UTT>So, 70 talent?  Regardless, I get the sense that you've got to be at 100% on both sides to play in the NFL for long, and more so to set records and win championships.</UTT>Yes but without training he would be done, talent or not. That's why it's 30 percent training.</UTT>Do you think training is mostly about food, exercise, or mental strength?</UTT>All of the above they all play just about equal parts.</UTT>Why do you think Tom Brady is always listed as injured each week?</UTT>I have no clue because he hits the field.</UTT>I don't trust Belichick.  It's weird stuff like the injury report that makes me question the whole team.</UTT>I am with you on that its getting shaky in their organization.</UTT>This year they really underperformed.  As a browns fan, it feels like Cleveland has more energy, though the Pats are in the playoffs.</UTT>I like the Browns but Pats are still a great team</UTT>Do you think Brady is the best ever?</UTT>Yes for sure</UTT>How much do you think he cares about being the best ever?  At some point, money is no object for him.</UTT>I think thats all he cares about ultimately and when he feels like his play has declined to the point where it is not effective he will hang it up</UTT>Will he go for seven rings?  He's already got the most of anyone.</UTT>I think he may try but it's up in the air whether he will pull it off</UTT>Time will tell.  I hope the team doesn't try any more shenanigans that are just distractions.

One of the highest paid celebrities.</UTT>oh definitely, she is second only to lebron James for highest paid celebrity apparently</UTT>Interesting about Robin Williams with performing voices in animated films.</UTT>oh for sure, he started the original trend of celebs performing in animated films</UTT>I love Disney, its interesting about Pixar secret room.</UTT>ya I wonder whats inside, did you ever watch sesame street?</UTT>Yes, I watch growing up. Do you like Carol Burnett?</UTT>I don't know what else she's in but I do know she was the first celeb to appear on Sesame street though</UTT>Oh really she had a popular comedy series in the 70's. Very funny.!</UTT>ok I'll have to chekc it out, did you hear about that famous ethiopian celebrity tv chef?</UTT>Yes, hunger problems with eating more diverse foods.  So important.</UTT>yup I agree, do you follow the bible at all?</UTT>Yes, interesting about the tower of babel.</UTT>yup, interesting it was based on a real building, and that building still exists in iraq</UTT>Did you know about Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy are the only two who did not use the bible at swearing in ceremonies?</UTT>no that is crazy, and even Jefferson cut out parts of the bible to create his own version of it

Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?</UTT>That is amazing. Even the ramones who toured for 20 years only played like 100 per year</UTT>Yea that's pretty amazing. I love Linkin Park.</UTT>Also that is almost one every day. Must have been incredibly taxing</UTT>I bet. In Croatia there is an ancient amphitheater that is still in use as a venue today.</UTT>Isn't there also one in pompeii? I believe pink floyd performed there</UTT>Yes, I've seen the Pink Floyd performance in Pompeii.</UTT>Do you mean the recording? I believe that had no audience on site</UTT>Yes, I saw the recording of it.</UTT>Did you like it?</UTT>Yea it was pretty good. Do you like poetry?</UTT>I enjoy my fair share. There are many different types of poetry though</UTT>Yes there is a lot. There is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards, is inspiring.</UTT>That in itself is inspiring. Much like saying there is two sides to every story</UTT>Yep. The Japanese alphabet, when recited in order, forms a poem.</UTT>Are you familiar with palindromes?</UTT>I am not. Do you know a lot about them?</UTT>Palindromes are a series of words that are the same read forward or backwards. Understanding that, you must understand how hard it must have been for Demetri Martin to write a 224 word palindrome poem.</UTT>Oh wow ok. I bet that was a challenge then!</UTT>Indeed! In any case, thanks for chatting.

It is the most popular one right now it seems</UTT>Yeah considering in the morning 33% of the bandwidth is taken up by them in NA</UTT>Yeah pretty crazy.

Too bad they passed on buying netflix when they could</UTT>Exactly, could have spent $50 million and make billions now</UTT>Not a very smart business decisoon, bet they are kicking themselves about it</UTT>Yup. WIth youtube they make half of the peak internet usage in NA</UTT>That is crazy. And they spend 20 times more on postage still than on the bandwidth</UTT>One wonders, what are they shipping now that all is digital?</UTT>Exactly. Do you like the Lego company?</UTT>Yeah they are pretty cool. Their bricks are really consistent it seems , only 18 out of 1 million are defective</UTT>that makes for great quality and in turn for awesome business</UTT>pretty much. If all lego bricks available were shared among people everyone would get 86</UTT>Nice. A german artist once painted a bridge to make it look like it was made of lego</UTT>Neat. If workers word at their company for 25 years they would get a 14 karat gold lego</UTT>yeah and it was worth a lot, $15 000</UTT>That us a sweet bonus, but then again t is also dedication</UTT>Yeah agree with you there.

There is a type of swimming where the swimmer has their hands and legs bound and swim like a dolphin.\</UTT>That sounds equal parts cool and dangerous.</UTT>I agree. All Cornell students must pass a basic swimming test before they are allowed to graduate.</UTT>I am surprised more Florida schools don't have that standard.  The US is pretty strong in swimming, they have more gold medals than the rest of the world combined.</UTT>That's really good. Native Americans introduced the front crawl swimming stroke.</UTT>I heard it was to beat the British who only used the Breast Stroke</UTT>I heard that too. There is a banned swimsuit that is so good that 94% of all swimming races were won with it.</UTT>That was back in the 2008 Olympics wasnt it.  They were so fast that year!</UTT>Yep, that was back in 2008. Do you like basketball?</UTT>I watch some, I am excited for the NCAA tournament, you?</UTT>Me too. I love college basketball and March Madness.</UTT>Abdul-Jabbar was so good at the dunk he got it banned from college hoops.</UTT>That's interesting that they banned the dunk. Naismith who was the inventor of basketball was the only losing coach in Kansas's history.</UTT>I cant believe he could lose at the game he created.</UTT>I know...so sad. In 39 of 50 states, the top paying employee in the state is either a college basketball or football coach.</UTT>Looks like it is time for me to have a career change.  But on another note that is ridiculous.</UTT>HAHA. The New Zealand basketball team was nicknamed the Tall Blacks.</UTT>I am sure there is something behind that name, but in todays climate that sounds a bit racist.</UTT>I think so too. Well, it was great talking. Have a good day!
t_72df8d58-0370-42cf-aa26-f9c9e0d0fc2b</CONV>Hello, what type of books do you like to read?</UTT>I'm a big fan of science fiction, fantasy, and classics, but I'll read almost anything you put in front of me. Are you a fan of reading too?</UTT>I like auto biography and true crime mostly but if the writer is good, I will read fantasy, comedy and more! Did you know that William Shakespeare is considered the greatest writer in the English language?</UTT>I've read that he was so influential that many colloquialisms and turns of phrase we use today were popularized by his works.</UTT>Yes, did you also know that he invented the names, Jessica, Miranda and Olivia? I never knew that!</UTT>I had no idea! I've read a few of his plays, but I'd love to see them acted out. Apparently a few theater companies, Faction of Fools and WSC Avant Bard, are planning on doing a few.</UTT>That would be great to see them, I agree. I like plays, but haven't been to see one in about 15 years.</UTT>Do you have a specific one you'd like to see? One company is putting on Henry V, but I haven't read that play yet.</UTT>I'm a romantic at heart so I believe it would have to be Romeo & Juliet, I've never seen it. We have a wonderful little playhouse in my town, I wonder if they've ever done it, I will have to check it out.</UTT>Romeo & Juliet is a great one to see. I love the original most, but the movie that was set in contemporary times is also good. WSC Avant Bard is doing something similar with a modern version of Shakespeare's Illyria.</UTT>I see that Shakespeare was only 52 years old when he died in 1616. Do you know what he died from?</UTT>I don't, but I think lifespans back then weren't as long as they are now. It's amazing how much he wrote in that time though - 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two longer poems, and more.</UTT>True, I always heard that he died on his actual birthday. He did a lot in his life, true and lifespans were shorter then too.</UTT>I always thought it was funny that he married someone named Anne Hathaway. It was interesting to learn that after seeing films with the actress Anne Hathaway.</UTT>Yes, I was thinking that same thing, it is also interesting that Shakespeare and Pocahontas were alive during the same time period, that's neat.</UTT>They definitely aren't two people I imagine in the same time period, and one ended up writing so many stories while the other inspired a lot of them, like the Pocahontas movies.</UTT>It's also neat that Shakespeare is the one that coined the phrase," Wild Goose Chase" and the phrase "Good riddance", who would have thought that!</UTT>He really had a clever way with words. I wish I could hear some of his writings in the original accents to better understand the puns and rhymes from those days.</UTT>True, that would be interesting.  They say that there wasn't much record keeping that was found when he passed away.</UTT>Oh.</UTT>I see that polish composer Andre Tchaikowsky donated his own skull to the Shakespeare company, hoping that it would be used as a prop in the Skull of Yorick, and it was!</UTT>I think it's fantastically creepy that they use a real skull as a prop. I wonder what kind of props they'll be using in the Faction of Fools and WSC Avant Bard events!</UTT>Wow, true!
t_3e2841cc-5768-4d38-95f2-0d7b4fda24e9</CONV>Hello there, do you play many video games?</UTT>I do.  I like playing Pub G.  Did you know that video games were called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military?</UTT>No I have never heard that.  What type of game is Pub G?  Is it similar to Fortnite?</UTT>Yes just like Fortnite.  It's the same idea.  Kids love to play Fortnite.  It's good that kids under the age of 16 in south korea aren't allowed play video games past midnight.</UTT>Yeah kids are all about it, and all about watching others play games on YouTube.  And I think that is good as well.</UTT>Have you heard of Stephen Fry's narration for little big planet and harry potter video games?  I think he was a good match for these games.</UTT>No, but I would like to check it out.  Did you know that Tom Hanks brother, Jim, does Woody's voice in video games?</UTT>No I had no idea.  Tom might have given that gig to his brother because he was too busy.  I am sure there are many jobs available in the video game industry.  As of 2015, video games have generated over 74 billion dollar a year!</UTT>Yeah I wonder if I could get a job doing voices or something, and wow that is a crazy amount of money!</UTT>I know my voice wouldn't cut it.  I am a bit monotoned.  I wonder how much the Asian markets are making they are force to reckon with when it comes to mobile games.</UTT>Yeah they certainly are.  Did you know that a game designer calculated that as a whole planet we play 3 billion hours of video games in a single week!?</UTT>I believe it because my husband can spend hours playing video games.</UTT>Yeah I need to purchase a system so I can play FiFa, I haven't since I bought a new house.  I do have a Nintendo that never gets used.</UTT>I love playing FIFA too.  Another one of past times are riding horses.  Did you know that Icelandic horses have a fifth speed that is speed walking for a horse.</UTT>I think I have heard that before, I think its called tolt or something like that.</UTT>You are smart that is correct.  Well can you guess why Dalmatians are associated with firefighters?</UTT>I think they were originally brought around because they were thought to calm the horses.</UTT>Yes that is correct!  I had to give up riding horses because just like Clint Eastwood, we have a mid life allergy to horses.</UTT>That sucks, I hate allergies, I have allergies to a lot of things like dogs but I still really like them and will live with them.  Thats too bad you had to give that up though, I think riding horses is such a cool activity.</UTT>Yes I love horse and I am always watching videos on horses.  I mean there are so many of them.  There are over 300 breeds of horses in the world.</UTT>Wow that is a ton of breeds.  Well it was nice talking with you, I hope you have a good one.
t_38aafc06-7e95-4a93-9e6f-fdbe62b53716</CONV>hi, do you like cars?</UTT>I do like cars. I love the convenience of using them for transportation. Do you like cars as well?</UTT>yeah for sure. do you know how cadillac got its name?</UTT>I actually do. It was named after the guy that founded Detroit. There are actually a lot of cars named after people, like Mercedez-Benz. Do you know why we actually call them cars?</UTT>I am not sure about that but I know car trunks got their name after the wooden trunks old card had</UTT>Yeah. That makes sense. I get why we call the automobiles - a machine that moves on its own power. I just don't get why we call them cars. It is odd to see how different cars can be in different parts of the world.</UTT>that is very true. do you like music?</UTT>Yes. I like different music depending on my mood. I generally stick to fairly bland/background music when I just want to break the silence.</UTT>Nice, good for you. do you ever listen to rap?</UTT>I don't. I know a little about it but I don't. I wonder about the message behind it, more the poetry.</UTT>yeah. tupac's music is in the library of congress</UTT>I heard that. I can't think of any of his songs, but I do know of him. Rap is certainly a valuable method of expression. Do you listen to rap? Do you have a favorite artist?</UTT>I like eminem a bit. do you like him?</UTT>I think the only song I know of his is Slim Shady, thanks to TRL back in the days. I do know that he wanted to be a comic book writer before he became a rapper. I wonder if he still likes to draw.</UTT>I bet he does and I mean, he could try it if he wanted</UTT>I am sure. It is great to be able to do what you like for a living and indulge your hobbies as well. I think I spend too much time on Facebook to really get into my hobbies. Do you find yourself wasting time on Facebook?</UTT>From time to time, but I am trying to lessen my time in there. do you know why it is blue.</UTT>I do. Zuckerberg is colorblind. If I were going to create something like Facebook, I would certainly want to make it look good to me.</UTT>yeah that totally makes sense. did you know the like button is illegal in parts of germany?</UTT>I did know that but I don't know why. Do you?</UTT>No idea really. nice chat
t_50be36d7-7df3-47e3-acff-aeff04065dea</CONV>Hello!  Do you know much about the history of clothing?</UTT>I know quite a bit, actually. I know there was a man who wrote 70 different items of clothing in a Chinese airport just to avoid the bagging charge. Ha! What about you?</UTT>Wow!  lol  I know that Apple had a clothing like in 1986.</UTT>Did they really? That seems unusual for them! Did you know there's a bulletproof clothing mogul named Miguel Cabarello who tests the clothes by shooting the employees to enforce quality control on his wares? That is scary to me!</UTT>Whoa!  I don't think I would want to be one of the employees.  Hope that had a good quality control team!  lol  I was surprised to find out that Pilgrims clothing was full of color.  I'm so used to them being portrayed wearing black and white.</UTT>Same here. It seems like everything you see pilgrims in, they're always wearing black/white. What I find funny is people actually used to do their laundry in old faithful. They'd stick their clothes in the geyser and when it erupted, it would spit their clothes out clean. That's hilarious. Ha!</UTT>Hahahahaha I can picture them shooting up into the air.  Funny stuff!  Something on another funny note...the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana!</UTT>Ha! You're kidding me? That's embarrassing. Speaking of presidents, isn't it surprising Woodrow Wilson was the only US president ever to have a PhD?</UTT>Yes!  I never knew that.  The top 3 wealthiest presidents in American history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.</UTT>Wow! Now that is a surprise. Just like when I found out that FDR was the last US president that fluently spoke a foreign language. I just always assumed they all spoke different languages.</UTT>Interesting!  The president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office.  Must have had a lot of free time on his hands.</UTT>Ha! No kidding. I wonder if he won the popular vote unlike 5 different presidents here in the US who were still elected despite losing the popular vote. One even lost by 10%!</UTT>I'm not sure!  He obviously didn't work on his politics 100 percent of the time.  lol  Speaking of US presidential elections....did you know that up until 1805 the runner up automatically became the vice president?</UTT>Really? That sounds like a mistake. There would be chaos if they did that today. Ha! On a related note, Guatemala doesn't legally allow close relatives of former presidents to run for President. Perhaps America should look into doing that as well! Ha!</UTT>That would be a real mess if that was today.  I could see Hillary and Trump brawling.  That's a good law Guatemala has!  That should be passed down to corporate run companies as well!  Do you use Facebook?</UTT>I do use it a lot, actually. What about you? It's hard to believe Facebook has more users than there were people in the world 200 years ago, isn't it?</UTT>I'm not thrilled by it.  But I do use it to stay in touch with people.  Burger King had a promotion where if you unfriended 10 people on Facebook you would get a free whopper.  I would have done that in a heartbeat.</UTT>Same here. Without a doubt. Ha! I think it's kind of scary that 30% of the adult population in the US uses Facebook for their primary source of news. I can't trust half the stuff I read on there and don't see how anyone else does!</UTT>No way!  I buzz right by that garbage.  Did you know that Facebook is primarily blue because Mark Zuckerburg suffers from red-green colorblindness?</UTT>I wasn't aware of that but it makes sense. You know another crazy fact is back in 2011, a third of all divorce filings in America actually contained the word Facebook. That is sad, really!</UTT>That doesn't surprise me at all.  Sad reflection of where society is now.  I've known quite a few people I've worked with who got themselves into trouble by getting involved with members of the opposite sex from Facebook.  It's a shame.  I have to get going.  It's been nice chatting with you!
t_2bc0fec9-70e1-469a-b46c-569dbbc85454</CONV>do you like fish?</UTT>I do, tasty animals, do you?</UTT>fish is practically a vegetable. they are the food that my food eats.</UTT>Yeah except for fish like the black swallower fish, I hear that one likes to bite</UTT>I envy that fish's ability to eat. that is a glorious spectacle. I would go to the buffet everyday.</UTT>Buffet is my favorite kind of restaurant so yea, did you hear about that breed of jellyfish, the one that is immortal!</UTT>i did not. i wonder what it does all day with its unending life. must get kinda boring. who does it talk to? what celebrities does it follow?</UTT>I agree, must be a really boring life, still, interesting species might be worthwhile to study them</UTT>true. they might hold the secret to immortality for us. that would indeed be a long boring life for most people.</UTT>I think death is a necessary part of life so yeah, there is also a breed of zebrafish that has 84% of the counter genes that cause disease on humans</UTT>the zebra fish could also hold some secrets about how to prevent and cure disease. maybe our fishy friends could be a great benefit to us.</UTT>We should really study them also the seahorse is the only fish with a neck</UTT>that is a unique problem too. hard for the seahorse to find a chiropractor. who is your favorite celebrity?</UTT>One of my favorite celebrities was Robin Williams, the voice of Aladdin so sad how things ended for him</UTT>he was very sick and very sad. i wish they had a treatment for his disease. he was an inspiration.</UTT>He was an inspiration, I agree, depression is a silent killer,</UTT>he had a kind of dementia. very serious, untreatable. I wonder if he ever got to see the secret room at Pixar.</UTT>I think he did, he was a really influential celebrity so yeah, maybe Judge Judy did too, she is the highest paid celebrity if you don't take LeBron into the mix</UTT>she is a star. her show has been around for a long time. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>It has been around for a long time, earning $120,000 per episode is insane,</UTT>i bet the advertisers are happy to pay. Have a good day!</UTT>I bet that too, she is the second highest paid celebrity for a reason, have a good one.
t_ae822aef-ab98-4a11-9a44-f05145e28309</CONV>Hello,  did you know that the sun is actually white?</UTT>I did not know that. That's one more thing it has in common with Jeff Bezos.</UTT>lol right. I feel like our elementary teachers should have mentioned this at some point,  kinda feel dumb for drawing all those yellow suns.</UTT>Better than a yellow jeff bezos. I drew ligthening bolts red. i wonder if thats accurate</UTT>lol I do not know.  I hear the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy!  That is crazy!</UTT>It produces enough energy in 1 sec to meet our energy needs for 500K years. Some one lean to harvest this thing!</UTT>I know right,  solar panels arent enough!</UTT>you'd think bezos would take some time out of building clocks into mountains to figure this sun energy thing out.</UTT>I wonder what the significance is of putting it into a mountain lol I like that amazon has a contract with the post office to deliver on sundays.</UTT>judging from recent news, the amazon postman definitely rings twice. Bezos must feel as hot as a lightening bolt</UTT>I didnt know amazon owns IMDB, I use that all the time to look up movie info.</UTT>First books, now movies. They are controlling everything. There's sort of a 18th century-like moral panic about them.</UTT>Amazon is amazing.  I use a lot of their services.  Did you  know that amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 miles every day?</UTT>wow. but yeah...software, tvs, furniture, food, etc...they gotta cover a lot of ground.</UTT>I love their service audible too,  its so convenient since I drive a lot.</UTT>kindle is great. One cna read a lot faster. not speed reading fast like anne jones' 4700 words/min, but fast nonetheless</UTT>Thats is unbelievable,  that is way too many words lol</UTT>yeah, one wonders if you can keep a sense of creativity and critical analysis reading that fast</UTT>Yeah,  it doesnt seem like you can actually understand or process what the reading material is about.</UTT>yeah, you're like a lightening bolt, you may be 5x faster  but then you are gone</UTT>lol its been good talking to you.
t_7d679eb5-f7dd-4885-88d7-10ed46ccf15c</CONV>Hello. Did you know there is a violin made of stone, and it is actually playable?</UTT>Never heard of that. Wonder if it has 4 strings, like normal violins?</UTT>I would imagine so. Larry (three stooges fame) also played, I guess he was very good.</UTT>Heard he burned an arm as a child, and violion lessons helped strengthen damaged nerves. Was he good?</UTT>If WWI hadn't happened, I guess we would have found out, as he was headed to a music school</UTT>I see. Same era: Einstein, already a famous physicist, also played violin exceptionally well.</UTT>My daughter has a poster of him above her bed, with the quote "The Greatest Scientists Are Artists As Well". She says its inspiration for both her art and music.</UTT>That's great. Have you ever read or seen the film based on the 1902 A.E.W. Mason book, "The Four Feathers"?</UTT>I have not. Is it the one that the judge tried to ban, due to featuring a black character?</UTT>Good question. I don't know, but since much of the story is based in the Middle East during 1880's conflicts there, some Arab characters are featured. Could they have been called "moors" - or black?</UTT>I'm not sure, as I've never read it. I'm more of a sci-fi fan, and love that Poe had a cyborg in one of his stories.</UTT>Edgar Allen, yes. Still re-read his "Cask of Amontilliado" story and the poem, "The Raven". Ahead of his time, that writer!</UTT>Have you checked out the wiki that ranks all of the fictional characters according to their powers and abilities?</UTT>No, but interesting feature. Did you know that powerful ruler (for real), Julius Caesar even wrote fiction?</UTT>I heard something about him writing about hercules. Have you read it?</UTT>Not Caesar's fan fiction. Hercules and Oedipus are main heroes in Greek epics; Caesar would have known about them.</UTT>I haven't read much of that, I mainly read travel guides, as I travel a lot. I'm hoping to get to Macinac Island this summer, and bike around the island.</UTT>Understand that it is a lovely, slow-paced place. Try a horse-drawn carriage there! Have you, like Caesar, ever been to Greece, through Italy, to Germany or England - or elsewhere in Europe?</UTT>I have been to Iceland, it's expensive as I had to travel by plane between towns.</UTT>My son had a stop in Iceland on route to Australia. Wants to go back for a real visit. Understand they have no public rail service there. Too many volcanos and other impassable terrain??</UTT>It's a rough terrain, I would love to go back, and am trying to find a cheap flight to Japan (on Iceland Air) for a layover. Japans highways are toll, so it's expensive to travel there.</UTT>Yes, Americans would not accept tolls on all our highways, like the Japanese do. Heard to go across Japan you can expect to pay $300 or more...ouch!</UTT>It is very expensive. Thanks for chatting with me, have a wonderful day.
t_c7261f17-4cdb-4bd0-ab9a-ad68b475e38f</CONV>Are you a fan of horror films?</UTT>I am a definite no on that!</UTT>I'm not either to be honest. What about Fantasy films, do you watch them?</UTT>I'll take back a bit. I like Edgar Allen Poe. I know watching horror movies can burn up to 180 calories!</UTT>Interesting. So instead of going to the gym, you just sit there and watch the movies?</UTT>Right! Did you know Bambi terrified Stephen King.</UTT>I'm not surprised, Bambi does die in the end.</UTT>I'm glad. I know if you watch a horror movie before you view abstract art you will enjoy the art more.</UTT>Interesting, any type of specific artists, or just abstract art?</UTT>I think just abstract art.</UTT>Ok, I wonder why that is. Any ideas as to why this occurs?</UTT>None at all. It's hard to believe Danny the boy from the shining did not know he was acting in horror film.</UTT>Interesting. I didn't know that. Did you know that they have fantasy draft spelling bees?</UTT>No, I did not. A single fold in the brain makes the difference between perceiving reality and fantasy.</UTT>Interesting, I didn't realize that. Have you heard of the fantasy called "In the Realms of the Unreal?"</UTT>No, what is it about?</UTT>It's apparently a fantasy, but I'm not sure what it is about.</UTT>Oh, okay. I know fantasy has evolved into various media including film, TV, graphic novels and more!</UTT>Wow! That is really cool. What about Thor, have you seen it?</UTT>I have heard of Thor. I know it is a 2011 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics character of the same name.</UTT>Yeah, it is pretty good. I saw the first one and kind of liked it.

Another interesting thing is the prime minister in Japan sends a silver cup to you when you turn 100 in Japan! But the so many 100 year olds in Japan that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups.</UTT>Yeah, I heard that. They must be running low on silver too! HA!</UTT>Haha. In 95 a radio station made a successful prank call to Queen Elizabeth by pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Wonder if they got in trouble!</UTT>They probably did. Do you know what radio station it was?</UTT>No, I am not sure about that. Have you head of Chief Mouser?</UTT>No, who is that?</UTT>That is the cat who resides at the residence of the prime minister of the UK.</UTT>Interesting. Did you know you can hear Jupiter Radio storms on AM radio here?</UTT>Interesting! I wonder if that's easy to pick up on the radio. I know what doesn't sound easy to me, making a fox hole radio.</UTT>Yeah, it probably sounds pretty weird. It would be interstellar radio!</UTT>Soldiers in WWI made foxhole radios with a razorblade and a pencil. Have you made a foxhole radio before?</UTT>Yeah, I think it was in that movie Hart's War with Bruce Willis.</UTT>Do you listen to news on the radio? A Finnish radio station has a weekly news program in classical Latin. I wonder how many people can understand it.</UTT>No, I don't. But that is because I don't drive to work. I don't speak latin either!</UTT>I thought it was a dead language!</UTT>It is. In economics they use it a lot as well. It's annoying.</UTT>Ha, interesting. In Canada, all radios are required to play at least 40% Canadian music.</UTT>Yeah, it must be horrific. Anyways, nice chatting with you.

Nintendo had only 54 colors.</UTT>For sure, think about how good we thought the graphics were back then. They just stopped making them in japan in 2003</UTT>Wow that's a long run for Mario, haha! Did you know that Ronald Reagan was turn down for movie role because they said he wasn't presidential enough.</UTT>That is too funny! If only they could tell the future lol. Do you know julius caesar?</UTT>I do, he's an interesting character.</UTT>Apparently he went to Britain and saw chickens being used as entertainment and was mind blown</UTT>Um i like my chicken fried with hot sauce, that about as entertaining as it gets. Have you seen or read starship trooper?</UTT>lol me too! I have not read it but have seen the movie, you?</UTT>Yeah but i think i blocked it out, lol! Apparently it's required reading for 3 out of 5 of our military branches. They must know something i do not.</UTT>wow, I should check it out.

I just wish my grandfather had saved baseball cards - one lucky man found 3 million dollars worth of them in his grandfather's attic</UTT>3 million dolars no kidding! that is awesome, what a lucky break he had,</UTT>For sure.  Wonder if baseball cards exist in Japan?  The game is really popular there as well</UTT>I bet they due, they really love the sport our there, do you have a favorite baseball team?  I like the Yankees</UTT>I am an Atlanta Braves fan but I could not help but love the Cubs when they finally won the World Series a few years ago</UTT>Yeah I bet they were really exited, they could lift that curse finally</UTT>Yes they won back to back world series and then never won again for years</UTT>Babe Ruth was caught stealing a base and then his team lost back in the year 1926</UTT>Yeah talk about blowing the world series for your team - in game 7 even!</UTT>I know right, he still was considered a legend, things could have turn out differently if he didnt had the guts to steal that base</UTT>Yes.  baseball is not as popular as it once was though - the womens world cup had higher tv ratings than the world series</UTT>It did? Wow, that is suprising, womans sports usually dont get support at all</UTT>yes as little as foreign sports!  During the 92 series the us marines carried the canada flag into the stadium upside down!</UTT>I wonder why, do you know the reason for that?</UTT>An accident I think!  They were clueless.  I hate the Yankees because they win so much.  Do you like them?</UTT>I like them yeah lol, did you know theres a Lost Yankees player!!</UTT>How did they lose him?

LGBTQ people say it matters to them</UTT>The onion says that ernie and bert are pansexual perverts. i wonder who to believe these days. CTW says they are just puppets.</UTT>The Onion is a satirical news website.  I personally dont care either way.</UTT>i guess for LGBTQIA it is representation that matter. the lessons taught to children about tolerance and awareness are important. i think it might be better to create a new character for that.</UTT>Very true.  They created an autistic character to teach about those differences.  Sometimes adults need to learn those lessons too.</UTT>yes adults are always worried that something is going to screw up the kids. if the character is not just right, then the kids will go ape. i think that the kids will do just fine. i grew up with comic books and sesame street and i have never broken parole. LOL</UTT>That is the truth.  Plus with the internet these days everything is accessible.</UTT>i figure that the internet and rule 34 are a bigger threat than some character in S S. the universe is vast. the internet is even bigger.</UTT>We dont even know how expansive either is.  Kind of scary at some point that all that is out there and people chose to worry about what made up characters do.</UTT>people have too much time to worry. if we kept them busy, they would not have time to worry. what do you think of this universe of ours? it is huge.</UTT>It is.  I was listening to a podcast about it on the way to work this morning.  About the Fermi Complex.</UTT>the fermi complex? isnt fermi some sort of science guy? probably knew the secrets of the universe.</UTT>Yeah.  It has to do with the fact we might be alone in the universe, and what those ramifications are if that is true.</UTT>i think that we are not alone but the aliens really dont need to contact us. they have their own problems. plus the whole ernie and bert controversy bothers the aliens.</UTT>Who knows, that might be the reason they dont.  LOL</UTT>the universe keeps an eye on us and makes us feel like we're alone until we work out our issues. i figure we have a lot to do to prove our worth.</UTT>Its been good chatting have a great day!</UTT>You too! great chat! enjoy the universe! say hi to fermi for me!</UTT>Will do!
t_77710eb9-5cb0-4ba0-9713-c616882c3f07</CONV>hi, do you watch football?</UTT>I do, my team is in the AFC, what about yours?</UTT>I do not have a favorite team but just watch the games sometimes. did you know women can technically play?</UTT>I didnt know that I did know about the sexist rule the Saints have, it just makes me sick</UTT>Me too, I find the worst part to be the one when they might be mid meal and have to leave</UTT>Yeah thats really unfair, football is a beautiful game but that angers me, just like theres only 11 minutes of actual game play, all those ads make me angry</UTT>Yeah and we are glued to the tv for hours to and end and in the end it is 11 minutes</UTT>Yeah, I agree, NFL has tracking chips on their players</UTT>Yeah I guess that makes it more convenient for them to track their movement</UTT>Its unbelievable how tech affects sports, the football also has a chip and all kinds of cools stats are recovered from them</UTT>yeah. do you know who kellan moore is?</UTT>Yeah he used to be a QB in the Cowboys, now he runs the offensive plays, why do you ask?</UTT>he is also the only QB that is lefthanded</UTT>Interesting so no other lefties on the league!! I wonder why is that, do you know who Baker Mayfield is?</UTT>Actually I do not think I know him</UTT>Ok so he is a QB and he once considered quitting football and pursuing a career in the video game business..</UTT>Wow, well good that he stuck to football because it worked great for him</UTT>Yeah Im guessing it did, football players earn a lot of money so yeah,</UTT>Yeah, how about eli manning, do you know him?</UTT>Yeah his a great QB he has a genius level IQ so that's impressive.</UTT>That is so amazing. Nice chat :)
t_790cfc9a-eb2b-4c7c-a61a-50963b5db3d3</CONV>Did you know that Canada has two national sports: lacrosse and ice hockey?</UTT>No I didn't know that, why do you think Canada is so good at hockey though? Apparently they scored like 130 goals and only let in three goals in the entire first Olympic Winter Games back in 1924</UTT>Only a guess, but i would they had been playing longer than other countries.  I would not want to be a pro hockey player.  They lose up to 8 pounds in one game.</UTT>I wouldn't mind being a pro hockey player actually haha that would help me to lose some weight haha. One crazy thing is at a hockey rink can be swapped into a basketball court very easily just by swapping the floor out. In fact that's what most of them do</UTT>I heard a hockey player was one traded for a dollar.  Do you know who that was?</UTT>I don't know why you was traded for a dollar. But I do know that you went on to win for Stanley Cups haha. This was back in 1993 though</UTT>Do you like football?</UTT>I think football is ok. I did watch the Superbowl. What about you? There's a team that painted their opposing team's locker room pink which is funny</UTT>I heard about that, too funny,  I love football and the Pats are my favorite team.  Did you ESPN was the one who created the yellow first down line for TV?</UTT>That is pretty awesome that they invited it. Definitely useful for watching the games especially if you're not a big football fan. They even want an Emmy for doing that. Which I didn't think that's what you get an Emmy for but that's still cool. Did you hear about the Patriots player who's never had a fumble?</UTT>No, I didnt.  It certainly isn't Tom Brady who has fumbled during the last 2 Superbowls.  Is it Sony MIchael?</UTT>Nope it is benjarvus geen-ellis, he's a running back. I never would have thought that it would have been him but that does make some sense I guess. I would be so stressed too because every game could be the last game to ruin that perfect record haha</UTT>Yeah, I would until a game in which we were ahead by 5 touchdowns in the 4th quarter and then fumble on purpose so i wouldn't have to worry about it anymore</UTT>You're right about that. Have you ever seen the movie Frozen? Or do you like Disney movies in general?</UTT>No, I haven't seen Frozen.  I am not really into Disney movies.  Was it good?</UTT>Frozen is ok. I really like the old Disney movies like Sleeping Beauty and I even like the 90s stuff like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. What movie I kind of like is The Lion King and that was actually dubbed into Zulu which is interesting</UTT>Did you know Wreck-It_Ralph took almost 30 years to develop?</UTT>Wow I didn't know that. Have you actually seen that movie? I didn't think it was that amazing myself. One thing that doesn't surprise me is that the toy industry talks to Disney before the film was even made. That makes a lot of sense in terms of selling toys haha</UTT>I went to see it with the wife.  She wanted to see it.  I thought it was okay.  Oh yeah, Disney knows what it is doing when it comes to selling toys!</UTT>Oh for sure! I remember in the 90s you couldn't go to McDonald's without getting a bunch of Disney toys there haha. I also know that Disney recycles their animation frames, I've seen that in movies like the Disney Robin Hood movie, they stole scenes from Sleeping Beauty in that one</UTT>Wow! i did not know they recycled their animation frames.  Makes sense though, why create something new when you can just reuse something</UTT>Yep exactly. It's all about saving time and money I guess. It's interesting that Disney's most successful franchise is the Pirates of the Caribbean series, it's earned over 1 billion dollars including the totals for all of the sequels
t_d986ab28-3e88-43f8-8928-30237f2885c3</CONV>do you like basketball?</UTT>I love it.Do you know who Kareem Jabbar is?</UTT>Yes the guy that used the dunk shot so much that it got banned for a while</UTT>Yeah. Do you know who invented the game?</UTT>Yes that was James Naismith who was a coach at the U of Kansas</UTT>Yes and he was also the only losing coach there</UTT>Yeah pretty ironic. Did you know coaches are really well paid?</UTT>Yes in 39 our of 50 states in the US they are the highest paid employees</UTT>Yes. Do you know where the highest court in the land is?</UTT>yes that is on the top floor of the US Supreme Court</UTT>Yes. DO you know what the NZ basketball team is nicknamed?</UTT>Yes the tall blacks. Do you know how many teams are in the NBA?</UTT>Yes there are 30 teams and only one of them is Canadian</UTT>Yeah. Did you know Reggie Miller was never able to get out of the shadow of his sister?</UTT>Yes she was a star, scored 105 points once and broke 8 national records</UTT>Yeah. Did you hear what deal Iverson signed with Rebook back in 2001?</UTT>Yes he is making $800 000 per year until he is 55</UTT>Yes and then he gets a sum of $32 million</UTT>Yes he is good for life. Nice chatting with you</UTT>Yes same here, keep on eye on those games</UTT>Will do, have a good one
t_0c041593-d042-46c0-9fa5-41c663ed0a89</CONV>Did you know that the White House has two twin buildings in Ireland and France?</UTT>No, I hadn't heard that but I did know that the guest house is bigger than the white house.</UTT>Yeah seems like it, but even with his guest house being larger than the White House, Trump is still not in the top 3 wealthiest presidents in American history.</UTT>True. Speaking of France did you know that a man in France was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice by impersonating a government official?</UTT>I did not know that! that must be a hard thing to accompish, I mean who would fall for that!</UTT>It does seem pretty incredible!  It's just as incredible as hearing that the White House still uses floppy disks!</UTT>Yeah with all tech available, but maybe they still used them for safety reasons, they might be harder to hack as they require a manual access. Did you know Teddy Roosevelt banned Christmas trees from the White House?</UTT>I didn't know that! I wonder why he did that!</UTT>It seems like he was a staunch conservationist.</UTT>Wow!  Well conservatives are not all bad. I mean, George W. Bush put solars panels on the White House!</UTT>Thats interesting, I had no idea he did that, its a good thing to be remembered as a president that started with clean energy for the White House.</UTT>I totally agree with that.  It's much better than being remembered as being called President Banana as the first president of Zimbabwe was.</UTT>Yeah I wouldnt like to be remembered by a nickname like that one, did you know that until 1805 the runner up of a presidential election became the vice president?</UTT>No I didn't know that but it is a really good idea!</UTT>I can see it working, I wonder why it got changed.</UTT>I don't know.  Our government is odd and secretive. I mean, did you know that they own 86% of the land in Nevada?</UTT>Thats a lot of land I didnt know that but I agree, all thoose secrets, I wonder what else they are hiding as they had plans to destroy Wikileaks.</UTT>It does make you wonder.  I mean, they passed a law protecting them from violating the geneva convention back in 2006.</UTT>Thats crazy, it seems like we are just puppets in their game and since Trump I think things are getting worse.</UTT>At least one government on the planet is good.  Norway donated one billion dollars to help save the Amazon Rainforest.</UTT>Yeah not everything is lost, hopefully that goverment doesnt have dark secrets as well.
t_161eac7a-5abc-42c5-b67b-0f8bd3d9a2bf</CONV>Do you use the internet frequently?</UTT>I do every day!  Do you remember the Honey Badger videos from 2011?</UTT>What was that?</UTT>It was a viral video were a man narrated over a national geographic video.  Honey Badger dont care.  Came from that.  It was pretty great.</UTT>Sounds pretty hilarious</UTT>It wade the guy pretty famous.  There were even lawsuits bout the phrase.</UTT>Lawsuits? Why?</UTT>People used the phrase on clothing, greeting cards, and I guess they guy thought it violated his rights and that it was his phrase.</UTT>So what happened in the end?</UTT>I believe he lost in the US district court.   It circulated around youtube for a long time.</UTT>You mean the plaintiff or defendant?</UTT>The defendant lost, the guy who made the video.</UTT>Ah thanks for clarifying. That is a shame</UTT>It is amazing how youtube videos have evolved.  The first video uploaded was a guy talking about an elephant.</UTT>Now they are the 2nd largest search engine on the net</UTT>Youtube actually began as a dating website.  I didnt realize that.</UTT>Really? I personally didn't see youtube as much a search engine or dating website as a nice place to browse random videos</UTT>It dont think their initial intentions panned out.  They are a great place to see videos, I know I have personally wasted a lot of time there.  lol</UTT>I too have spent much time watching cute animal videos</UTT>Google created a network that watched 10 Million youtube clips, and it learned to recognize cats.</UTT>I guess that is one way to create AI. In any case, thanks for chatting.
t_3de96594-0d52-46d0-84c2-203d70fa46ae</CONV>did you know that Tom Brady has never eaten a strawberry before? haha</UTT>How is that possible? He must have some sort of allergy or something. The Rams could sneak some strawberries in his water today!</UTT>haha they should! or maybe that's what leads to success in life, never eating strawberries! maybe it unlocks a superpower</UTT>I wonder how today's SB will turn out for Brady and Belichick. Will it be a difference of 3 or 4 points again?</UTT>haha that is true, do you want the patriots to win? I do personally</UTT>I usually root for the underdog. In this case, I would like to see a close game. I don't like lopsided games. Boring after the first quarter or so.</UTT>well I guess most NFL games only have about 11 mins of actual live gameplay, so depending on your definition of boring that could be good or bad too haha</UTT>That leaves a lot of time for commercial. On a per-minute basis, the players get paid a lot. Did you know that the huddle originated because of a deaf QB?</UTT>I didn't know that, I'd imagine he did it though to cover up his hand signs so the other team could read his plays, that would make sense</UTT>I'm surprised that there's only one left-handed QB in the NFL. Thinking of all the QBs and all the lefties in other sports, that number seems low.</UTT>that does, I wonder if he gets an advantage or not for doing that, did you know that Tom Brady's wife actually makes more than double what he does?</UTT>She's a model, right? I think Tom probably makes money from endorsements as well. Plus, she can probably eat strawberries, so she has that going for her.</UTT>haha that is true, have you seen the Video of Tom Brady kissing his son? like he literally give him two big kisses on the lips, its kind of bizarre</UTT>Haven't seen that. That's about as weird as never eating a strawberry in your life. It's interesting that engineers make more over their careers than NFL players on average. I expected NFL would pay insane salaries, but I guess the career is short, so it doesn't matter.</UTT>ya I think so, I guess players need to be thrifty with their money when they stop playing, do you know why New orleans cheerleaders can't eat at the same restaurants as the actual football players? that seems bizarre</UTT>I think it's to discourage relationships between the two. The team might have had problems in the past.</UTT>ya it could be, it's so weird though that if a player comes in, the cheerleader is required to get up and leave the restaurant though, it seems unneccessary</UTT>The players have priority. The cheerleaders are treated badly. Their pay is low. They don't have much job security. From the outside, it's a glamorous job. Did you know that Tom Brady was never started by his high school JV team? Seems like a huge mistake on the coach's part.</UTT>ya it seems like he couldn't see the future talent, I guess Brady is considered a massive "steal" because of the team that got him in the draft, so it looks like even during the draft he was under-valued</UTT>Given the right coach, he was able to blossom. Probably also because he has good receivers.</UTT>that is true, football is a team effort and any one player is useless without working with the others on the team
t_d3d69e60-94df-4cc3-b79c-d9b85c07f641</CONV>How's it going, do you like Drama? It has been around since at least 335 BC</UTT>I do like drama. But I really love comedy!</UTT>Me too, I must admit I'm a fan of black comedy</UTT>That is cool! I would have never guessed but Evan Almighty is the most expensive comedy ever made. That movie was not even that good and they spent $200 mill.</UTT>Did you know that Demetri Martin was accepted into Harvard law but left for comedy?</UTT>That is crazy! But I love that he followed his passion. I can't believe that the green lantern film was going to be a comedy with Jack Black starring in it. Not so sure about that.</UTT>Sounds like a bad choice. Have you heard about bromantic comedies like Harold and Kumar and the Hangover?</UTT>I haven't and I never saw those movies!</UTT>They are pretty funny movies, Pineapple Express too, that is if you like stoner movies</UTT>I have never seen it! What do you think about John Hamm? He taught drama at his old high school.</UTT>He was great in Mad Men. Michael Caine took drama in high school, but he just wanted to meet girls</UTT>Look, John Hamm's student was Ellie Kemper from the office. I am sure he just wanted to meet her!</UTT>Yea she pretty and funny. Did you know Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas anymore due to his belief system?</UTT>Yes. He is weird. I don't even know what to think about him! Do you know that soap opera originated because they were sponsored by soap manufacturers in the past. Makes sense!</UTT>No but it does makes sense, I wonder if theres a website that streams soap operas like there is for classic episodes of radio dramas</UTT>I love some talk radio and podcasts. I am thinking I would enjoy that too. Have you heard of the show Ikea Heights?</UTT>No, what is that?</UTT>It is a melodrama shot at an ikea store without the store knowing.</UTT>Cool. Speaking of drama, Hugh Laurie is the highest paid drama actor on tv</UTT>The guy that plays in house? Is that right?</UTT>Yep. Well I got to go. Nice chatting with you
t_96085b48-77e2-4187-a4ed-68795f13c2c3</CONV>Hey how's it going? I think voting is so important. Astronauts even vote from space.</UTT>I agree.  I'm personally Republican.  I don't have a beard, but every US President with a beard has been a Republican.</UTT>Oh wow that is an interesting fact. The grand old party is definitely Conservative!</UTT>For sure, but the use of the color red to represent Republicans didn't start until 2000.</UTT>YesThat is interesting I thought it was always a moniker for the parties. I guess in the past the elephant used to be more representative of Republicans. Especially since Truman didn't even want to be pictured with one.</UTT>I think I heard of that.  I believe that was way back in 1957.</UTT>Yes exactly. Actually happened when Truman visited Disneyland and he didn't want to ride on the Dumbo ride.</UTT>Didn't want to be associated with the Republicans, but there hasn't been a President that was't a member of one of the two main parties since 1853.</UTT>Wow that is surprising they definitely have power. The last time a Republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928. I assume this doesn't account for the most recent election though.</UTT>Voting is so important though.  The Indian government once even set up a polling booth for one voter.</UTT>That is great to hear. Just got a watch out for those lions!</UTT>I know really!  You can vote for everything nowadays.  I think some people in TX even voted what to name their garbage dump.</UTT>I think it's funny that they voted on Fred Durst!</UTT>I guess if you're from Austin, TX, you must like Fred Durst.</UTT>Or they hate him and that's why they wanted to name garbage after him LOL. In any case I wonder if the rename actually happened?</UTT>Not sure.  That is a strange name though.  Almost as strange as the first president f Zimbabwe, President Banana</UTT>Yes exactly. I wonder what the president of Indonesia has for his nickname? Maybe pop king?</UTT>Possibly considering he released three pop albums while in office.</UTT>Yes I wonder how those albums were received in the country? Oddly enough the US presidents guest house is larger than the White House. It was nice talking with you this morning. Hope you have a good day.</UTT>Same to you.</UTT>Bye!
t_c76a47b2-d0f9-4505-96d9-4ba2d757f3cb</CONV>Hi, how are you?</UTT>Great.  Are you a fan of the NBA?  There's a battle going on about who will get Rookie of the Year, Ben Simmons or Donovan Mitchell.</UTT>I am a fan of the NBA. Are you?</UTT>Sorta kinda... Looking at the records, I think Simmons has a slight edge.</UTT>I think he did win it. But it was his second year. He was injured his first year so it didn't count.</UTT>OK. Did you know that Allen Iverson has a lifetime endorsement for Reebok for $800K a year?</UTT>Wow. Aren't both of those pretty washed up?</UTT>Yeah, not many people will remember Iverson in a few years. It's kind of cool that Tim Duncan stayed in school before going into the NBA.</UTT>He is a different cat. He liked school and what it brought.</UTT>Rarely see that... Did you know that in 39 of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is a college basketball or football coach?</UTT>Wow. I had no clue. Jordans were banned and nike paid the fines for jordan.</UTT>He wore them anyway huh? Funny, the New Zealand basketball team is call "Tall Backs".  I'm not sure what that means.</UTT>It means racism... Just kidding. I think it is their national name. Their rugby team is black 7s.</UTT>Far from the Utah Jazz, Jazz, the type of music, originated in New Orleans.</UTT>I love jazz. Do you like it?</UTT>Certain types. I like more of the traditional jazz.  I didn't know goatees were a jazz thing for jazz trumpeters.</UTT>It was a comfort thing, I believe...</UTT>Yes.  Did you know Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is topping the charts.  I wouldn't have guessed that.</UTT>Me neither and I try and stay on top of that stuff.</UTT>It's funny that physicists proved that shooting FTs granny style is actually better.</UTT>Nice chatting with you!

Are you a pretty big tennis fan?</UTT>huge fan. Almost as huge a fan as the helicopter blades they used to dry the court for the 69 US open. haha get it? funny joke</UTT>Haha, that was a good one, that sounds like a McGiver type move whoever came up with that idea.</UTT>i know, it sounds absolutely batshit crazy haha i would have wanted to sit in on that meeting</UTT>Agreed, someone probably got promoted after that move.</UTT>or at least a career in comedy</UTT>Lol, good call.  Did you know Federer once lost to a man that learned how to play just days earlier?</UTT>which is so embarassing, Federer is a name synonymous with men's tennis. i wonder where that other guy is now</UTT>That is exactly what I was thinking, what happened to that phenom who learned the game and days later beat one of the best ever.</UTT>the biggest injury in all of Federer's career wwas caused by a bad stretch when he was bathing his daughter. What odd fate he has</UTT>I think I heard about that before, it sounded like he tore some of his meniscus in his knee.</UTT>i dont know how that would even happen! must have been a big stretch</UTT>Yeah it sure must have been, I tore my ACL this past summer and had to get surgery so I feel his pain!</UTT>oh gosh how did you do that?</UTT>Playing indoor soccer, running hard one way, then turning and trying to plant another way, sucked a lot.  But, I didn't do it while not playing a sport like old Rog there.</UTT>yea at least you have an excuse! that sounds rough, thats my biggest fear when im playing sports</UTT>Yeah I had to miss about 3 months of work so financially not very good, not like old Rog, I'm sure he was plenty fine.</UTT>especially since his injury was in 2016, he already had so much career under his belt. his bank account was healthy im sure

YOu can maybe even play with the goats they hire to graze the grass</UTT>I am not so sure about being referred to as a noogler and wearing a beanie cap!</UTT>Hahaha. Apparently a single google search uses more computing power than sending Armstrong and 11 others to the moon</UTT>That is absolutely crazy.  I guess that is why google's data center uses about .01% of all total worldwide electricity</UTT>It would explain a lot. It once went down for about 5 minutes. Imagine if that was longer?</UTT>I love the fact that g-mail used to be a free email server on Garfield's website</UTT>Oh that is funny. Interesting thing about the borders and google maps too, adjusting them to what each country says</UTT>I did not know that.  Computers are amazing things and it is crazy to think about how much they have evolved since the 60s.</UTT>Yeah. the computer in charge of the space shuttle has a ram of only 1mb</UTT>Right  and now everything from a microwave oven to a remote control has a computer in it!</UTT>exactly. someone even built a 16-bit computer using only minecraft building blocks</UTT>And the first computer algorithm was written by a woman named Ada Lovelace.   She had a programming language named after her</UTT>It is said we do not know more about these people who built the foundations of important things</UTT>Absolutely. I love the fact that the first google computer at Stanford had enclosures made of Legos!</UTT>We have come so far from those days. Do you have much interest in the galaxy?</UTT>I do find stars interesting.  It is fascinating to consider stuff from outer space</UTT>Venus is the only planet that does not tilt to it is stuck with only one season all the time</UTT>Wow that is interesting.  I knew the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus in 1975</UTT>So much cool stuff. It was nice chatting with you.
t_00d8b7cf-5484-4ff0-88c9-d7bb2d299fad</CONV>I don't keep up on many TV shows, but every once in a while I see clips of various performances from artists on The Voice</UTT>I think The Voice its a great show, I like it and think there are a lot of telented people in the show, I liked Brynn Cartellis performance ons season 15</UTT>I've heard she's also the youngest winner on the show and the judges all wanted her. She must be very talented</UTT>Really the youngest one? I gues she made history then, I guess 15 years old is a young age, I meant I liked her performance on Season 14, I got the seasons all mixed up lol</UTT>People with that much talent and confidence at a young age are very rare. Many think she'll be a game changer when it comes to the success of the winners on the show</UTT>I guess it does change things, usually older artists have a better preparation and have more experience, she had a tough competition, Spensha Baker, Kyla Jade, Britton Buchanan, all of them great artists.</UTT>I think it helps that she was coached by Kelly Clarkson though, despite it being Kelly's first season as a coach. She's been through a similar process before and seen success</UTT>She did have a great coach, maybe Kelly was the perfect coach for her, she might have gone through similar problems in her carreer.</UTT>Some of the past winners have some quality music, but I think may have high expectations for this winner</UTT>I agree with you a song that I liked was Walk My Way, she said that its something people are listening to now, the tune can be heard in ratio stations and also on iTunes as well as other music servies</UTT>It's always cool to see people with talent succeed and create music that others enjoy listening to. Maybe one day she'll have as many hits as Kelly Clarkson or Lady Gaga</UTT>I think she will, she is a young artist and the only way is up, theres people in the industry that want to work with Cartelli so it would be a good thing to keep her in mind</UTT>Definitely. Many that we know today started out on a TV show. Did you know that Lady Gaga was on an MTV show called Boiling Points before her career took off?</UTT>I didnt know she was on a show before becoming famous, I guess thats why shes a good actress, the latest movie she was in was pretty good.</UTT>She started out performing as a teenager doing similar things to Cartelli. She dropped out of college to pursue music</UTT>I guess she took the right decision as she is now loaded with cash, she is the godmother of Elton Johns son, I bet that wouldnt have happen if she remained in college</UTT>I'm sure it wasn't easy though. She got her foot in the door through songwriting for a label first</UTT>I bet it was a hard road to success but most artists have to face difficulties,</UTT>But it's paid off. Now she has so many Twitter followers that the LAPD asked her to tweet information about road construction</UTT>Yeah I guess it did, do you like pop music?</UTT>I do enjoy most pop music, but it depends on the artist. Sometimes I'll even listen to K-Pop from countries like North Korea
t_b2ceca3b-2727-4f09-a512-63ef4e57a494</CONV>Hi there! Are you old enough to remember life before the internet?</UTT>I suppose so. It is odd to think that there was life before this.  In a way it was good. You weren't constantly being filmed or photographed, monitored by others.  Are you old enough to remember?</UTT>Yes. Most definately. You couldn't just Google something to solve an argument. You argued with your friends for DAYS. Ha. Now you can get cell service on Mt. Everest so you don't have to argue about whether or not Brad Pitt ever appeared in an episode of Friends.</UTT>Hahaha! True.  I think that the fact that cell and internet service is way up there is totally amazing.  I guess back in the day people weren't addicted either.  I mean, we didn't have the whole novelty of clicking anything.</UTT>Flipping through microfiche in the library doesn't produce the same rush. Now I would LOVE to abandon Facebook. I've been on it since 2006, just two years after it started and I'm sucked in and can't lave.</UTT>I know what you mean there. I think about leaving and then wonder if I'll miss something important posted by family and friends.  Mark Zuckerberg and his friends definitely knew what they were doing when the launched it back in the day.</UTT>I need it for work, which makes it twice as terrible. I'm pretty good about unfriending people. You know that Burger King promotion where they offered a free whopper if you unfriended 10 people? They owe me like 8 whoppers now.</UTT>I didn't know that but I think it's an interesting promotion.  I mean, what will people give up to get that free burger?</UTT>Apparently, I'd give up all my friends! The rise of the internet has also given us internet "celebrities," which is another reason to hate it.</UTT>Even still, Lebron James is the highest paid celebrity of them all you know.  Just under him is Judge Judy.</UTT>Give her time. She'll pass him. I know I'm old when I'm wistful for dead celebrities, like Robin Williams.</UTT>I liked him too. It was extremely sad to find out how and why he died.  I guess you just never know about people.  He seemed so happy, energetic, especially when he did animated films.</UTT>He was already animated. I also miss Carol Burnett, her variety show was hysterical and she didn't put on airs. She was the first celebrity to go on Sesame Street, which shows how down to earth she was.</UTT>She probably did not go into Pixar's secret room that is just for celebrities.</UTT>Yeah, that's sort of an obnoxious room to have. Bet you Zuckerberg has DOZENS of rooms for celebrities. All painted blue because he can't see red or green.</UTT>I've heard that about him.  It's the whole reason facebook is blue. I guess his wishes carried more weight than the guys that made the site with him.</UTT>I'll bet you MySpace is kicking themselves for not buying it back in 2005. What was that guy's name? Tom?</UTT>I don't know but I'm sure you are right.  Facebook is valued at $104 billion, or it was back in 2012 at least.</UTT>And they make money off our data. Pretty much legally. Because 93 percent of people don't read the terms of service and I'm sure it says right in there "by using Facebook, we own you. Forever.</UTT>Hahaha! It probably does at that!  Some places are taking small stands against facebook.  There's a state in germany that has made the like button illegal.</UTT>We should be like Germany in that regard.  Nice chatting with you!</UTT>We definitely should.  Don't forget, get we should get our burgers from burger king too!
t_f392f043-7d77-44a0-b7a9-9dde69d721f8</CONV>What do you think about Football?</UTT>Hello - I love football. What about you?</UTT>I like many different types of football, not just the gridiron versions.</UTT>Did you know the University of Iowa painted the visiting football team locker room pink?</UTT>That must have been distracting!    Perhaps something like that led to the big Georgia Tech win in 1916!</UTT>I agree. In the 1960's, top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars.</UTT>Things sure have changed!    Just like the virtual yellow first down line that won ESPN an emmy.</UTT>Yep, that was a lifesaver for watching on TV. The highest football score ever was 222-0.</UTT>Quarterback is my favorite position on the field.</UTT>I like WR and RB. Did you know Green-Ellis never fumbled the football in his NFL career?</UTT>Amazing!   Kind of like the story of the Junipero Serra High School JV team!</UTT>Yes! The huddle was formed due to a QB who was deaf and didn't want the other team to see the play.</UTT>Interesting!    Football teams are quite funny things!</UTT>I agree. I saw that Baker Mayfield once thought about quitting football to play professional gaming.</UTT>Did you know the band Kiss once purchased an Arena Football team!</UTT>I did not know that. The Eagles had a temporary court set up in their stadium for six years due to fans bad behavior.</UTT>I wonder if fans are responsible for burning down the science building during a high school game in 1965.</UTT>I'm not too sure on that one. 14 of the world's 25 largest stadiums belong to American college football teams.</UTT>It makes you wonder why someone like Alex Smith would want to leave college sooner than he has to.  Money, I guess.</UTT>Probably the money for sure. Who is your favorite football team.</UTT>I really like the University of Iowa.   In fact, I think I will go rewatch a game right now!
t_5328d32b-04d7-47ee-86ef-46e83bbd263a</CONV>How's it going, did you know audio cassettes albums began in the 1970s?</UTT>I didn't know that. What about CDs, in the 80s?</UTT>I remember reading how expensive they were back then. I prefer cds to the mp3 format that's been used since the early 2000s</UTT>What about the radio, do you listen to the radio?</UTT>Yea, it's pretty crazy how you're able to manipulate the amplitude of radio wave to listen to music on a radio</UTT>That it is. Did you know there is a website where you can listen to classical radio dramas?</UTT>No, that's pretty cool. I wonder if WWII soldiers were able to listen to radio dramas with their foxhole radios</UTT>They were, they could make radios out of razorblades and pencils.</UTT>I'd really like to listen to Jupiter's radio storms using an am radio, I wonder what frequency picks them up</UTT>I'm not sure, I wonder what it sounds like.</UTT>Probably a lot better than Canadian radio that by law requires 40% of the music played to be Canadian lol</UTT>Interesting, it must be not very good up there then to listen.</UTT>Well it's probably better than listening to the classical latin program 'Nuntii Latni' that is broadcasted in Finland</UTT>Yeah, that is for sure. I don't speak latin, do you?</UTT>Nope. I think I'd rather listen to the 100 year old identical twins who released a rap album in Japan</UTT>What did they rap about, do you know?</UTT>I have no idea, maybe gangsta rap since the twins released it in 1992</UTT>Did you know that babies dance when they hear music?</UTT>Yea, and babies also smile more when listening to music beats</UTT>Interesting, they can probably dance better than me. LOL</UTT>Me too. Well it was nice chatting with you
t_20692781-6c63-4278-b671-32ad4d3e43b1</CONV>Did or do you like Dr. Seuss' "The Grinch"?</UTT>Yeah both classics, The Grinch is one of my favorites, what about you?</UTT>I like all of Dr. Seuss's books.  Even though this latest production has great actors, I'm not sure about the adult themes (e.g., LGBTQ, date rape and language). It's a kid thing right?</UTT>Doesnt seem that way,, Boy Erased is not a book for kids at least, more for like teens.</UTT>Yes. Funny, Dr. Seuss was voted least likely to succeed by this classmates.  He showed them!</UTT>I guess he did, he has left a legacy behind and what have they done?</UTT>Yes.  "Brainchild" looks promising.  They even hired a science expert for it.</UTT>Its a science inpires series right? that does seem like a great thing I would like my kid to stream that,</UTT>Sound like it.  I'm not sure about "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina".  There's an orgy and bad language.</UTT>Do you like reading drama books? or watching drama shows?</UTT>Yes, some of them.  I like Michael Caine... He's apparently a rascal in real life.  He got into drama because all the hot girls at his school were taking it.</UTT>Thats funny, his one of the most talented actors now, guess thats as good excuse as any</UTT>For sure... Did you know Netflix uses 33% of N. America's bandwidth between 9am to 12am?  Wow.</UTT>33% wow, that sure is a lot, wow, how many subscribers do you  think the service has by now?</UTT>More than I can count... They also spend 20 times more on postage than they do for bandwidth.</UTT>I wonder why, isnt Netflix an online service only?</UTT>I thought so... I may have read an old article.  I'm surprised to learn that Dr. Seuss was afraid of kids!?  He's made so many of them happy.</UTT>Really? thats kind of ironic lol, Dr Seuss was a weird mate</UTT>It appears so... It's also weird that Blockbuster turned down many offers to buy Netflix for $50M.  It's worth $2B now.  Doh!</UTT>I bet they are  kicking themselves over that decision, interesting how Netflix started</UTT>Yeah, fines can be quite a motivation!  Thanks for the chat.  You were excellent!
t_5d689115-888d-4fb8-afae-a715db6c5563</CONV>Hello! Do you like football?</UTT>I love it! You?</UTT>Not a huge fan but I do watch sometimes, I like the New England Patriots...How about you?</UTT>I am a Chicago Bears fan. They just lost so I was pretty bummed. You're playing this weekend, right?</UTT>Oh wow, sorry! I believe so, I would have to look lol....The Buffalo Bills are equal to the Patriots in losses...weird.</UTT>Yeah, the cleveland browns' last playoff win was in 1995 against the new england patriots and their head coach was bill belichick. this was bill's first playoff win as head coach and the only playoff win as head coach outside the patriots.</UTT>Oh wow, The Patriots are just a great team I think</UTT>They are. And International! New england patriot sebastian vollmer is the first german citizen drafted into the nfl</UTT>Cool! Didn't know that. The author of Game of Thrones....called the Patriots the lannisters of the NFL lol</UTT>That seems like mean thing to say! The new england patriots under tom brady and bill belichick have either won or lost the super bowl by 3 or 4 points in all 6 tries.</UTT>So crazy! I know! So who is your fav quarterback?</UTT>I would have to say Aaron Rodgers even though I am supposed to hate him, as a bears fan.</UTT>haha, he is awesome! Did you know there was a deaf quarterback that invented the huddle? So nobody could read his hand signals! Very cool.</UTT>That is. Superbowl winning quarterback, brad johnson, is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass... to himself.</UTT>What? hahhaaa.....did you know Baker Mayfield almost quit football to pursue competitive gaming! What that's nuts.</UTT>Doesn't he seem like someone who would quit football to game? Or play poker.</UTT>True true hahaa...</UTT>Nfl quarterback russell wilson is still under a major league baseball contract despite not playing in a regular season game since 2011. the texas rangers traded him in february 2018 to the ny yankees</UTT>Cool fact! I didn't know that! Alex Smith took so many Ap tests in hs and got his bachelors in 2 years, must be smart!</UTT>The jacksons "victory tour" played a major role in robert kraft buying sullivan stadium, and eventually the new england patriots.</UTT>True!  i LOVE the Patriots!</UTT>Really? Who you playing this weekend?</UTT>The Chargers I believe...</UTT>Nice! Worried? They don't seem to have the same magic they had when they were winning titles.</UTT>No, not worried...I hope they win but I am a loyal fan so...either way! Fingers crossed lol Can always hope! It has been great chatting!!!</UTT>Nice chatting with you.
t_aa3f3c76-68db-4788-a268-6b7c6b4c2b1e</CONV>Do you find the universe interesting?</UTT>I find it fascinating. The universe is cosmic, man.</UTT>It is interesting, time, space, planets, galaxies theres just so much to explore</UTT>Yes, we know so little. I wonder about the theory of natural selection of universes. what about our current universe? are we good?</UTT>I think we have a strong universe, there is also a theory that the universe may be a giant superhologam.</UTT>I think that sounds odd. what does that make you and me? are we tiny holograms? Am i chatting with a hologram?</UTT>No, your not chatting with a hologram so dont worry lol, I wish we could travel to other planets and galaxies.</UTT>Yes, that will happen in our lifetime, but i dont know what will come of it. it will be possible to put a person on mars, but not for long.</UTT>Maybe one day the human kind can adapt and a civilization can be started at the planet, hope Im alive when that day comes.</UTT>Yes, we would need birth certificates and passports for new planets. A brave new world!</UTT>A brave new world indeed, I guess you like reading and Shakespeare ?</UTT>I like reading. I havent read much shakespeare. I have read a couple of books from the military reading list.</UTT>Any that you would recommend? I liked Ender's Game, thought it was a nice novel.</UTT>It was a good book. i read it long ago. i never saw the movie. Starship Troopers was fun too.</UTT>It was a fun movie, I liked it I wonder if the book was any good? usually books are better than movies.</UTT>I have to agree. FIlms are good, but the written word is superior for some stories. I think film should not try to imitate or supersede prose. it is different.</UTT>Do you like C.S. Lewis and Tolkien?</UTT>Yes, I like Tolkien. I read Lewis a long time ago.</UTT>Both are really write authors, they used to have a funny game together.</UTT>Oh, who laughs, loses? that sounds great! i would love to witness that! ANyway, great chat!</UTT>It does sound like a great game to play, it was fun chatting I agree hope we can do it again, have a nice day.
t_cde6fc6f-e4c1-452a-bda1-05737ea008dc</CONV>I would like to visit the White House some day, so many history in one place.</UTT>It is a wonderful place. But the president there now is making false statement.</UTT>What false statement is the president making? I know its a sensible subject but I don't like Trump or he's managing the country.</UTT>President Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told Fox News that the federal budget deficit is declining, but it's actually growing.</UTT>I wonder why his advisor lied about this, it seems like its a basic economic number and a mistake that can be easily perceived.</UTT>Indeed, the deficit in fiscal year 2017 ($665 billion) was bigger than it was in fiscal year 2016 ($587 billion)</UTT>That is a huge deficit, I worry about the numbers in 2020 as it will climb to 1 trillion annually.</UTT>yes that is a number not hit since the recession spurred Congress to pass an economic stimulus package in 2009.</UTT>that will have some serious consequences to the country, hopefully this problem gets solved before it arrives to that.</UTT>I'm fearful</UTT>I am too, the 09 reccession was pretty harsh, there shoud be some budget cuts.</UTT>I don't think that's going to happen what with Trump approving a billion dollar border wall. Ugh.</UTT>Yeah, that is one of the silliest expenses, you can give a much better use to that money.</UTT>Indeed. Do you know that the first president of zimbabwe was called president banana?</UTT>I did not know that, that is a fun fact, who gets called after a fruit?</UTT>I know, that's a good line for a dinner party.</UTT>Yeah, I will probably use that one next time I eat with friends, heres another fun fact, Elmo is the only non-human to testify before the u.s congress</UTT>OMG, lol. I wonder what he testified about?</UTT>Aparently Elmo testified before the Education Appropriations subcommittee in support for music education programs, Elmo was wearing a cool suit.</UTT>Oh cool, Elmo is a cute guy! I have to look that up.</UTT>You should definetely do it! and Elmo is the best!
t_37c30fbb-df4c-40df-b2b9-66a480855f8d</CONV>Do you enjoy watching basketball?</UTT>I used to, now I rarely watch. I still like to play though ;)</UTT>I am amazed at how much the players are paid to play.  While I do agree that the level they play at requires a great deal of skill, it still blows me away how much some of their contracts are worth.  When they start talking millions, it just floors me.</UTT>No, I hear You - especially when some of them never finished high school...</UTT>Basketball is big around here since I live near the city where our NBA team plays out of.  I just learned that the NBA has been around since the 1940's.  I had no idea it was so recent.</UTT>Yeah, and the front seats on major games cost so much that only celebrities can afford. I remember I always liked to watch cheerleaders</UTT>Well, when the players and coaches are making as much as they are, they have to pay them some way.  I think the coaches make almost as much as the players themselves</UTT>No way... :) I always thought the coaches didn't contribute much :) Those players know how to play without them :)</UTT>It seems that way sometimes.  I wonder if coaches have contracts like the players do.  Can you imagine having a 4 year contract but getting 10's of millions of dollars, on top of that all the product endorsements.</UTT>I think they do, I'm not sure... yeah - they earn quite a lot... its insane when You compare that to what we earn... quite depressing :)</UTT>So here's a funny bit of trivia.  Did you know that Jordan was banned from wearing air jordan's to games when they were initially released.  How weird is that.  Why would they ban a shoe from a basketball game?  Maybe they are that amazing.  haha</UTT>Maybe it was making him taller ? lol, I really don't know;)</UTT>The funny part is, he still wore them to games because Nike paid the fines.  I guess the fines are worth it so you can sell more shoes.</UTT>Good old Nike :) I wonder how high was the fine ? It couldn't be a lot ;)</UTT>I wonder how the league affords to pay their players so much money.  It seems like it would be difficult to meet those obligations.</UTT>I guess from TV broadcasting and commercials... gadgets selling online, I'm not even sure ;)</UTT>I don't really understand the players switching teams all of the time.  Wouldn't it be hard to change teams and then start playing against your old team mates.  And then how do the fans stay loyal when the players change?  I admit, I am not much of a basketball fan myself.</UTT>in that world, sometimes it's all about the money. Just like political parties... even if they don't even believe in what they preach, they are getting big bucks for it ;)</UTT>Well, maybe I will give basketball another shot.  Thanks for talking with me about basketball.  I always like to hear what other people think about the sport.</UTT>My pleasure, it was always a big part of my childhood. Matches with friends, movies, games on tv, even computer games :)</UTT>Great, thanks.

You?</UTT>Yes me too sometimes. Do you know why managers wear uniforms during the game?</UTT>I think they can rush on the field at a moment's notice to play a position. Highly unlikely though.</UTT>Yeah, interesting and good for them just in case. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?</UTT>I dunno. Canadian kickball?</UTT>It is actually called soccer-baseball</UTT>That makes sense. Canadians would find the middle-of-the-road term for the sport. What about the man who found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? That's pretty cool.</UTT>That is for sure, he made a lot of money there. DO you know who used to do the schedule for the major baseball league games?</UTT>I figured the schedule would be done by computer. Who does it?</UTT>It was a couple who did it for 24 years straight</UTT>Wow. That must have been a pretty sweet job. I wonder how much it paid.</UTT>Yeah that is a sweet gig for sure. They scheduled 2430 games a year</UTT>That is a lot of games, but maybe year to year it doesn't vary so much. Get it right once and the following years are straightforward.</UTT>True. In Japan baseball is so popular that they cannot believe it is a pastime in the US</UTT>I think the Japanese are not aware of many things outside of their country. Until a Japanese person does something important outside of Japan.</UTT>I guess. Did you know the CUbs were the first team to win back to back world series?</UTT>The Cubs! How ironic! They struggled for so long to get a Series!</UTT>Yeah, and they have not won ever since</UTT>That is a curse if I've ever heard of one. Well, someone needs to hire a gypsy woman to lift the curse.</UTT>I guess. Nice chat

It's kind of interesting, but not my favorite art form.</UTT>Yea, I like martial arts, it's funny Bruce lee was also a cha-cha championship</UTT>Bruce had great body control. He probably could have done the Olympics too.</UTT>Yea, I wonder how many Shoes Bruce went through if ballet dancers go through 4 a week</UTT>Bruce could probably dance barefoot. He could have danced ballet too.</UTT>I wonder how well Bruce could do the extreme lean that Michael Jackson used a patented device to do</UTT>Bruce wouldn't have the patent, but I bet he do something pretty close.</UTT>Probably not, it's shocking how many people have taken ballet though, Tupac even did it and played the mouse king in the nutcracker</UTT>Tupac was interested in art in many forms. I wonder if anyone has a recording of him dancing ballet.</UTT>It's possible, maybe someone posted a video on facebook since it was founded in 2004</UTT>Facebook has so much stuff on it. I don't use it much, but I understand the attraction.</UTT>Yea and facebook makes a killing off advertisements, enough to be valued at 104 billion</UTT>Boy, those Myspace folks must be kicking themselves now. $75 million? That's nothing!</UTT>Yea facebook really screwed up not coughing up that $75 million in 2005 to buy facebook</UTT>Iceland seems to be embarking on a bold project with their constitution.</UTT>Yea but I don't think it's a good idea to use a medium such as facebook to rewrite a constitution, I don't think Iceland is pretty smart for that</UTT>There could be problems. Hackers and such. Apple had a clothing line in 1986. I wonder if Facebook will ever have one.</UTT>I hope not, maybe they could get Rip Curl to making clothing for them using North Korean workers</UTT>I think that must be a legal violation. You can't do business with North Korea.</UTT>Well I got to go, nice talking with you
t_e751e63c-d5a7-4bb8-9e15-e1ed244f8cb0</CONV>Have you heard that the Orlando nightclub shooter trial is winding down?</UTT>Yes, that was disgusting.  One big question is whether the shooter's wife was involved.</UTT>Yes.  That is actually the trial I had heard about.  I don't know the facts used to try her, but I hope justice will be done either way.</UTT>Supposedly, Omar Mateen first wanted to attack a Disney shopping complex, but changed his mind due to strong police presence.</UTT>Soft targets are a problem.  I have toured the underground at DisneyWorld.  If someone gets drunk on the property, he or she finds that he or she is soon underground a leaving the park without making a spectacle.</UTT>Noor Salman demonstratedly lied about number of things about her husband under interrogation.  Now she says she didn't know about the attack.</UTT>Again, I hope justice is done.  I have been a foreman on a jury in a capital murder case.  No one sees the facts that are legal to be seen except the jury.  As a spectator, I suspect her of being guilty.  She knew what he planned to do according to her statements after the fact.</UTT>She knew her husband was planning an attack in support of ISIS.</UTT>I agree that is how it looks.</UTT>The defense is trying to paint Salman as unsophisticated.  Sounds sexist to me!</UTT>Well the defense lawyer must do his or her best to present a defense with a chance of winning.  That is our system.  You do make a great point about sexism.</UTT>Now she says she wishes she would have informed the police about her husband's plans.  OK, yeah.</UTT>However, she was acquitted in March of last year.  Did you know that the slow rotary dial telephones took so much time to dial that New York was assigned 212 area code so it would dial quickly?</UTT>I heard that once.  The dial telephone was invented by an undertaker who thought operators were routing calls intended for him to a rival.</UTT>I know that undertaker story.. He was in Kansas.  Older phones and phones today convert sound into electronic signals and back again.</UTT>Sound reproduction on telephones is good enough for dolphins to recognize and communicate with each other.</UTT>I did not know that.  Phones only transmit about 3000 hertz.  The undersea cables are only 2.7 inches in diameter.</UTT>Phone service is optimized to sound humans can hear.  A luxury phone maker gets exclusive ringtones recorded by the London Symphony  Orchestra.</UTT>I have used custom ringtones, but I never paid more than 99 cents for one.  An iphone has more computing power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent</UTT>Computers get more powerful all the time.  Both men and women can program them.  In fact, Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer algorithm.  They later named a programming language. Ada, after her.</UTT>That's a nice tribute, but programming languages don't last long.  Nice chat!

There are more tiger pets in the us than there are in asia in the wild</UTT>That makes me really sad, they are supposed to be in the wild</UTT>Yes agreed. Roosevelt has 20 pets and among the a hyena and a bear</UTT>Wow good for him. In Japan there are more pets than kids under 15</UTT>Wow that is crazy. In Colorado you are the guardian and not the owner of the pet</UTT>I like that we should adopt it for the other states as well, all across</UTT>I agree with that. Do you use your phone much?</UTT>All the time actually. DO you know why the area code of NY is 212?</UTT>I think it is because it was easy to dial it on a rotary phone right?</UTT>Yes that was it Did you ever use a phone book as well?</UTT>Nope I did not but I heard if two of them get stuck it is impossible to separate them</UTT>Nice one. UNICEF donates water when we do not use the phone.</UTT>Wow I wonder how that works, maybe we should then all use it less and less</UTT>I think so too. Do you like cats?</UTT>I do actually, there are cat cafes in Japan, sounds pretty cool</UTT>Yeah it sure does. When cats reach 15 years of age they have slept for 10 years out of that</UTT>I think that is definitely what they do best.

That's a skill that many modern recruits have these days.</UTT>The way the world is heading I think we may be heading to a galaxy far far away!</UTT>And some xbox controllers are created for quadriplegics.  I wonder how that works.</UTT>I actually saw something about that, the controllers have huge buttons for people with limited functions.</UTT>I understand that Ringo Starr, George Carlin and Alec Baldwin narrated Thomas the Tank Engine.  That's an interesting series of narrators!</UTT>They are but I wish Star Wars had a narrator for the beginning introduction!</UTT>I've never been a Star Wars fan.  Too many movies, books, theme park attractions.</UTT>That's too bad it's a great franchise, you catch the new TV show Titans?</UTT>No, haven't even heard of it.  What's it about?</UTT>It's a new show on the DC streaming service it features Robin, Starfire, Raven and Beast Boy from the comics, you should check it out the season 1 finale is today!</UTT>If I get the time, I will.

What about yourself.</UTT>I see it sometimes but when I actually search for a rating I usually go to IMDB.  Michael Bay's average rating is 38%.  That seems harsh.</UTT>That is harsh! They are hard on their scale, especially with video game films.</UTT>I thought it was just me.  That's why I like IMDB.  I can't believe Spykids got a 93% rating.</UTT>That is better than Lincoln and the dark knight rises!</UTT>Yeah.  It's also hard to believe that Netflix has 150 movies available with a 100% rating. C'mon, nothing is 100%.  I wonder what Netflix paid for those endorsements?</UTT>I completely agree. Something is fishy about that!</UTT>Did you know that Pixar Studio has a secret room that celebrities often visit?  I wonder what in there?</UTT>I wonder if their is a way to purchase expensive tickets to get an inside look.</UTT>I don't know.  Maybe you could fake being a celebrity.  It wouldn't take much in the way of brains. Wow, Judge Judy's (actually is smart) pulls down $123K per episode!</UTT>That makes her the highest paid celebrity only after lebron james.</UTT>I wonder if that will last for James.  He was terrible in LA.  He could always become a chef in Ethiopia.</UTT>I love that chefs are encouraging everyone to eat more diverse foods.</UTT>I have a friend that's one.  He's really cool.  I think Carol Burnett was cool to appear on Sesame Street.</UTT>The first of many celebrities to appear!</UTT>Bill Nye got his break somewhere else when he won a Steve Martin lookalike contest.  I don't see the resemblance.</UTT>I do not see the resemblance either. I wonder if they made him wear a specific outfit with hair and makeup.</UTT>Probably...  You never know, Ronald Reagan once didn't get a part because he didn't have "that presidential look".  The jokes on them...</UTT>It is sad that we stereotype presidents into certain looks.</UTT>I guess Obama blew the white guy stereotype.  That may be his biggest accomplishment in his 8 years.  I didn't know my trusty NES only displayed 54 colors?!</UTT>I did not know that either. It was nice talking to you.
t_dff28c4a-88a5-48e2-a714-a3fdcddfe0b4</CONV>Hello, are you a fan of drama?</UTT>It depends on the type. I find some soap operas to be a little cheesy, but they're good enough to have been sponsored by soap manufacturers</UTT>Yeah they can be too exaggerated sometimes. I don't know if they were always meant to be that way, drama actually came from the Greek word meaning "action".</UTT>I think even the Greeks enjoyed exaggeration. Some really enjoy drama though, especially Patrick Stewart. He still teaches master classes in the UK</UTT>That's interesting, I didn't know he'd still do that. I know Michael Caine actually joined drama class only because the prettiest girls were in it.</UTT>I know many boys who did that in high school/ I want to check out the show called IKEA Heights. It's filmed in one of the stores without the store knowing</UTT>Huh that certainly seems like an interesting drama. I wonder if it's free to see, I listen to a lot of classic radio dramas because they are free on a website.</UTT>That sounds interesting. Sometimes I get enough drama in real life, like when my roommate's fish died. Have you ever had that experience?</UTT>No, I haven't! I've always wanted to own fish because they can be interesting, but never have.</UTT>I would start with a goldfish because they tend to be easy. The oldest one was 43 years old before it died</UTT>Perhaps you should have gotten a jellyfish instead! There is a brand that is immortal I believe.</UTT>Wow! If you're not careful, they can evaporate in the sun since they are 98% water</UTT>That's crazy the percentage is so high, especially considering they only drink water through their skin through osmosis.</UTT>That is pretty crazy! Another fun fish to have would be the barreleye fish since the head is transparent</UTT>That must be some sight, just don't put it in the same tank as a black swallower fish, because they can eat over ten times their weight.</UTT>You would need a big tank to hold that one! I've heard koi are good fish to have. There was one that lived 226 years</UTT>Still not as good as the immortal jellyfish though! I think I could best relate to seahorses though, at least they have necks like us.</UTT>Except that male seahorses are the ones who get pregnant. There is a species of fish that spends its adult life on land</UTT>Just like humans then! I wonder if they can synthesize their own vitamin C, that's something I know we can't do.</UTT>We also can't breathe and swallow at the same time like other mammals can!</UTT>We also can be scared by a certain sound frequency, seems we're inadequate in many areas. Anyways, it was nice chatting to you, have a good night!
t_c1ccd3d0-8d47-4990-bd95-38c487b676f5</CONV>How's it going, did you know the 3 horizontal line menu on webpages is called a hamburger button?</UTT>I did not! Do you know why it's called that?</UTT>I guess whoever created the menu was really craving a hamburger at the time</UTT>Good answer! I'm craving one myself now! I do know that constant clicking on buttons can turn into a addiction.</UTT>Yea I mean now you can even click on things at the Peak of Mt. Everest using 3g cell service</UTT>Well, I only get 1g here, so I would be in wonder at the peak of Mt. Everest!</UTT>That sucks, I wonder how long it would take to load the saved copy of the internet at the Library of Alexandria with 1g</UTT>I probably could not do it. At night pictures wont load here at all. Do you read the full terms when buying a product?</UTT>No I'm definitely not one of the 7% of people who read the full terms after buying something online</UTT>I try! Do you have sunny weather today where you are?</UTT>nope, cloudy and cold. It's crazy the Sun is 99.86% of the total mass in the Solar System</UTT>Isn't that wild? Sunny here, but cold too. I wish we could harness the energy from the sun. It would be free for all!</UTT>Yea, one second of energy from the sun could meet the Earth's energy needs of 500,000 years</UTT>That would be so nice, especially right now! Free heat! Although the sun is big, it's only 1 billionth the size of the biggest ever found.</UTT>A lightning bolt is 5x hotter than the sun, I wonder if people can harness that energy</UTT>That would be wild! Do you listen to the radio while you work?</UTT>Not really but I'd love to try and pick up Jupiters radio storms on an am radio</UTT>I would love to hear that too. In canada they radio stations have to play 40% of their music by canadian singers. So justin beiber should do well!</UTT>I think I'd rather listen to the all latin broadcast of nuntii latini.</UTT>Did you know soldiers made a simple radio from a razorblade and a pencil? in the foxhole too!</UTT>That sound awesome. Well I got to go, nice talking with you
t_fe1b893b-bcff-4376-bd64-282caaf7e54e</CONV>hi how are you? doyou like to dance?</UTT>Hello. I like to dance in front of the mirror sometimes. Lol. I havent done much dancing otherwise.</UTT>I am a terrible dancer. it is better if i do not dance in front of others. i could do them harm. LOL</UTT>That makes me think of bruce lee. He was a very good dancer, winning the 1958 cha cha championship. Plus he could also do some harm to people.</UTT>Yes, i hope he didnt do any harm on the dance floor. i am sure that i would have done some harm LOL</UTT>Lol. Tupac was also a dancer in high school. He danced ballet. Not exactly what I would have pictured from him.</UTT>me neither. he was a guy with a tough image. but i bet he was graceful too. he was a back up dancer for a band.</UTT>I didnt know that. I did hear that michael Jackson has a patent on a device he used in his dancing.</UTT>that is smart. michael was an innovator. it is important to hold on to clever ideas. I bet i would have trouble using those shoes though. LOL</UTT>He really was. On another topic, are you a baseball fan.</UTT>Yes, i do like baseball. i dont get m,uch chance to watch it though. i try to watch the world series.</UTT>I used to collect baseball cards when I was a kid. I heard about this guy that found 3 million dollars worth of old cards in his grandpas attic. That would sure be nice.</UTT>that sure would be nice. LOL i would probably sell a few of them, and keep the rest for the future. those things would appreciate.</UTT># million dollars is a lot of money though. I think I could find some better investments to put that money into.</UTT>Yes, i would look for better investments to. baseball cards are cool, but money is better.</UTT>Were you aware that baseball managers wear team uniforms?</UTT>I thought about that, and i think that in the old days, one of the players was chosen to be a manager too.</UTT>Actually its because the manager is able to play if he needs to. I have never seen that happen though.</UTT>it would be funny to see that happen nowadays. all the managers playing at the same time. LOL</UTT>Or if they just had one manager pinch hitting and the other pitching. They could face off for the last out of the game. That would be pretty awesome.</UTT>Yes, the old guard out there, do or die! Anyway, thanks for the chat</UTT>Have a good one.
t_23c05c38-fbad-4d3a-89b1-09567cfd9b26</CONV>Do you happen to enjoy pop music?</UTT>I do, I like Queen myself. Did you know that it's been scientifically proven that "We Are The Champions" is the catchiest pop song of all time?</UTT>I did not but I love Queen. Are you familiar with K-pop?</UTT>I'm kind of familiar with it.</UTT>Me too. There are several songs that stick in my head It's catchy. There is a K-pop band called Moranbong Band that is the most popular music group in the country. I am not familiar with their music.</UTT>I've never heard of them before. I heard that rejection letters from Sub Pop Records to aspiring artists start with "Dear loser." That's kind of disheartening.</UTT>Wow! I new they were an edgy company but that's harsh. Did you know that Ricky Gervais was a pop singer in the 80's? I cannot picture that.</UTT>I've heard that and I can't believe it. I'm glad he stuck with comedy instead of that.</UTT>Me too. Do you like to attend concerts?</UTT>I do, I'm actually attending one next weekend. I wish I could have been at the Foo Fighters concert that was so loud it showed up on New Zealand's seismic monitors!</UTT>I didn't know that happened. I do love the Foo Fighters though. Did you know that in 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts because their album was so successful?</UTT>Oh wow, that's alot of concerts. That album is one of my favorites. Have you heard about Deep Purple breaking the record for the loudest concert in 1972? Three audience members were rendered unconscious!</UTT>I did not. That seems excessive to me. I'm surprised Deep Purple would be the ones to play a concert that loud. Did you know that The Ramones played 2,263 concerts over the span of their career?</UTT>That's a lot of concerts! Wow. Did you know that Abba turned down $1 BILLION to do a 100 concert reunion tour?</UTT>I did not. Wow! They must still have a lot of money saved to be able to turn that down. I don't like to laugh at the misfortune of others but I find it amusing that concert attendees filed a lawsuit against Creed because their concert was so bad.</UTT>That is pretty funny. It must have been towards then end of Creed.</UTT>I would assume so. I also recently learned that Pink Floyd held a concert in 1972 with no audience. I wonder why they did that?</UTT>Oh wow, that's kind of odd. I heard that in 2010 Lou Reed and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs. I'm sure they enjoyed it.</UTT>Lou Reed is a weird guy so I'm not that surprised. There is an ancient Roman amphitheater in Croatia that is used as a concert venue. I bet that would be amazing.</UTT>That would be an amazing experience seeing a band playing there.</UTT>It would leave you with a story to tell for sure. I would take so many pictures.
t_6c8f6c09-2578-44ab-a953-abcbca7e9d41</CONV>Good Morning!  Do you watch football?</UTT>Good morning!  No, I don't.  Do you?</UTT>Very little, just usually around super bowl time.</UTT>Same here.  Have you ever heard of Colton McCoy?  I have not</UTT>Yeah.  I know he was a real standout in college.  He ended up with the Redskins</UTT>Looks like he is going to be their backup. He threw a 57 yard pass it looks like.</UTT>57 yards!  That is pretty incredible.  I think he will do pretty well in the league.</UTT>With an arm like that he should.  Did you know Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's football team?</UTT>I heard that, I bet it is pretty interesting.  I think that is great involvement.</UTT>Yeah, it is.  I'd love to hear that song for sure.</UTT>Did you hear about that game in 1916?  Highest scoring game ever.</UTT>No, I didn't here about that.  What was the score?</UTT>222-0.  GA Tech crushed Cumberland.</UTT>WOW!  You would think they would have called it off at some point!  Did you hear how much it cost to build the high school stadium in allen, texas?</UTT>No, wasnt it outrageous, like millions?</UTT>Yeah, 60 million.  It seats 18,000.  I guess there's not much else to do in that town but go to a high school game</UTT>True.  Did you hear that Tom Brady wasnt given the chance to play on his JV team in HS?  They didnt ever score yet they kept him on the bench.</UTT>I hadn't heard that.  I guess he showed them!  He's in good company. Micheal Jordan got cut from his high school team, I believe.</UTT>He did.  It is the perseverance and the will to succeed that makes them the athletes that they are!</UTT>Very true!  A great life lesson to learn.  The PAtriots have certainly done better than the Browns.  They haven't won a playoff game since 1995!</UTT>I dont know if the Dolphins have even seen the playoffs in that long LOL.  Great Chat!  Have a nice day!
t_d76652b3-3246-4bdd-992f-772472b8100c</CONV>hey do you like comic books? I guess Stan Lee who created a lot of comic book characters always uses the word Excelsior!</UTT>Sure. Did you know that Marvel published a generic comic book in order to trademark the names super-hero and super-villain</UTT>oh wow no I didn't, did you know that DC stands for detective comics? I never knew that</UTT>they say that its company name is redudant due to that.</UTT>ha-ha that makes sense, I live in Michigan and actually MSU has the largest public comic book collection</UTT>good to know. It is impressive to know that the first modern comic book was released in the US in 1933. They have been for decades.</UTT>wow that is wild, do you watch movies? The movie deadpool is based on a comic and I guess the videogame of Deadpool somehow cost more than the movie they made</UTT>I don't understand how, but indeed cost more. Ryan Reynolds stars as Deadpool in Twentieth Century Fox?</UTT>ah ya I did, did you see deadpool 2? I didn't like it as much as the first</UTT>It was good. what do you think about reading 4700 words per minute record?</UTT>I disagree, I 'm not sure if it's possible to retain that much information, do you read a lot?</UTT>Yes, I do. Did you know that on the 18th century there was a moral panic due to the spread of reading of novels?</UTT>haha I didn't know that, have you seen the movie starship troopers? apparently that book is recommended reading for the us military</UTT>No, I haven't, but they also say that is the first sci-fi novel on the reading list.</UTT>ya, and the thing is the movie is very anti war and anti military, so that is why it is so crazy they would recommend it!</UTT>Enders game was also suggested for many military organizations.</UTT>ya have you seen that movie? It's also not very pro military and I didn't like it even though I like Harrison Ford, what about you?</UTT>no, it is not my type of movie.</UTT>do you like lord of the rings? I like how he would read bad poetry with his friend and do laughing contests at reading it haha</UTT>Yes, I do. reading requires creativity and critical analysis.</UTT>yes that's true, I also Like how Deadpool is one of the highest grossing R rated movies ever made, I really like the first one a lot
t_6ad17dfa-82d8-4b4f-9f47-922b174f0fc7</CONV>Hello - did you know a man was falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spent most of his time at the library to prove his innocence?</UTT>I was not aware of that! That is interesting! Much cheaper than having to buy a lawyer! I do know there are more libraries than there are McDonald's in the US and that's a huge plus considering libraries are much more beneficial to us than Mickey D's!</UTT>That's crazy</UTT>I've always enjoyed libraries. But there's a library in Sacramento that actually allows you to check out useful stuff like sewing machines for temporary use that I've wanted to check out.</UTT>Wow that's pretty cool.</UTT>Libraries are certainly beneficial to those of us who love reading. Are you a fan of reading? I've been wanting to check out the book Starship Troopers as it's the first official sci-fi book on the reading lists of three of the US military branches!</UTT>Yes they are. Did you know starship troopers is the first sci-fi novel on the reading list of the US military?</UTT>I did and that's one of the reasons I want to read it to be honest! Of course, one day I'd like to beat Anne Jones' record reading speed of 4700 words per minute. Lol Realistically, that'll never happen with me but one can dream! Ha!</UTT>Haha that would be cool to beat that record!</UTT>Indeed! It would be difficult though as the reading process requires continuous practice, development as well as refinement!</UTT>For sure! I saw there was a moral panic in the 18th century due to the spread of reading novels. LOL</UTT>Wow! That's hard to believe! Wonder why? I bet CS Lewis and Tolkien had a good laugh about that during their "You laugh, you lose" competition.</UTT>LOL yea I bet they did have a good laugh about that.</UTT>Speaking of humor, I always enjoyed Mark Twain's humor. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn had some funny moments in it!</UTT>Yes it did. Did you know Nikola Tesla and Mark Twain were best friends?</UTT>Really? That is so cool. I did not know that actually? I do know Edison filmed the only footage on record of Twain. I've always wanted to see it. Would be cool if he had footage of Tesla and Twain together!</UTT>That would be cool. Did you know Thomas Edison filmed the only known footage of Mark Twain?</UTT>Yeah I did know about that and it's weird, isn't it? Twain had so many funny quips and statements. He once said cherimoya was the most delicious fruit known to man. Truer words have never been spoken! Ha!</UTT>Very weird. Interesting!</UTT>He also coined the word "gullible" which is a word I enjoy using. He used it to describe Tom Sawyer's buddies who were tricked into painting a fence!</UTT>Good talking to you!
t_f07ba1c7-8b6d-4d03-851d-7db428a8cb90</CONV>hey there what are some Celebrities that you like?</UTT>Hello! I'm a fan of Sylvester Stallone ever since seeing Rocky. Funnily enough, I heard there was a recent hoax he was dead!</UTT>oh wow ya I hope not, he's a great guy and its good he didn't have prostate cancer!</UTT>It's sad people spread a hoax like that, but celebrities have weird associations with fans. I remember a dude named Justin Bieber was banned on Facebook because he wasn't the celebrity.</UTT>ah that is true, its funny that they had to go to his brother Frank Stallone to confirm though</UTT>Oh for sure, best to find the most reliable source possible though. Who's the most overrated celebrity you know of?</UTT>hmm I think I would say Jennifer Lawerence, I don't think she's a good actress and I don't see any appeal to her, you?</UTT>I can see so! I think Paris Hilton, I don't really see what she does particularly well. She actually was in the guiness book of world records for most overrated celebrity.</UTT>nope I'd agree with Paris hilton too, I don't see her appeal, do you know who Carol Burnett was?</UTT>I think I've heard of her but don't know too much. Who is she?</UTT>she had a variety show in the 70's, but she was actually the first guest on Sesame street</UTT>Oh wow, that must have boosted her career for sure! It's interesting how people start out, like Jenna Marble is a celebrity just from making YouTube videos.</UTT>ya the internet is so awesome, crazy to think that you can get 3g service on mount everest</UTT>It's crazy how many areas have better service than it feels I do in general haha. I think even the ISS has faster Internet than most people have.</UTT>haha it wouldn't surprise me, did you know that there is an addiction you can get from clicking links? I think I have that haha</UTT>That's scary honestly, probably how celebrity hoaxes get started in the first place, people just love clicking and sharing everything they see.</UTT>ya I coul dsee that, also scary is that only 7% of people read internet terms of service</UTT>It makes sense when you think about it actually, we're actually the minority on the Internet technically, and we're outnumbered by software programs, it's scary to think.</UTT>yup that is scary, good thing there is a place that makes backups of the internet every day, jsut in case it ever goes down</UTT>Can't imagine how much work that takes too, at least no matter what places like Finland will always guarantee everyone the right to Internet.</UTT>ya, have you ever seen that button with 3 horizontal lines, its called a hamburger button, that makes me hungry haha
t_c61c07a9-da11-4f95-bdaf-ad502cdd7d4b</CONV>Are you interested in the study of the universe/space?</UTT>On a macular level, yes.  But, I tend to not enjoy the sub-atomic conversations.  I much prefer the big picture of how it was formed.</UTT>so do you know some of these fun facts that are listed? Like that some stars are cold to the human touch?</UTT>Yes, I knew that one.  Although, it would be impossible to actually touch given the gravity of the star.</UTT>that's true. since you know a bit more than I, what other facts can you share about the universe?</UTT>I know that even though technology continues to increase, it will never be possible to see further than 1/2 way across the universe due to expansion</UTT>that's pretty crazy</UTT>This tends to be considered a part of the unobservable universe.  We know it's there, but we can never detect it.</UTT>i didn't mean to send that message so soon! I was about to ask you if you knew some of these fun facts, like GM used to give astronauts corvettes when they returned from space!</UTT>Ah, yeah, I had heard that at some point.  It was probably a good advertising campaign given the correlation of the cars to the NASA program name designations.</UTT>what's an example of one of the cars/names? I'm not aware of this</UTT>The Mercury is the most known.  The Mercury program was the first NASA manned program.</UTT>oh! I guess that is a car brand. are there any others that come to mind?</UTT>Not offhand, no.  Although reading about it further, it seems they were just given Corvettes, so it may not have been such an advertising thing more than just being able to have the astronauts be seen with a new Corvette and use that as a status symbol.</UTT>true, and to show how elite those who traveled to space were</UTT>Personally, I'm not sure a new car would be worth the risk they took at the time.  Space is more of a passthrough, and not a destination.  I can't imagine having the military try and build stations for troop deployments in space.</UTT>i certainly can't either. and anything dealing with space travel feels way too risky to me still</UTT>The whole "nobody can hear you scream" concept bothers me a lot.  It's why they say astronauts can't whistle in space.  They can in their helmet, but no one outside it can hear it.</UTT>i guess that's why space food was invented too. well, the lack of gravity might have something to do with that too</UTT>I can only imagine the mess the first time food was attempted in space.  It was probably a bit of a surprise to have everything floating off uncontrollably.</UTT>haha yes it was! and i hope they didn't starve too much on that first adventure!
t_e663b604-613f-4b63-b04a-68f3df001120</CONV>Hello!  Hows it going?  Did you know Pixar has a room where only celebrities can go ?</UTT>That's cool. Did you know Robin Williams was actually who started the trend of celebrities performing in animated films to begin with?</UTT>He's amazing,  I still am not over him not being here anymore.  He was fantastic in Aladdin!</UTT>Absolutely. I miss Carol Burnett, too. She was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street!</UTT>That was a great show,  who was your favorite character?</UTT>Oh, I'm not sure. I haven't been interest in that show for decades. But speaking of nostalgia, did you know they're making a sequel to Space Jam?</UTT>Yeah i did,  with Lebron!</UTT>Yeah, he signed a contract with Warner Bros. and everything, so it seems official.</UTT>I hear he raised 6 mil for charity</UTT>He's a pretty impressive dude. He has a long list of awards and achievements.</UTT>Yeah seriously,  some of his high school basketball games would attract almost 2000 attendees!</UTT>Yeah, and they were able to charge over $100. For a high school game, that's insane!</UTT>That is crazy!  For a high school baseketball game!  I think at my highschool,  they charged $4 haha</UTT>Totally. He was also a decent businessman at that age; Reebok offered him a 10 million dollar contract, and he held out knowing he could make more.</UTT>Hes knows his worth, and he's probably been doing a lot of research!  Good for him!</UTT>Yeah, it definitely paid off. In less than a year, Nike offered him $90 million. NINETY! I bet Reebok felt stupid.</UTT>Yeah I know right,  they tried to low ball him.</UTT>I guess I sort of get it? He was only 18, so they had no idea what he'd become. But to be 18 and selling thousands of tickets for NBA prices, they should've known to invest in him.</UTT>Now hes is so wealthy,  I bet he has a lot of cars?  Do you like cars?</UTT>I do! I read the craziest thing the other day. I guess carjacking is so bad in South Africa, it is legitimately legal to equip flame-throwers to your car. How very Mad Max!</UTT>Thats really extreme!  Its been great chatting!  Have a good one.

Do you?</UTT>I listen to them every now and again. Did you know they partially funded monty python and the holy grail?</UTT>I didn't know that! That's awesome though! Do you know how "Black dog" got its name for a song?</UTT>It appears there was a dog wandering around the studio! Interesting, I never knew that! Speaking of recording songs, NWAs straight outta compton was the first album to reach platinum status without a major tour.</UTT>That is so cool. That means it was really good haha. Did you know Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is the best-selling album of the 21st century?</UTT>That's actually pretty surprising! Two twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100. It's never too late I guess.</UTT>Well said! I would love to hear it sometime haha. The Dark Side of the Moon was still one of the top albums in 2014, 40 years after release!</UTT>That's pretty awesome! Reel big fish had to rerecord all their hits for a best of album after losing the rights to their old record label. Ouch.</UTT>Well at least they could remember how the songs went haha. That is crazy how that could happen!</UTT>Yeah, that really sucks.When eddie van halen recorded the solo for beat it he set the speakers on fire!</UTT>That would have been a sight to see lol. He must have been rocking hard!</UTT>Yeah, that would have been insane! Queen's guitarist has a Ph.D. in astrophysics!</UTT>He looks smart haha. He uses coins as guitar picks too. That must take talent!</UTT>Yeah, he's a pretty interesting guy. Pink Floyd turned a house boat into a floating recording studio!</UTT>I wonder how that would be on the drums lol.</UTT>Muse's guitarist holds a record for most smashed guitars on tour!</UTT>I wonder how many! Well great chatting with you!</UTT>It was great chatting with you too!</UTT>Thanks! Have a good one!
t_f52deaea-e5ca-47d5-8f61-d74f449ebe0b</CONV>Hello! Do you like to travel?</UTT>I do like to travel. Air travel is up to 10% slower than it was in the 1960's in order to save on fuel costs.</UTT>I wonder how much fuel has gone up since then?</UTT>A great deal I'm sure. During the age of discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers.</UTT>That is nice that they thought of future generations. I have never tried rabbit.</UTT>Yes, it was nice of them. I think it is funny that people steal garden gnomes, take them traveling, and then return the gnome with photos back to the owner.</UTT>That is crazy! It in inconvenient to transport that while traveling.</UTT>Yes, it would be. I agree. I find it weird that there is a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling.</UTT>I guess if people are traveling on an extremely low budget that are willing to do that.</UTT>Yeah, I guess. Not me. Do you like to listen to the radio? I do. I love that we have radio's. There's even a radio station that translates solar activity into sound and you can listen live to the sun's music.</UTT>I wonder what the sun sounds like. I would assume it would put me to sleep.</UTT>I wonder if it would be energizing. In 1948 it was estimated that Bing Crosby recordings filled more than half of allocated radio time.</UTT>Wow! I would like to listen to jupiter's radio storms.</UTT>Yeah, I wonder what they sound like! So I like to watch TV too. I especially like Fox news. Hard to believe they threatened to sue the Simpsons in order to stop them from parodying its famously anti-democratic party agenda.</UTT>I think the simpsons is harmless comedy.</UTT>Yes. Did you know the median viewer age for Fox news was 68 years old?</UTT>I believe it. It attracts an older generation.</UTT>I would say so. Maybe its because the percentage of airtime on Fox news dedicated to opinion is 55%. For MSNBC its 85%.</UTT>I wonder why those percentages?</UTT>That I am not sure of. I'll have to look into it. It was nice chatting with you.</UTT>You too
t_47219914-d5a7-420e-adf4-694d235ad715</CONV>Hi, do you like to watch TV?</UTT>I watch TV from time to time. I like The Simpsons and I also like South Park. What about you?</UTT>I like both of those shows, which one is your favorite?</UTT>I would say that South Park is better than the Simpsons at this point. I like the early episodes of The Simpsons, but I don't think it's as good anymore. What about you??</UTT>I tend to agree. I liked the earlier episodes when Conan was writing for them.</UTT>Did you ever watch the show Pokemon? I liked that show a lot back in the day, I don't like the new Pokemon that they have now though, although I haven't seen any new episodes</UTT>I don't, but I've played the game Pokemon go. Did you play it?</UTT>I did play that game. I played red and blue back in the day haha. Which ones did you play? I know that I haven't played any of the most recent ones though</UTT>I just played POkemon Go. Did you know that there was a UK version of That 70s show?</UTT>Yes I think I heard about that, I think it was canceled right? After only like 10 episodes? I wonder if their humor is a lot different than ours, or if that show was just bad LOL</UTT>It was canceled afte 10 episodes, apparently it was not successful.</UTT>Haha I have to check that out, do you ever go on Facebook by the way? I don't really use it much anymore myself</UTT>I don't use it nearly as much as I did when i was younger. Apparently BK gave out a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people you get a free whopper.</UTT>I heard about that. I wish they had it now. I'm really hungry LOL, did you ever use MySpace by the way? Apparently they had an opportunity to buy Facebook at one point</UTT>No, I never got into myspace. But I heard they had a chance to buy facebook. Problem is that it is unlikely that facebook would be the same it is today had they bought them.</UTT>No you're right. I know that they could have bought them for only 75 million dollars, and the current valuation is at least a hundred billion dollars, but they would have run them differently. It might not have become as big as it did</UTT>Yeah. Did you know it  is blue because Zuck can't see red or green?</UTT>No I didn't know that. It makes a lot of sense though, I wonder why they didn't put that in The Social Network movie LOL. Did you hear about Iceland rewriting their Constitution by the way?</UTT>No, what for? Facebook?</UTT>Well they're rewriting their constitution, but they're doing it on Facebook apparently, so that way everyone can make suggestions or alterations on it, I don't really know how that works? What if people make bad decisions when they're making it LOL</UTT>That would be hilarious! Well, nice chatting with you.
t_dea696e2-523e-47b2-b6a8-6ca98391fd3b</CONV>Hello. Do you do much traveling?</UTT>I do, I love to travel. Though I don't think I could do that bus in the Netherlands designed to travel 160 mph.</UTT>I couldn't even imagine going that fast in a bus. It would be so scary. I'll stick with Mackinac Island where it is all horses or bikes.</UTT>Oh yeah, that's more my speed! I can't believe that's been going on in Michigan for over one hundred years!</UTT>That's really neat though. It shows respect for tradition instead of just trying to make everything bigger and faster like with some mass transit systems.</UTT>Iceland also doesn't have a public rail service.</UTT>I could see why they wouldn't need one. They have quite a few flights between most towns and travel that way. I don't think most of them have cars either.</UTT>Could you imagine living in Japan where all of the highways are tolls? It's getting to be like that in most of North America, practically.</UTT>If it means that all the roads are well maintained then I'm all for it. Some of the roads around here get just gnarly by the time the winter is over. It could be a good way to raise revenue.</UTT>That's true, but it costs $300 in tolls just to cross Japan and Japan is much smaller in comparison. It could make traveling pretty expensive.</UTT>It really could. I would probably start living vicariously through those travel shows that are all over netflix and prime.</UTT>I already do that! I'm a huge fan of Amazon. I can't believe it's been around for over twenty years now.</UTT>That does seem just crazy. I remember back in college being able to order just books on amazon. Now I can get just about anything delivered to my house.</UTT>In just a matter of a couple of hours! Did you know IMDB has owned Amazon.com since 1998?</UTT>Huh that actually explains one the prime movie features. If you click down when you are watching a movie it will give you the IMBD profile of everyone in that particular scene.</UTT>All about that synergy! Amazon also has a brand called AmazonBasics that sells knock off versions of products like light bulbs.</UTT>That is pretty neat. I like off brand stuff. It is always just as good and about half the cost. I wonder if that accounts for a lot of their new sunday deliveries.</UTT>I can't believe they got a contract with the USPS to deliver on Sundays! Hopefully, they're getting paid well, but at least it created jobs.</UTT>It seems liek amazon is doing a really good job of that. Particularly in their warehouses. The workers there not only get a job but stay super healthy with all the walking they do.</UTT>I'm not sure if they're paid very well to walk 10 miles a day, but maybe a lot of people enjoy it. You could eat practically whatever you want with that lifestyle! You'd need to!</UTT>Totally. I guess they could use their prime whole foods discount for some good food. Well it has been nice chatting with you. Have a good evening.</UTT>You too!
t_13832960-ad64-4d56-8ac2-f76613639e6e</CONV>Hi there! Do you like watching the NBA?</UTT>I watch a bit here any there.  I am really excited for March Madness though.</UTT>Yeah same here. Do you have a favorite college team you're cheering for?</UTT>I have to go with one of my Alma Maters, FSU.  the other can maybe identify a basketball 2/3 of the time.  Lol</UTT>Haha yeah my alma mater is Michigan so going for them but the season is always exciting. Do you ever play basketball?</UTT>I would play for fun, but I havent been blessed with height so Im not prime basketball material.</UTT>I agree haha. Are you a fan of Lebron?</UTT>I cant say that I am.  He is talented, for sure.  I am just not a fan of the team jumping he did.</UTT>I see. Given the state of the NBA today I wouldn't see it as a huge issue. I am a little biased though being a Lakers fan.</UTT>I understand that.  Did you know his high school games would often have tickets for $100?</UTT>I didn't know that. That is a crazy amount for a high school game in my opinion. Did you know Lebron signed a new deal for the next Space Jam?</UTT>Yeah!  The first one was so Iconic.  I grew up with it so I hope this next one can live up the the hype.</UTT>Honestly one of the best movies of all time! Have you ever gone to an NBA game?</UTT>I havent.  Im from Florida, so it isnt as big here, unless you were in Miami when Lebron was there.</UTT>Ah gotcha. Did you see Dwayne Wade's shot last night against the Warriors?</UTT>No, I didnt catch that one.  Tell me about it.</UTT>He hit a circus-shot buzzer beater against the Champs to win the game. Very happy for him considering it's his last season.</UTT>That is awesome!</UTT>It is! Did you know Tim Duncan stayed at college for 4 years instead of going straight to the NBA?</UTT>That is a smart move 60% of players go broke 5 years after retirement.</UTT>Yeah they are not very responsible with their money at all. It was great talking to you man - have a good one!</UTT>You too!
t_cd1e6055-2a57-43a1-8bb4-de122c8caaf0</CONV>hey there, do you know much about earth?</UTT>I know a little I guess. How about you.</UTT>some things yes, I used to take astronomy in high school. sadly, i know that over 80% of the forests have been destroyed</UTT>Dang thats not good. ouple that with the earth being 71 percent water and it feels like we are running out of forest.</UTT>exactly. and when earth was formed the day only had 5.5 hours. imagine that</UTT>That would be crazy. I know there is a part of Alaska where it is darke all day. I would not want to live like that. I like the sun. Speaking of the sun did you know that the earth is almost 4x as desnse as the sun is.</UTT>wow that is something. Nowadays we complain that 12 or more hours of daylight are not enough, imagine if we lived at that time</UTT>I know right. That would be miserable. Plus how would you grow food or anything. It really makes you think.</UTT>exactly. how do you feel about extraterrestrials?</UTT>I have never seen one. Idont know if I believe in them or not, honestly. I mean the Universe is all of space and time and their contents combined, so its pretty big. It would be hard to believe that there is no other intelligent life out there anywhere.</UTT>Yeah I guess that is why the UN appointed an abassador for that</UTT>I didnt know they did. Lol. Its funny how we went from ave men to where we are now in the world. We have radio and tv and computeers and internet. I think we may be the most intelligent out there in the universe.</UTT>it is a big universe that is for sure so I don't know. There are so many theories about the universe</UTT>Thats true. Did you know that early models of the Universe had the earth in the center. That has definitely been proven wrong.</UTT>another theory is that the universe is one super giant hologram</UTT>Im not sure if I believe that one.</UTT>yeah. another one is that the universes evolve through natural selection.</UTT>Is that the same as survival of the fittest. I believe that one.</UTT>I guess it makes the most sense. There are also some start in the universe that are cold enough for us to touch them</UTT>Wow thats interesting. I heard there is a cold spot in the cosmic microwave that has been theorized to be a link to a parrellel universe.</UTT>the universe is full of mystery. nice chatting with you.
t_f41e253b-ef43-48df-8895-a9f124f1edbe</CONV>Hello there, are you a fan of baseball?</UTT>Yes.  I was an assistant scout for the Phillies years ago.  Did you know that a married couple scheduled all 2430 games for 24 years until 2005?</UTT>Wow, that is pretty cool.  And no I didn't know that but that is very interesting.  I wonder how they ever got that job?</UTT>I don't know, but it must be complicated since there are sometimes concerts and other uses of stadiums.  Also, it's too cold in some ballparks early in the season.  There is a form of baseball played with a kickball in Canada.</UTT>Yeah that is true, the weather is unpredictable and some stadiums don't have roofs.  Yeah I think it is called soccer-baseball or something like that.</UTT>It is odd that managers wear baseball uniforms.  Coaches in other sports don't wear uniforms.</UTT>Yeah it is odd, but do you know why they might wear uniforms unlike other sports?</UTT>I have read that they can actually enter the game but I am not sure that I believe it.</UTT>Yeah that is right, technically they can play if they need to.  Wouldn't that be fun to watch your team's manager play and bat.</UTT>Some would do well because they were recently players, but sometimes they are over 60 years old.  Some of Japan's baseball fans are surprised that it is such a big deal in the US.</UTT>Yeah I know Japanese people are really into baseball.  Did you watch the world series this year?</UTT>Yes.  The American League champ plays the National League champ and the NL is not doing so well lately.</UTT>Yeah my team was one game away from representing the NL in the series.  Did you know that Babe Ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 of the series way back in 1926?</UTT>That was not a good baseball decision trying to steal that base.</UTT>No that doesn't sound like it.  But I think he made up for it quite a bit.  Do you know who the first team to win back to back world series was?</UTT>Yes.  The Cubs.  The last time they won, the Ottoman Empire still existed.</UTT>Yeah good call.  Are you a fan of the Cubs at all?</UTT>I do like them.  Their stadium is so old and so classic.  I guess what I said about the Ottoman Empire was wrong.  They won in 2016 also.</UTT>Yeah they did, maybe that was the last time they won their back to back series.</UTT>I live in Phoenix and the Diamondbacks won in 2001.  I could not imagine going 108 years without winning like the Cubs did.</UTT>Yeah our manager was a hero for you in that final game back then.  Well I haven't seen one in my lifetime I am ready!  It was nice talking with you.
t_d785cc77-ac9e-443f-984a-37270c32de0d</CONV>Hi, how are you? Do you use Facebook?</UTT>Yes, I use Facebook everyday. How about you?</UTT>I don't use it. Too many privacy concerns. How long have you used it?</UTT>I've been on Facebook since around 2004 when it started. I knew about right away because I was in college at the time and all the college kids knew about it.  Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum were among the first people who worked on developing Facebook.</UTT>I guess it was a good way to make friends and get to know about each other's lives. It's funny that  Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million in early 2005</UTT>Yes, MySpace was also out there at the same time Facebook was being developed on Zuckerberg had a better use of technology.  Facebook's name came from the face book directories of American university students.</UTT>Burger king had a promotion where if you unfriend 10 people on Facebook you get a free whopper. I wonder how many people took part in it.</UTT>Probably everyone who wanted a free Burger King Whopper!   Another fun fact is that Facebook is primarily blue because Zuckerburg suffers from red-green color blindness.</UTT>I guess he thought his needs were more important than user preference. Facebook gets used some interesting ways these day, too.</UTT>Yes, it's connected to lots of applications out in cyber world.  Did you  hear that Iceland is rewriting its constitution via Facebook?</UTT>I can't see anything possibly going wrong with that. Like hackers taking over the process.</UTT>It sounds like a Wikipedia kind of thing to me because Iceland is allowing the public to make suggestions and alterations.</UTT>I would hope that nothing goes wrong, like opinions getting erased or votes getting distorted.</UTT>I'm not sure what people in other countries think or do for that matter.  Did you know that Facebook's 'like' button is illegal in the German state of Schleswigholstein?</UTT>I think the Germans do not like expressing favor or preference. Maybe there should be a dislike or hate button.</UTT>Yes like a rating scale? That would be a thought. Facebook wouldn't do that because they make most of their revenue from advertisements that appear on the screen and hate buttons would end that positiveness.</UTT>Under normal circumstances, but perhaps in Germany everything is backwards. LOL</UTT>That could be the case but maybe not. Depending on local cultural meaning that thumbs up could mean something else to the German people.</UTT>Maybe the Germans do better with unfriending for Whoppers. Anyway, thanks for the chat!</UTT>Yes, lots of different social media have a stake in Facebook.  I use it to keep up with what's going on. Yes, it's been real chatting with you as well.</UTT>Have a good night!</UTT>You as well.</UTT>Thanks! Hit the DONE button please.</UTT>Yes, I did on the last response.
t_f15a630f-74dc-4c65-be48-c41eb1add6b9</CONV>Did You see Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey?</UTT>I have not seen it in its entirety, but I have seen clips.  It looks intriguing.</UTT>it is ! Kubrick wanted 90 tons of sand dyed gray for 2001 and that was just the start.</UTT>From what I have read, Kubrick was way ahead of his time as a film maker.  It's amazing that his futuristic vision was created so vividly over 40 years ago.</UTT>YES ! Imagination on that guy had no limits. Obviously, some viewers didn't know what hit 'em, or that they were witnessing a significant moment in filmmaking.</UTT>It's no surprise that tons of people left early from the film's premier.  It had to be so foreign to them.  In retrospect, many had to appreciated the originality and vision, no doubt.</UTT>It's one of those movies that You appreciate more in time. ...oh, and the soundtrack was legendary 1 ;)</UTT>The film has definitely become a part of our culture.  There are so many references to it in others films, tv, video games, etc.</UTT>You're so right ! Hey did You know that Ringo starr, george carlin, and alec baldwin have all narrated thomas the tank engine for at least 52 episodes each ?</UTT>I didn't know that, but it's interesting and humorous.  George Carlin narrating a children's show.  If the children only knew...</UTT>lol, I remember my son when he was 2 - he was obsessed with Thomas... to me it was so annoying ;) "oh no, trouble on the tracks" ! ;)</UTT>It would have been more entertaining for you if Carlin had used a few of his seven words you can't say on television, no doubt.  But not appropriate for the kids, I know.</UTT>oh come on ;) he should do it, kids wouldn't understand anyway ;) I think... ;)</UTT>The FCC would have had a field day with that.  And think of the questions the kids would ask afterward.  Those might be a bit awkward.</UTT>lol ;) they would grow up much quicker ! You're welcome kids ! ;)</UTT>Indeed, they would!  That's a funny thought.  They'd be ready to transition into cartoons like Family Guy and South Park more quickly.  As an adult, I enjoy SP probably more than I should.</UTT>oh yeah, South Park is great. I mean back then it was not as Politically Correct as now... they not as controversial as they once were. Still funny though ;)</UTT>Yes, the new seasons have been ok, but older episodes like Whale Wars and Cartman's Incredible Gift still crack me up.  Such good satire.</UTT>Yes ! People that don't follow SP think it's just a silly, rude cartoon. They don't realize every episode is about some popular real time current event. Great idea for a show ;)</UTT>So true!! The creators are much like Jonathan Swift or Voltaire in their satirization of modern times.  They take on politics, pop culture, education, religion, science, you name it.</UTT>Yup ;)  with awesome portion of good level humor ;) Family Guy is a little different but I love it too ;)</UTT>You're right.  Family Guy does deserve some accolades as well.  And you can't forget the Simpsons.  Back in the day, that was my go to show; it was clever and and funny as well.</UTT>When Simpsons started I was still living in Poland and I didn't understand most jokes so I stopped watching :) maybe now it's time to go back to that show ;)</UTT>Oh, wow.  You lived in Poland.  Very cool.  I can see where some allusions might have been difficult.  I haven't watch in years, so maybe it is time to return.</UTT>Yeah, I was born there, now I live in NY. ...but You know, shows like South Park, Simpsons or Family Guy ( and many many others ) kind of prepared me to what was waiting for me in this country. I knew more or less what to expect and it helped me with my English ;) fun ride it was...</UTT>Well, it has been a pleasure conversing with you.  I have enjoyed it a great deal.   Happy New Year to you from Nebraska!
t_57a854a0-2325-4fdf-aabd-0d1262798a58</CONV>Do you like watching dramas?</UTT>Hi there, I actually do. I love watching House MD</UTT>I used to watch that. Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor for tv drama ever.</UTT>Yeah the guy used to make $700 000 per episode, that is insane</UTT>Jim Carrey doesn't act in dramas anymore. I thought it was just because he did better in comedy.</UTT>Well he is good in comedy but apparently he does not do dramas because they do not convey positivity</UTT>Michael Caine is another successful actor. But he only became an actor because all the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class.</UTT>Wow, I guess he knew what he was after. Patrick Steward also is a great actor and teaches drama class in the UK</UTT>If you're really into drama, there is a website where you can listen to episodes of classic dramas at no cost.</UTT>Oh that is nice that is good to know. Do you know how the term soap opera originated?</UTT>I'm not sure. How?</UTT>The dramas were sponsored by manufacturers of soap so they ended up with that name</UTT>Oh yes I vaguely remember now. Speaking of something that seems surreal, kind of like out of a drama, NFL wide receiver Steve Smith leaves his cleats on the field after every game. This raises awareness about homeless people who do not have shoes.</UTT>That is amazing that he does that, we can all contribute in our own way. Did you know Bill Nye actually holds a patent for ballet shoes, the pointe ones?</UTT>Ha. No, that sounds odd. Speaking of pointe shoes, professional ballet dancers can go through four pairs a week.</UTT>that is a lot of shoes. Do you know how many ways are there to tie shoes?</UTT>I don't know but probably a lot! Speaking of shoes, they were way better 5000 years ago than they are now!</UTT>Yeah they were certainly more durable back in the day. We need to figure out that secret</UTT>Stephon Marbury promoted $15 shoes and didn't get paid to endorse them. I wonder how durable they were though.</UTT>Yeah they seem pretty cheap. Queen Elizabeth employs people to wear her shoes to make sure they are comfy</UTT>Ha, that sounds very odd. You can put dry tea bags in smelly shoes to get rid of bad smells.
t_9e1f26e9-844a-4814-a335-62458e4f307a</CONV>Do you enjoy listening to the radio?</UTT>I really do. What about you?</UTT>I listen to the radio in the car frequently. Did you know that you can pick up Jupiter's radio storms on an AM radio because they are so strong?</UTT>That would be quite the experience to have driving down the road surfing channels and suddenly there is a storm being broadcast.</UTT>That would be crazy but also interesting. Did you also know that you can make a radio with very rudimentary tools?</UTT>Soldiers in WW2 used to make them out of just a pencil and razor blade. Seems like a skill that could come in handy.</UTT>I would imagine that would come in very handy, especially during war. Have you ever listened to any of the old radio dramas that used to be very popular?</UTT>No but they sound fascinating. I think the programs back then had such rich imagery for people to be entertained by since TV wasn't as popular.</UTT>Absolutely, people would gather around to listen to them. Did you know that there is a website where you can listen to them for free? I wonder if they hold up.</UTT>I think they probably would. I imagine that War of the Worlds and ones like that will always stand the test of time.</UTT>I would like to listen to that one. I also learned that in Canada by law the music played must be at least 40% Canadian. What a strange law.</UTT>Kind of cool though to have that national pride though. I wonder what they consider canadian radio. Maybe they do a french station.</UTT>Possibly. Maybe depending on the region of Canada.Off topic but do you find sharks to be interesting?</UTT>I find them fascinating. They seem like such scary creatures but they actually rescue people!</UTT>I had heard that. Did you know that they do not have rib cages?</UTT>That is why they die so quick on land right? I heard they can be trained. Who would want to train a shark!?</UTT>Partially, yes. Their weight can crush them on land because of the lack of a rib cage. I had also heard they can be trained. I heard that they can even be trained to bark!</UTT>I think that would freak me out more than just seeing a shark. Imagine being somewhere and a shark comes up and starts barking!</UTT>That would be insanely surprising. I would have no idea what to do. Were you also aware that sharks evolved before dinosaurs or trees?</UTT>There seem to be so many different kinds. They are just a fascinating predator.</UTT>I agree. They are very interesting. They even congregate in the middle of the ocean.
t_136a8c8c-f4d7-4847-b877-e2080829f961</CONV>hey hows it going?</UTT>Im good I was reading about how these three men got arrested trying to breach the white house.</UTT>ya that is crazy, did you know the white house has twin buildings in ireland and france? like are they exactly the same I assume? never heard of that</UTT>You know i have heard that. If i recall the oval office desk has a twin as well somewhere.</UTT>huh that is more than I knew, and I didn't know the white house still uses floppy discs to store files, seems very backwards to me</UTT>Im not sure that is true lol. But yeah turns out those three guys were unrelated  and all tried to break in on the same night lol.</UTT>lol that is wild, I don't know what they were thinking.</UTT>Oh yeah one guy was really not well, he told the arresting officer "that God asked him to change the world".</UTT>ya, its also weird that trump isn't one of the top 3 most wealthy presidents, but this is probably taking inflation into account so taht explains it somewhat</UTT>Yeah I wonder who the richest were? I think Jefferson was rich. But get this, One of the other guys who tried to break in had a Yorkshire terrier on him and two book bags filled with clothes.</UTT>oh wow, like I guess, I just don't know what he could be planning with all that, that poor doggo that was with him haha</UTT>Yeah it is so strange. I dont get why people would even try to break in there you know that its got guards everywere.</UTT>ya you know you're gonna get caught, and your life will be ruined, this says the presidents guest house is bigger than the white house itself, that doesnt make sense but I guess</UTT>I think they have mental issues because the guy who said he was sent by god promised that he would keep trying to get in lol</UTT>how worrisome. this says the president of indonesia released 3 pop albums while in office, that sounds kind of awesome!</UTT>That is funny I wonder if they are any good. i have heard the first phone number of the white house was "1"</UTT>haha that makes sense, did you know that kickball is called soccer-baseball in canada? thats a mouthful</UTT>I had no idea but they come up with all kinds of interesting things.</UTT>haha they have them mind clouded by the cold maybe haha, and baseball being popular in japan is always weird to me</UTT>I have heard that A 17 year old female pitcher was banned from professional baseball after she struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig in succession..</UTT>wow weird I wonder why I've never heard that before, it seems like a fact poeple would like to know, I wish I were the guy that found 3 million dollars worth of baseballs cards in his grandfathers attic</UTT>I never collected those. I read that The chicago cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series; and haven't won since. i wonder how close they have gotten?</UTT>ya I think they're cursed or something?

I have been a Bulls fan since the days of Michael Jordan.</UTT>I see, Jordan was a great player indeed, one of the best of all time, well the Wizards started out slow loosing against the Toronto Raptors.</UTT>But they seemed to keep in it, they were only a few points behind.  Plus the Raptors are 1st seed in their division.</UTT>Yeah it was a close game, I hope they can do better on other games, it would be a shame if they didnt had a good season</UTT>Isn't the next game coming up this Friday?</UTT>I think they are playing tomorrow actually against the Bucks, we lost the last game against them so hopefully we can do better this tiem</UTT>Well best of luck to them, maybe if they started shooting "granny style" for those free throws they could score some extra points, physicists actually proved it is the best technique, even though it looks kind of stupid.</UTT>Yeah I think they could improve but players refuse to do it for that same reason, it looks stupid although I dont care as long as my team wings</UTT>Definitely, whatever gets those points on the board.  Kind of like the 105 points Cheryl Miller once scored in a game.  That's crazy, sometimes teams dont even score that many.</UTT>He did? wow, thats a whole lot of points for one player in one game I wonder if he shoot granny style lol</UTT>Maybe, that would be how I'd have to get it done.  Basketball is far from my sport.</UTT>Ok so if you are a basketball fan then you definetly know who Allen Iverson is?</UTT>I do.  I heard he has some crazy endorsement with Reebok.</UTT>He does, he recieves $800.000 a year and then when he turns 55 he will receive a big payment of $32.000.000</UTT>I'd be good with just $800,000 for life.   They could throw some free shoes in too.  Lol.</UTT>I agree lol, its crazy how big companies can offer players deals like that one, or like Nike when they didnt care about the fine of the air Jordans</UTT>Sometimes they are playing the long game, companies that is.  Look at how many pairs of Air Jordans they have sold over the years, just for a few years of fines.  I mean they are still current and popular shoes, and thats like a 20 year run on it.</UTT>I agree and I guess a company like Nike can afford it, after all they offer million dollar deals to a lot of players.</UTT>There are also those players who sacrifice money for their own betterment, like Tim Duncan who stayed in college instead of going straight to the NBA.</UTT>I think the decision Tim Duncan made was the right one, he lost a lot of money but many players end up bankrupt after their carreers are over
t_bfcdda6a-6213-4b51-8270-160a562e91d3</CONV>Hi, how are you? Do you think Donald Trump has had any effect on the arts?</UTT>Well that is a very interesting question! I do think people have probably crafted their arts differently based on their political views, whether it be musically or creatively. Do you agree?</UTT>I think so. I think writers, or poets, for example are finding themselves writing a lot darker than usual.</UTT>I agree. I didn't even realize political poetry was a thing, but apparently it is, so I'm sure how the author perceives the political climate affects their writing. That must be like a rollercoaster based on who is elected!</UTT>I'm sure Trump, whether you love or hate him, is a constant source for inspiration, even up to the point of right before the artist goes on stage.</UTT>That is so true. Have you ever heard any spoken word poetry in person?</UTT>Nope, have you? I think it would be cool to see something like Demetri Martin's 224 word palindrome performed live.</UTT>I haven't either. Oh my gosh, Demetri Martin is hilarious. I've seen the video of that palindrome poem but never live. I think it's cool that poetry has been around since the 25th century BCE. It has evolved so much!</UTT>I know, right? I wonder what Edgar Allan Poe would think if he knew how many students read "The Raven" after he only received $9 for the publication of it.</UTT>Oh man, so true. I know there's some poem that was written that when you read it forward, it's very depressing but when you read it backwards it's inspiring. I think I read it one time.</UTT>What's also interesting is written poetry probably lead to lyrics and song. Thanks to that we have a lot of great albums in the 1900's and early 2000's.</UTT>Yeah, I don't care much for poetry but I absolutely love music. I know they're really tied together though. I love the old vinyls that came about in the 1940s, 1950s. I know we've since gone through audio cassettes and CDs and MP3s, but I think vinyl records are actually making a comeback.</UTT>I actually collect Vinyl's. I have a huge digital collection, but if I really like something I'll buy the vinyl. I should get Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, that's missing from my collection.</UTT>I put my record player away when I had kids but now that they're older I've been thinking about pulling it back out so they can really appreciate some music. Our local libraries have tons of vinyls at great prices. It's funny that Dark Side of the Moon was actually a best-selling album just a few years ago even though it was released over 40 years ago!</UTT>I bet vinyl sales are way higher than CDs now. By me, you can find stores that sell only new and old vinyls. Great sound quality!</UTT>Oh I bet you are right! I didn't even think about new vinyls being created. Are people putting new stuff on both CDs and vinyls?</UTT>Yes, I just got the Foo Fighter's album Sonic Highways last year. Really cool album. But on Amazon you can find any new album on vinyl now.</UTT>I had no idea! I guess I know just as little information about all that as I do politics. Do you pay any attention to elections and such?</UTT>Yes, I do. The United States voter turnout is always so low, it's crazy. I love voting.</UTT>Same here. I may not keep up much with politics throughout the year but I try to educate myself at election time. Sometimes I wish my state was like Nevada, and I could check a "none of these candidates" box for presidential elections!</UTT>haha! you could always vote for yourself as a write-in!</UTT>That would be pretty funny to do! Nice chatting with you!</UTT>Same! Have a good night.</UTT>Thanks!
t_6e87c1d8-ecca-4469-9d7f-4263eaf105fd</CONV>Hello - how are you today?</UTT>I am doing great. How about you.</UTT>I'm doing good thanks for asking. Did you know Jupiter has radio storms that can be detected on Earth?</UTT>I didnt know that. Are you a space nut. I dont mean that negatively.</UTT>Nope not really. I like to learn about space from time to time, but would not consider myself a space nut. I saw that in Canada it's a law to have a least 40% of the music played on the radio to be Canadian.</UTT>Thats understandable I guess. Although I dont know why they would really worry to much about something like that.</UTT>Yea it seems like an odd law.</UTT>It really does. Continuing  with the radio theme of our conversation. Did you know that radios can be made using a razorblade and a pencil for the diode. I might try to make one.</UTT>Oh wow I did not know that. Pretty good idea though.</UTT>Yeah it is. They used to make them in WW2. They called them foxhole radios. I guess anything to get some peace of mind in a time like that.</UTT>That's pretty cool. Hopefully it kept them entertained.</UTT>Tue dat. On a lighter note there is a website where you can listen to thousands of classic radio dramas for free. That would be cool to hear what they listened to back in the day.</UTT>That's pretty cool they offer that for free. Do you like cars?</UTT>I like cars. I hate working on cars. Not saying I dont work on them, I do, I think thats why I hate it so much.</UTT>LOL. The trunk of your car is named that because the older cars actually had wooden trunks in them.</UTT>I had heard that before. I wonder what people from those days would think about the cars of today.</UTT>They would probably be pretty amazed at how much they've advanced.</UTT>Yeah just the amount of cars on the road would probably amaze them. With over 1.25 billion vehicles on the road in 2014.</UTT>That's a lot of vehicles. I saw in South Africa it's legal to hook up a flame thrower to your vehicle to prevent carjacking.</UTT>Yeah that would sure deter me from stealing a car.</UTT>Definitely. It was good talking to you!
t_60c37432-c9f8-4c45-830e-d89e95393250</CONV>Did you listen to Led Zeppelin?  There's a new book out about them.</UTT>I was not aware of that. Have you heard it?</UTT>It's a book.  They do have many good albums.  I remember Houses of the Holy the most.</UTT>I know they were hugely popular. They were a bit before my time. I do kind of like "stairway to Heaven".</UTT>That song got sooooo much airplay and some their best didn't.  This last book actually is actually from the remaining 3 members.</UTT>I enjoy books like that. It is interesting to get insight into great bands.</UTT>This one may be good.  It has a diverse set of photos from all kinds of sources.</UTT>Very cool. Have you ever tried to play the guitar?</UTT>I tried but I wanted to play well immediately and it made my finders hurt.  I'm no Jimmy Page...</UTT>I tried to learn many years ago. I just didn't have the patience. My daughter has taught herself the ukulele.</UTT>No patience here either... The guitarist from Queen uses coins for pick. Maybe that would have helped...</UTT>Have you seen "Bohemian Rhapsody"? I think it would be interesting.</UTT>No, but I used to be a Queen listener.  I don't know much about Linkin Park but they have the best selling album of the 21st century call "Hybrid Theory."</UTT>Growing up I was a little indifferent to Queen, but now I really like a lot of their stuff. Which band do you think is beater, Queen or Led Zeppelin?</UTT>Different styles but I'd go with Led Zeppelin since they were more prolific. They named the song "Black Dog" after a dog that hung around the studio.</UTT>Yeah, That is interesting. I guess naming a song can be a challenge.</UTT>Naming software is the same way... I'm surprised that Led Zeppelin helped fund Monty Python's "The Holy Grail"... Classic...</UTT>That is also interesting. Have you seen "The Holy Grail" lately?</UTT>It's been a while... I've seen it many times.  Funny, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992!</UTT>I prefer to watch that in scenes because the whole movie is a bit boring. Could you imagine raping when you are 100?</UTT>I can't imagine breathing when I'm 100. Thanks, you were a great chat partner!
t_cb8b47ff-8fe8-4045-a24c-971cc046cae5</CONV>Do you follow the NFL?  What do you think about their loss to the Giants?</UTT>I do watch the NFL. The NFC east is really competitive. It could have gone either way...</UTT>They gave up 200 yards and missed too many tackles.  They just didn't continue the momentum they had.</UTT>They missed out on a 3 game winning streak to finish the season. I do not like them so Im kinda glad...</UTT>That's too bad.  Do you know there is no rule against female players.</UTT>I did not. I think it would be scary to watch women play against some of the larger football players.</UTT>Surprisingly, though New Orleans Saints cheerleaders have to leave a diner if they see another NFL player in the restaurant.  Unfair standards.</UTT>Seems sexist. Maybe that's why they lost 2 weeks ago on a bad call... karma!</UTT>I'm glad for the yellow line though from ESPN.  It helps a lot on calls in football. They won an award Emmy for it.</UTT>When it first came out, I told my wife that people had to move it and that players have tripped on it. Im a bad person...</UTT>I wish I was at the game where 222 points was scored in football back in 1916.  That would have been a trip at Georgia tech.</UTT>You gotta pull the QB at 60-0, right? Speaking of emasculating, Iowa paints their visiting locker room pink.</UTT>Sounds like another intimidation factor.  Bowlers made more than top football stars in the 60's.  That's crazy!</UTT>That's odd! They don't make more than Elisha Manning!</UTT>How much does Elisha make?</UTT>Millions! He's the QB for the NY Giants football team.</UTT>His brother also plays and his dad played.</UTT>I feel bad for his older brother Cooper. He never played. Seems like he's the odd man out.</UTT>Eli Manning and Peyton both were number one drafts</UTT>Yes they were. I wonder where Archie was drafted?</UTT>I'm not sure, but Manning played for University of Mississippi 2000 to 2003 and was first pick for San Diego but immediately traded to the Giants.  Lucky for the Giants.</UTT>Nice chatting with you!
t_e8d77b79-c72e-45ed-8464-902c52a1f71e</CONV>Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment and current political news.</UTT>Indeed, but what do you think  about television personally ?</UTT>It's a mass entertainment medium, it attracts all ages, mostly children and kids are always watching it. It occupies most of their time.</UTT>Do you enjoy watching television ?</UTT>Some what. What about you ?</UTT>I enjoy watching television, mostly drama and comedy, some sketch show like SNL for time to time. DO you enjoy watching SNL ?</UTT>I enjoy watching serials. It's very interesting to know next details about it. Nowadays teenager are on mobiles, they have no time to watch it. In olden days football matches were watched on TV. Its very amazing.</UTT>Have you ever watched the Simpsons ? It is a very popular show, there are more 400 shows.</UTT>Yes, Do you like pokemon ? The serial has been run for more than 2 years.</UTT>I am too old for Pokemon, even when it first came out. What do you like about Pokemon ?</UTT>It is Japanese anime serial. It is based on nintendo's video game series.</UTT>So, you like video game based serial ? I prefer dramas, even old one like Shakespear's plays.</UTT>It's very funny. Which are your favourite plays?</UTT>I like Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare is so good that only one of his play has not been on film or on television: The two noble kinsmen. That is incredible.</UTT>It very amazing ! No words to describe it. It is all time favourite to many of the world.</UTT>Indeed. Do you like Shark Tank ? the show where people pitch business ideas to potential investors.</UTT>Earth is the third planet from the sun in the solar system. The gravity of the sun holds the entire solar system. Mostly all the planets revolves around the sun.</UTT>OK. If you like facts, I was surprised that the density of the Earth is 4 times of the Sun, which is surprising and not surprising since the Sun is a ball of gas.</UTT>Mostly 71% earth surface is covered with water remaining 29% is land. The entire polar region is covered with snow.</UTT>Would like to go in Antarctica ? I would, it is so remote.  It must be peaceful.</UTT>The place is not suitable for human to live.</UTT>But there are research bases there ? I bet, Billy Graham would go preach there if he was still alive. Bye
t_13ae25a3-40d3-426b-842a-4845aa3a6098</CONV>Hi, did you know the Zimbabwe's president was called president banana?</UTT>I do not think I would want to be a president known as president banana!</UTT>Haha, indeed, I grew up near St. Louis and didn't realize a neighboring community, Collinsville, IL had a law prohibiting "saggy pants", given my bad fashion in high school I might have broken that law there.</UTT>That is funny! I grew up in Southern California so we would have had the same problems if that were a law where I live.</UTT>I didn't realize the Romans thought only barbarians wore pants, yet as time moved on they were better for mounted armies on horses so pants replaced toga's. If you from Southern California you might have preferred toga's, darn horse soldiers. Did you know pants are underwear in UK vs lowerware here. Kind of like fries and chips UK vs. here.</UTT>It is like cookies and biscuits as well. I also did not realize that Aladdin's pants were modeled after MC Hammer. Both could be considered "saggy pants"</UTT>Yes, and illegal in Collinsville, IL. I will be forever haunted by mc hammer and that saggy pants video from MTV, one of those things you can't un-see. Did you see where a guy impersonated a French government official and twice sold the Eiffel Tower, now that a scam artist of epic proportion.</UTT>I will be haunted by those pants as well! A man twice sold the Eiffel Tower, that must have been a long time ago?!!</UTT>Well I think it was completed in the late 1880's, not terrible long ago, but yes before TV, radio and the internet. One wonders how he got the pictures and contracts together and sold the fools on that scam. You from California, did you know that the US Govt. own 86% of Nevada, from my trips to Vegas flying in there's a whole lot of nothing in Nevada.</UTT>You are correct, other then Vegas and the Hoover dam, it's a whole lot of nothing. Did you know that the white house guest house is larger than the white house? Now that house is in an area with a lot to see and do!</UTT>Yes, as I recall from my history classes being from the Midwest, Harry Truman was living in the guest house as the White House was being renovated and survived an assassination attempt. A lot to see and do, and a lot of history. If the President of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums in office, what genre do you think our current US President would release albums in if he took it in his head to release an album (Bill Clinton did play sax and Obama rapped a time or two)?</UTT>I think he would read one of his own books on tape and be a voice over artist. Haha! That would be really neat if one of our presidents released a pop album, no matter how good or bad it may be.</UTT>Yes, I agree with your assessment of the current occupant of the oval office's artistic genre, himself. He's claimed to overstate his wealth for Forbes and understate for the IRS, but did you know Washington and Jefferson were 2 of the 3 wealthiest Presidents (JFK being 3rd). Seems being a plantation owner must have been a pretty profitable gig...</UTT>I think so, it is funny though, that our current president is not listed as one of the wealthiest, you would definitely think he would be. It is kind of surprising that Washington was that wealthy.</UTT>Yes, and Washington free'd his slaves at death. I'm not sure if he had any kids to pass his wealth to, but that was pretty liberal for those days. It's also ironic Wikileaks published the governments plans to destroy Wikileaks; I guess it's good they weren't successful as they couldn't have published Hillary's emails had they been shut down. Who knew that would turn out to help Trump become president.</UTT>They are a surprising group, they clearly have no moral code or value for ethics or privacy. Apparently they also sent message to Roger Stone of an advance notice on the DNC email hack/dump.</UTT>Alas, I fear history won't treat the American electoral kindly for the cast of characters put put into the Executive Branch of our government in 2016. You'd think if Wikileaks was unbiased there a lot of files of Donald Trumps going's on that would have been a lot more juicy had the site treated both parties equally. It's odd to me the anti-globalist sentiment as the grandson of 2 WW II Vets, the UN and Nuremberg Courts and International Law was a US idea for world peace and in 2006 the US Govt. passed law protecting gov't employees from the very Geneva Convention we put forth in the first place. I think about it too much I want to disrepair, what are your thoughts?</UTT>I agree with you so far. Unfortunately for the entire world, wikileaks is incredibly biased and self serving. Did you know that in 2008 the norwegian government donated $1bn to help save the amazon rainforest? I wish our current government would take the environment that seriously!</UTT>yes, I agree there. I want to despair and then I read something like that and think, "There's hope!".</UTT>Same, this is a major issue for me. It is truly terrifying that according to scientists we only have 12 years to fix the irreversible damage that is being done to our planet.</UTT>Yes, I'm chemistry major and with a freshman level of understanding of the gas laws and CO2 you think we could craft sane policy regrading our children future, but like the US Government Debt we seem to have little concern for our grand kids and beyond. I'm going to think at MC Hammer's pants in closing, something absurd.</UTT>I think that is the perfect way to end this conversation, MC hammer and Aladdins pants! Good talking to you, nice to hear a like minded voice!</UTT>Cheers! Thanks for a pleasant and thoughtful conversation.</UTT>Cheers!

I know that Tupac Shakur has his music in the Library of Congress actually</UTT>Interesting, I might just visit it this summer and catch up on some of his tunes.</UTT>Yeah you should check it out. What do you think about the rapper Eminem by the way? I know I listened to him a lot in high school</UTT>Yeah, I was pretty big back in the day. I think he was good up until the last album.</UTT>I agree with you. What do you think about the judge who gave her judgment in the form of a rap to him, it seems like she has too much time on her hands in my opinion LOL</UTT>I didn't know that. What was it for?</UTT>I'm not sure what the case was for. But I know that he was involved, and she felt the need to give the ruling in rap form haha. I guess I should look it up on YouTube it might be funny</UTT>Interesting. Did you know we wanted to become a comic book artist before becoming a rapper?</UTT>No I didn't! That is interesting but I think he chose the right career haha. Do you like Busta Rhymes by the way? He did a voice in The Rugrats Movie I guess</UTT>Yeah, he was good in that song Scenario. I didn't know he was in the Rugrats movie though.</UTT>Yes I haven't seen that movie In Forever. Do you know what a compliment battle is? Two rappers just give compliments to each other, apparently it's really big in Korea</UTT>Interesting, sounds hilarious, but also very boring at the same time.</UTT>Yeah it wouldn't be funny, just a really nice thing to watch probably LOL perfect for the kids, do you watch Netflix by the way?</UTT>I do, but I just canceled my subscription. What about you?</UTT>No we don't have Netflix. I mostly just watch YouTube myself, we don't have cable either, I do like the show stranger things though I'll have to watch it at my friend's house when they come out with the new season haha.</UTT>I like youtube. Did you know though that from 9am-12pm netflix accounts for all of the bandwidth in North America?</UTT>No I didn't know that. I did know that YouTube and Netflix together make up about half of all internet traffic though. That's very impressive I think. I wonder if something else comes along, will we lose all of our internet bandwidth LOL</UTT>I can believe that. Did you know watching a horror movie can burn 180 calories?</UTT>I didn't know that! I need to do that after the last weekend haha I feel so fat. I didn't know to that Stephen King considers Bambi to be a horror movie haha I wonder if he burned the 200 calories watching it as a kid

That is a nice paycheck.  I didnt realize jim carrey doesnt do dramas anymore.</UTT>Yeah apparently they go against his belief system, I can respect that I like to keep a positive mindset as well.</UTT>yeah, plus he is amazing in comedy.</UTT>Yeah he sure is, do you like Ryan Stiles? do you know who he is?</UTT>Yes, hes on whose line is it anyways and the drew carrey show,  that tall guy is hilarious!  He is so good at improv.</UTT>He is great, I am a big fan of him, so funny, well seems like he didnt graduate from High School</UTT>Yeah he dropped out to pursue a career in comedy, crazy.</UTT>That could have ended so wrong, Im glad things worked out for him.</UTT>Yeah so young in high school its crazy to think you already knew what you wanted to do for the rest of your life.</UTT>School is important, I would finish high school at least, another famous actor who did something similar is Demetri Martin.</UTT>I guess law school can be pretty boring lol At least he finished high school lol</UTT>Yeah but still quitting Harvard law is a decision many would think a hundred times before making.</UTT>Good point.</UTT>I would finish law school and then pursue a comedy career, anyways its getting kind of late so its was good chatting with you</UTT>great chat, thanks! have a good one.

Jackson does?  He really loves golf to put it in his film contracts.Lol</UTT>It can get addicting, But, you have to play alot to stay on your game!</UTT>That's so true.  I read somewhere that golf courses in America make up more land space than Delaware and Rhode Island combined.</UTT>Yes, I am surprised there aren't a few more small states added. Golf can be good exercise if your walking.</UTT>On a different note, do you watch any television?</UTT>I use to, I am more on the internet now.</UTT>That's cool.  Do you know the current Library of Alexandria has a copy of the internet, in case it burns down?</UTT>I saw that, Lets hope it doesn't, lol we all wouldn't know what to do!</UTT>Lol, talk about being lost.  Do you realize that only 7% of people read the full terms when buying a product or service on the internet?</UTT>I believe that, they make them so long and hard to read. Good to know Mt.

I always thought it was interesting how many different types of football there are.</UTT>How many? I only know the one lol</UTT>There is Canadian Football, Austrailian football and other regional football sports</UTT>Thats interesting, is Rubgy like another version of the sport?</UTT>It is.  Rugby is a variation of football.  Also, of course soccer is called football in most parts of the world</UTT>I see, well do you like Amrican Football?</UTT>I do.  I follow college more than the NFL.  I was always a fan of the Navy Midshipmen.</UTT>I heard they had a hard time reaching the bowl</UTT>They have had a up and down history over the years.  I also followed Oaklahoma when Baker Mayfield was playing for them.  He is a good QB</UTT>He was a good QB I agree, didnt he want to quit football and become a pro video game player?</UTT>Yes, but I think he will make a lot more money in the NFL than he will playing Halo for a living!</UTT>Yeah, pro players get paid tons of money, do you know who Alex Smith is?</UTT>Yes I do.  He was drafted 1 overall back in 2005.  He has had a good career in pro football</UTT>He is also a smart man, he got his BA in 2 years and also has a masters degree</UTT>Yes, he took a lot of college leve courses in high school and it gave him a heads up on his education.  It is good to be smart when you are a QB</UTT>Then you can really manage your finances, many players tend to waste their money after they retire,</UTT>They do.  It is sad how often you hear of athletes declaring for bankrupcy when they made millions in their careers.</UTT>its actually really sad, so do you have a favorite football team? mine are the Eagles</UTT>I actually follow the Jaguars myself.  But the Eagles are a good team.  The have some unruly fans for sure

The terms is called as robotics.</UTT>That's cool!  I read somewhere that Michael Jackson planned to build a 50 foot tall moon walking robot to roam the desert sands of Las Vegas.</UTT>In Industrial age, the robot is developed very much even they used in operation theater.</UTT>Exactly, I'd like one of those robots that can  debone a chicken for me in my chicken.  I hate doing that job.</UTT>In some field, Robot replace humans to work in a dangerous environment like at the bottom of the sea and in the outer space area we need it. To perform the repetitive task we used it.</UTT>Do you know robots can be controlled by using a rat brain?</UTT>No, Military use the robot for the security purpose to remove bombs.</UTT>I didn't know it either, I just found it interesting.  I had heard about the military using robots to remove bobs.  But, did you know the military uses an XBOX 360 controller to control one of their EOD robots?</UTT>Its very interesting. Domestic robots are used to clean and maintenance of in and out to the house.  Robots such as turtle used in school program.</UTT>Awesome.  On a side note, do you use Netflix?</UTT>To watch movie. It create half of peak internet traffic in north america.</UTT>Yeah, I had heard that Netflix and Youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in North America.  I contribute to that statistic, I'm sure. Lol</UTT>The company expanded in 2010 streaming online videos make next step to technologies.</UTT>Yeah, I bet Blockbuster wishes they hadn't declined several offers to buy Netflix for $50 million, because it's now worth $2 Billion.</UTT>In 2019 Netflix has 139 million paid subscriptions, US has more than 50 million subscriptions. But some countries China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.</UTT>I feel bad for people in Mainland China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea. They'd probably like being able to watch Netflix, too?</UTT>Yes. The earth is third planet in the solar system. Water is also present only in this earth in liquid form.</UTT>Ok, that's totally random.  But, I agree with you and it's a darn nice place to live, too.</UTT>Almost 71% of earth surface entirely covers with water but its not suitable for drinking purpose. Only 3 % is allowable for drinking purpose.</UTT>I like water, Did you know that more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have already been destroyed?  It's so sad!</UTT>So only we are facing lot of issues like Global warming and sudden Tsunami and Volcano eruption.</UTT>Again that's totally random.  Well, it's been quite interesting chatting with you this morning. I need to go walk my dog, now.  I'll talk to you later, friend.
t_2bae8a0b-79fd-48e5-9d4c-a5f5353eec1d</CONV>hello,  did you know that the President's guest house is bigger than the white house?  lol</UTT>Speaking of presidents, the only one with a phd is woodrow wilson.  I wonder what it is in?</UTT>I believe it is in Public affairs.</UTT>That would make sense.  Did you ever imagine taking a selfie with a president?  Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration and in his photo was John Wilkes Booth.  Not so great, huh?</UTT>lol did he photobomb it? The first president of Zimbabwe was named President Banana.</UTT>Well our first president couldn't tell a lie and worked with Cherry Trees</UTT>Oh that's a great quality!  I am sure cherry trees were a really good business back then.</UTT>What do you think about Trump replacing the secretary of State with CIA director Mike Pompeo?</UTT>i am not very caught up on politics.  Although I think it is funny that the us senate used the same gavel for 165 year lol</UTT>Truman was apparently onto something when he found so much corruption and waste in the government (in fact 10 to 15 billion dollars that Roosevelt selected him as VP</UTT>I see.  I recently read that women were not allowed to wear pants until 1993 on the us senate.  Isn't that crazy?  Its cold lol</UTT>Speaking of fashion and styles, North Korea's Kim Jong Un cuts his own hair due to fear of barbers.  Wonder why?</UTT>probably because he has done horrible things and North Korea doesn't like him so he's scared someone will kill him.  Just a guess though lol</UTT>Speaking of North Korea, incoming Pompeo thinks that it is a threat to the United States and not just because of its nuclear weapons but from software risks.</UTT>I think its funny that Kim jong un learned to drive at age 3.  lol</UTT>How does one learn to drive at age 3?</UTT>I have no clue lol Maybe he just taught himself,  but I don't get how he could even touch the pedals lol</UTT>How do you teach yourself at age 3?</UTT>Not sure,  maybe he watched someone do it,  or trial and error, or maybe watching an educational video since YouTube wasn't around.</UTT>Well maybe he watched one of Fred Rogers videos.  Rogers passionately argued before the senate of the US in 1969 for continued funding of pbs.</UTT>Oh that is interesting.  good chatting.
t_a11382ac-a5df-4f15-9e17-7f73463aeaff</CONV>Do you like hocky or follow the NHL?</UTT>I don't know much about hockey. Are you a fan yourself?</UTT>No not really, I do like the Golden Knights though, they are having a great season considering they are an expansion team</UTT>I know that Canada has dominated the sport in the past. In 1924, the first Olympic winter games, Canada scored 132 goals and let in 3 in the entire ice hockey competition.</UTT>Yeah I guess Canada has a great hockey team, thats like their official sport, with lacrosse.</UTT>The only country with two national sports! Hockey is a tough sport! An average professional hockey player will lose up to 8 pounds in one game. I wonder if that's true for lacrosse.</UTT>I dont know, I think hockey is one of the most challenging games both physically and mentally, you know a hockey player was traded for only $1 back in 93</UTT>A $1? They must have thought he was worthless!</UTT>I agree but that same player won four Stanley Cups after that so they learn the hard way they gifted a really talented player.</UTT>I wonder who that was. The space for the rink is used efficiently. An ice hockey rink stays under a basketball court when switching sports</UTT>I guess thats a good way to use the space available, do you listen to the radio much?</UTT>I used to listen to the radio when I was younger, but I now I just use the Internet. Youtube is my spot.</UTT>Youtube is great, although I listen to the radio on the way to work, there is station that has a classic latin program</UTT>That one  in Finland? I wonder who proposed that program and who listens to it.</UTT>Im not sure, I wouldnt understand a word though, that is a fact, there is a website were you can access thousands of free drama episodes</UTT>I wonder who listens to those shows! They're from the previous generation, who probably doesn't use the internet as much.</UTT>Yeah, I prefer to watch movies rather than listen to a drama show, changing the subject a bit did you ever play nintendo?</UTT>I never really played the NES. I did play the GameBoy a lot. What about you?</UTT>GameBoy is an icon, I had one too and yeah I did play the with the NES, too bad it got discontinued on 2003!</UTT>Did you really play the system until 2003? There were so many other great systems out there at that point. The NES had only 54 colors.</UTT>No not untill 2003 but I feel sorry because it would be nice to buy one now and play all those classic games
t_f425531c-1035-4104-b12a-7eb5d9aebf2b</CONV>Hey hows it going? Do you use amazon? I use it all the time and its hard to believe each amazon warehouse worker walks between 7 and 15 miles on average!</UTT>Yeah I use it often.  That is incredible that they walk that far every day lol</UTT>Yeah I was sorry to hear Jeff Bezos divorced his wife. Hard to believe he founded it way back in 1994!</UTT>That is a real bummer for sure.  I think it's amazing some of the stuff he has accomplished though, like building that clock that should run for 10,000 years</UTT>Yeah thats pretty cool. Also I didn't know Amazon owned IMDB-the movie rating page. Speaking of movies the new alladin is coming out soon. Robin Williams voiced the genie in the original and he was the first actor to start the trent of voicing animated films!</UTT>Yeah I didn't know about the IMDB thing...  it's sweet thought that they are coming out with a new Aladdin; I wonder who will do the voice for genie. I would hope they don't meet the same end as Robin did.  The pressure on them due to their wealth and lifestyles can be dangerous.</UTT>Yeah thats true. It's Will Smith this time-he should be good I think. Apparently Ethiopia has a celebrity tv chef who thinks he can solve his countries hunger problem by encouraging them to eat diverse foods. I think they just need more money.</UTT>Nice!  I'm sure Big Willie Styles will do a great job, he is very talented.  I agree about Ethiopia; they do need funding more than diverse foods lol. Hey, did you know that there is 3g cell service and internet at the peak of Mt. Everest?</UTT>Dang I didn't know that. Impressive. That would be a good cell phone commercial. The internet is a crazy thing. Apparently the library of alexandria has saved a copy of the internet-didn't know you could do that.</UTT>Lol I think that is a joke but not sure.  You know the Romans burned the original library at Alexandria while attempting to defeat Hannibal's navy.</UTT>Wow really? War is terrible how it destroys so many things. Drone warfare is even crazier. Jd.com is a site testing drone deliveries in rural areas so atleast drones are being used for something beneficial.</UTT>Indeed.  They have even targeted U.S. citizens with those things.   It's cool to see the private sector using them though, I guess the USPS has contracted with Amazon to deliver even on Sunday!</UTT>One of the reasons I love the US-best place to be a consumer for sure. Wish I was the first amazon customer so I could have had a building named after me!</UTT>Lol you and I both! And for only $27.95!  Can you believe that Amazon passed up WalMart as the most valuable public company?</UTT>Yeah they are such a powerhouse nowadays. What are your thoughts on wealth distribution? Sure would be nice to be a billionaire.</UTT>Well I do agree that there is too much money at the top of the food chain here in the U.S.; but I also respect the hard work and dedication many of the rich have put into their businesses.  I think the answer is to grow the middle class and leave the wealthy to their own devices.  The blue collar workers have things like the 2004 outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome to deal with; they need good insurance and a decent working wage.</UTT>Yeah thats a great point well said. It frustrates me when billionaires get special treatment or get away with things. For example the billionaire tech mogul Liu returned to China from the US despite being arrested for sexual assault</UTT>Totally.. that is one good example of money being the root of all evil.  I saw that he is also one of those who are pushing for 100 percent automation to reduce or eliminate workers.  Who does he think is going to buy their products if there are no workers to spend money on them?  I can't believe they let him walk without even posting bond, much less to leave the country!</UTT>Yeah this cannot happen. The future may be bright for somethings but it often scares me in other aspects. Hopefully we will be able to figure everything out with as few mistakes as possible.</UTT>Agreed.  We have a lot to learn still.  One thing is that people are agreeing to terms and conditions they haven't even bothered to read...  Only 7% actually read the full terms when they sign up for something online.  Great talking to you, take care!</UTT>Jeez that is surprising! Have a goodnight!</UTT>Likewise :)</UTT>See ya!</UTT>Later :)
t_3ba25756-3330-49b7-8f09-a8a354c92bc6</CONV>Hi!  Do you follow football?</UTT>I sometimes follow football. It is an interesting game. You?</UTT>Sometimes, if my team is in it.  They havent been recently though.</UTT>I try to watch the big games like the Super Bowl.</UTT>Same here, I missed it this year though.  The Patriots won... again...</UTT>I usually root for the underdog. I guess the underdog did not win this year.</UTT>Same here.  Did you know the Eagles had a temporary court set up in their stadium because of their fans poor behavior?  People getting bent out of shape over a game.</UTT>They are passionate. It is like a religion. It is played on Sundays. It is a substitute for politics.</UTT>It is.  Tom Brady even has his own method the TB12.  It is like his religion.</UTT>I guess that every great player is asked to start his own religion. He certainly must have a number of followers.</UTT>There are some people who consider him a Messiah.  Going a bit far for my opinion.</UTT>I agree. He is just a football player. There is no need to worship him. There are plenty of other deities around.</UTT>did you know Kiss bought an arena football team and offered a contract to Tebow?</UTT>KISS probably wanted to cash in on the football craze. For a while LA didn't have a team. I don't know how much money KISS made.</UTT>Neither do I , I dont know how popular arena football is anymore.  I dont hear much about it.</UTT>I think that the NFL has expanded so that other leagues cannot take the fans away. Longer season, more teams.</UTT>True.  People tend to be loyal fans, even when their team is bad.</UTT>That is also true. NFL is older than other leagues, so the fans have been following longer.</UTT>Very true, I know my family has rooted for the Dolphins forever, no matter how bad they are.</UTT>They were great back in the 70s. Now, not so much. Their time will come again though. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>You too!  Have a good day!
t_2b3c7a1b-c645-4fbf-bcf1-686487157ac7</CONV>Hi!  Are you a facebook user?</UTT>Yes, I do use it, but mostly for the games app's social part. I'd rather play a game. I've heard the Virtual Reality video games are pretty cool. Would you try?</UTT>I think I would try it to see what it was like.</UTT>I've seen lots of examples on Facebook of people playing a VR game and getting terrified or surprised. It looks like a lot of fun!</UTT>I wonder how much the headsets cost for it?  The fist virtual reality game was made in 1968.  I had no idea they were around then.</UTT>I thought I've heard that VR has been used for training soldiers, so I wonder if it could have been around for even longer than 1968, but kept secret!</UTT>Quite possible.  I read where 40 percent of users experience motion sickness in virtual reality.</UTT>Well, that part doesn't sound very fun. Did you know there is a NASA scientist who genuinely believes we're living in a reality generated by a computer? Or maybe multiple computers...</UTT>I didn't know that.  I know that Lockheed Martin has a virtual reality "Mars bus" that can take kids on a tour of Mars.  That would be neat.</UTT>Wow, I was excited when I heard a company was starting art buses to park in lots of shopping centers to look after kids while parents shop. I can't even imagine how great a VR Mars tour bus would be!!!</UTT>Hahaha  Do you know anyone that has the Oculus Rift VR headset that Facebook released?</UTT>I don't, but I'd love to try it. I am really interested in those augmented reality systems that area a type of VR. I had an idea for those Google glasses before they came out, even!</UTT>Nice!  Stanford's free artificial intelligence class uses Google plus hangouts to help them teach more effectively.  What do you think of AI?  It kind of scares me. lol</UTT>Meant to say augmented reality. I think it's strange how Tesler's Theorem for AI is whatever hasn't been done yet. Does that mean he wouldn't call the VR games AI?</UTT>I have no idea.  Good question.  AI has crushed all human records in the puzzle game "2048".  I haven't heard of that game.</UTT>I haven't heard of that game, either. There's a game I play where you get better by doing daily tasks. I should make an AI device to do it for me!</UTT>lol Nice!  Did you hear about the promotion that Burger King ran where if you were to unfriend 10 people on Facebook they would give you a free whopper?  I would have taken them up on that.</UTT>I think there were probably people catching on and adding 10 random people just to unfriend, though! Can you believe that in a part of Germany the Facebook like button is illegal?</UTT>I wonder why?  I'm going to have to look that up.  I wonder what Myspace thinks of passing up on the chance to buy Facebook for $75 million in 2005?  Is Myspace even still around?</UTT>I think MySpace is around but everyone uses Facebook instead. I think Facebook is worth hundreds of billions today.</UTT>In 2012 when they had their IPO they were valued at $104 billion then.  So you are right. I'm sure it's more than that now.  It's been fun chatting with you!
t_1cebc225-f179-4663-8d16-3d0a5a0f0f1d</CONV>hello!so do you like rap music? Or Cardi B?</UTT>I do like rap music, I heard Cardi B is pregnant,</UTT>Yes, she announced it on SNL  in April. She was on a radio show and said she wasn't sure she wanted the baby....</UTT>Im sure that created a lot of controversy, there were many critics she was also on the Breakfast Club radio show</UTT>It has caused controversy because she didn't debate the pro life stance really.</UTT>Oh so thats why, she also said ''Why do I got to chose a carrer over a baby'' meaning she could have both and I agree with her</UTT>Definitely you can! But when she was asked initially they asked are you ready for a baby...she said kinda..sorta. But she's making the right choice! She has a lot of political views so that answer started stirred feelings...</UTT>I think thats a hard question, most people arent ready for a baby and I think her baby wasnt planed, she is 25 years old and with a carreer in front of her so its a tough question to answer</UTT>Yes, it is. I guess she was unsure how to answer since she has many conservative and liberal fans. I think it must be tough to try and keep your personal life...personal.</UTT>Its hard to keep your personal live personal when you are a celebrity she must have a lot of fans and thats always hard to manage</UTT>Exactly. In her music she advocates for women being able to have their own choice. She doesn't want to come outright and say either way.</UTT>I think her message is good, children dont kill dreams, a dream will only die if you let it, with hard work you can do just about everything.</UTT>Very true. So you said you like Rap, do you have a favorite artist? I listen to rap sometimes on the radio.</UTT>My favorite rapper is Tupac and also Snoop Dog, do you have a favorite one?</UTT>I would have to say Tupac as well. He was and is amazing. His music is actually saved in a library of congress!</UTT>He is amazing, too bad how he died at a young age, another great rapper is Eminem</UTT>Very sad! And yes I love Eminem, I like a few of his songs. He doesn't have much on the radio anymore, but I am sure he's working on something. He wrote some great music for the movie Southpaw.</UTT>He wanted to be a comic book artists, Eminem, good thing he decided to become a rapper</UTT>Exactly, now he can do anything he wants. One time a judge handed down her ruling to Eminem in the form of a Rap song....that had to be funny.</UTT>I agree but also really unprofessiional lol, she is/was a judge afterall</UTT>Right! I agree. Speaking of funny did you know the U.S presidents through history who had a beard were Republican?? That's odd. Maybe the Republicans and Democrats can get together and do a new Rap freestyle called a compliment battle and play it on the radio, that would be interesting! I hope you have a great day! Nice chatting! Bye
t_4158a835-ff82-44e8-a8c3-000acc8ab76f</CONV>Hi, do you like the piano?</UTT>I can listen to the piano when I'm in the mood, would love to be able to play.</UTT>It's fun to play. The BBC decided in 1930 there was no news worth reporting so they played piano music instead.</UTT>Some times it might be best if the news did that now.  Some people get so worked up about it.  Some relaxing piano might everyone more happy.</UTT>I think it's very relaxing as well.</UTT>Do you watch much theater, I've heard that the Waitress is a good play.</UTT>I do not. Do you watch a lot of theater?</UTT>Not really, used to live in DC where it was more available.  The most I watch now is school performances.  My daughter is in a version of Annie Get You gun soon</UTT>Very cool. In 2006, a group of climbers reached the top of Britian's highest mountain and found a piano.</UTT>Someones idea of a practical joke I guess.  That's a lot of effort for a joke. Even if were made of aluminium is would still be hard.</UTT>I agree. Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody as Mccartney used to record Hey Jude.</UTT>It must be a good piano, maybe inspirational.  I feel like I'm more of a guitar person than a piano type, more portable.</UTT>I love the guitar. Do you know how to play?</UTT>Picked it up a few times but never put the effort in to really learn.  It's frustrating when it doesn't do what you want, feel like smashing it as Matt Bellamy does.</UTT>I can play a little. Van Halen recorded the guitar solo Beat It and set the speakers on fire.</UTT>Through his actual playing, or he put a flame to them?  I guess if we've learned one thing today it's that musicians are destructive.  Maybe they need a hobby, like astrophysics.</UTT>It doesn't really say. That's funny!</UTT>If you don't watch theater, do you watch dramas on TV?</UTT>I watch a little drama. What about you?</UTT>When I get the time, usually pick one good drama on Netflix and then work through it to the end.  My wife loves that House at the moment.</UTT>That's how I do it too. Well, it was very good talking to you today. Have a great rest of your day.
t_cc243619-5d4f-4647-8ee9-076da7dd1682</CONV>Do you like to watch TV?</UTT>I love to watch sitcoms. what about you?</UTT>Im more of a cartoon person myself, I love the Simpsons, Soutpark, shows like those.</UTT>I too love to watch the animated shows. I can't stand watching Pokemon though.</UTT>For real? I used to love that show, poor Pikachu, I guess not everyone likes him</UTT>I heard they are making a new movie called Detective Pikachu. You should go watch it. There's over 750 episodes of pokemon. That's a lot...</UTT>I  think I might, its been over 16 years but I love the show still, do you like The Simpsons?</UTT>I could watch simpsons, but I prefer Family Guy due to the references made. It's something worth watching over and over again. Same as Bob's Burgers.</UTT>Family Guy is a funny show, I really like it, South Park is another great show, not really for kids though</UTT>The kids in South Park have been stuck in 3rd grade for 20+ years. That's just obscured... Granted now they try to link every episode up. Previously it was just killing Kenny all the time.</UTT>Poor Kenny he died every time, it was repetitive but always funny,</UTT>Princess Kenny! Youtube has a summation of all of kenny's deaths. Worth watching in my opinion. It is the second largest search engine on the net.</UTT>I might watch it, seems like a worthwhile video, and yeah Youtube has grown a lot over the years</UTT>Yah. Psy gangnam style was so popular... and remember getting rick rolled?</UTT>That video was so funny, Youtube had to upgreade the view count integer because of that video</UTT>Both netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america. that's a lot!</UTT>Both services are popular, do you use YouTube Red? sounds like a great streaming service, havent use it myself</UTT>I've used it. It's a great service. Give it a try, it's a free month. If you want access to a free collection, there's always the library.</UTT>Do you like to read?</UTT>Not really, but I don't mind listening to an audiobook. that's why i love the library.</UTT>Books can set you free, literally, a man that was falsely imprisoned studied law at the library and then proved his innocence
t_2219780e-58df-41bb-98df-0529d34883b1</CONV>hi, do you know what wikileaks is?</UTT>hey yes I'm aware, its funny they published government plans that were shown to want to destroy wikileaks itself</UTT>yeah, go figure. did you know the majority of land in nevada is woned by te government?</UTT>didn't know that, but I did know that Norway gave one billion dollars to help save the rainforest back in 2008</UTT>that is so amazing of them to do. a man in france sold the eiffel tower twice</UTT>ya that guy is ballsy, do you know who the top 3 richest presidents were?</UTT>yeah jefferson, jfk and washington, considering inflation</UTT>yup thats what I'm thinking, our president isn't like the indonesian one who released 3 pop albums haha</UTT>yes talk about a pop star president, wondering if they are any good</UTT>ya I'll have to check it out, but maybe Trump and Kanye could make a pop album, they could stay in the Guest house!</UTT>yeah considering it is bigger than the white house</UTT>yup that is shocking, do you have a big shoe collection? I only have a couple pairs myself</UTT>not too many actually. do you have a favorite kind?</UTT>well I have boots I wear a lot right now, whats funny is that there is a pair of 5000 year old shoes that performs better than modern shoes haha</UTT>wow they must have known how to make better boots back in the day</UTT>haha ya I want to wear those shoes, did you hear that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shoes s week?</UTT>that is insane. do you know how to get the smell out of shoes?</UTT>well I have read either baking soda or tea bags will fix that, have you tried that?</UTT>yeah i tried it with baking soda and it actually helps quite a bit</UTT>oh wow I'll have to look at that, kind of nice that Steve Smith leaves his cleats out for homeless people after every game</UTT>that is so nice of him. nice chat
t_b97afef2-4fcd-4709-9a0a-36753761ab12</CONV>Basketball season is upon us, And even the Supreme Court is playing the game. Did you know that the top floor of the Supreme court building has a B-Ball court dubbed "the highest court in the land?"</UTT>I didnt know that! thats really interesting, other interesting fact is that the coach is the highest paid employee in a Basketball team.</UTT>Especially in college b-ball. Speaking of b-ball, did you know that the inventor of the game, James Naismith, is the losing coach in the Univ of Kansas's history?</UTT>Really thats interesting, sounds crazy because he invented the game, there is also a New Zealand team called tall blacks, kind of racist</UTT>For sure! Even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who got the slam dunk banned from college ball, would agree.</UTT>Speaking of bans the air jordans were also banned from the NBA but Nike paid for the fine and didnt care.</UTT>Nice.  Iverson signed a lifetime deal with Reebok in 2001 that paid him $800k per year until age 55, when ye gets a lump sum of $32mil, while  we are doing internet games for pennies...</UTT>I get you, life is unfair like that lol , do you follow the Golden State Warriors team?</UTT>No. I am not much of an NBA fan. I do shoot free throws Granny style though, since it is the method preferred by physicists.</UTT>Oh yeah, I wonder why pros dont take Granny Style shots ore often, that can be a game saver</UTT>I did follow the career of San Antonio's Tim Duncan though. I really respected his decision to stay in college four years even though he could have jumped to the pros early. It certainly didn't hurt his career.</UTT>It didnt but he sure lost a lot of money because of that, not sure it was the right choice but it is admirable for sure.</UTT>I respect character more than money. Like Steph Curry of the Warriors, who donates mosquito nets to protect Africans every time he hits a 3-point shot. He may lose a little money, but he does a good thing. Gotta respect that.</UTT>That is admirable, did you know the Warriors earned about 12 million by losing a game</UTT>I guess that is the "gold" in Golden State. Stranger things have happened in Oakland, California.</UTT>Yeah, Oakland is sure a place of surprises and The Golden State warriors are also full of them.</UTT>Sure thing. Like when they played their 1975 playoff game in "Cow Palace" because their home venue was booked for something else. Strange.</UTT>I wonder how that went lol, and also in the las 20 years only 3 number one picks have won a championship.</UTT>And strangely enough, Golden State Warriors were among those number one picks. The force must be with them.</UTT>Basketball is sure a nice game, a field goal is worth 2 points and then 3 pointers are even more exiting.</UTT>Makes for an entertaining game to watch. Hey, thanks for chatting with me!
t_b7f812d7-d50c-4545-aa50-99c19643550f</CONV>Do you like to watch movies?</UTT>I do like to watch movies.  They are generally well crafted escapist entertainment. I might be a super hero as well.</UTT>I love hero movies, do you have a favorite hero, mine is Spiderman or Peter Parker</UTT>Can I say that Robbie the robot from the original lost in space is my hero.  Always around and in the way. Danger Will robinson, Danger.</UTT>That movie was pretty good, Lost in Space, it has a great cast including Molly Parker</UTT>Why is it you enjoy Peter Parker.  Most super heroes today are hapless everyman's who get special powers and use them for good.  Is there a wrong you need to right?</UTT>No I only think his powers are super cool did you watch Avengers Infinity War?</UTT>I admit, I have not seen Avengers Infinity War.  I did watch the Lost in Space Remake.  It was entertaining.  But it worried me the way they bounced from ridiculous danger to imminent peril to life threatening situation. It was a bit much.</UTT>Would you recommend Lost in Space? whats it about just wondering, seems like a good movie</UTT>The family, the robinsons, are trying to get to a new planet.  They are colonists.  Stuff goes wrong. They crash on some unknown planet.  They survive.  It is not a movie, but a show with a number of episodes.  Intense action. Danger.  If the action of super hero movie is good four you, you will like.</UTT>Sounds interesting, anyways do you subscribe to Netflix?</UTT>I do subscribe to Netflix.  I have made a note to look for "Killing Eve"  The description of the show seems vague on what actually happens.  Spy thriller or what?</UTT>Its available in Netflix its a British series it seems, I haven seen that one before though, it looks interesting</UTT>Dark Humor sometimes appeals Sandra Oh might be nice as well.</UTT>Im not really sure I like dark humor, but I try to keep an open mind about it</UTT>It kind of funny that Lou Ferrigno, the original TV hulk still does hulk voice.  Hulk smash.  All these characters were created in the 1930's.</UTT>He does? thats really interesting, do you know Jarvis, Starks assistant?</UTT>No, Stark is Iron Man.  But Jarvis is not a character I know.</UTT>Well Jarvis is his computer assistant and the person who does the voice of Jarvis had never seen an Avengers movie, I think thats funny.</UTT>Yes, if you do the work, you should at least see the end result.  Do you like shawarma?</UTT>I do yeah, one of my favorite foods why do you ask?</UTT>It is documented that shawarma sales go up because of avengers movies.  I like shawarma, but never thought to link the two.</UTT>I guess its because of the ending scene, heroes gather at end at a Shawarma place, in fact im getting a but hungry not a bad idea, thanks for the chat I think im going to eat a Shawarma now,</UTT>I would not have known that unless I watched the movie, or had you to explain. Thanks.</UTT>Thank to you, I feel I have learn a lot of interesting facts, have a nice day, bye
t_860e885b-c72e-4e9e-a295-935f99b67c12</CONV>Hey there what do you think about planet Earth? It's amazing that Earth has only one natural satellite aka the Moon</UTT>Oh, really? That is really interesting.</UTT>It is interesting, but something that's sad is that four-fifths of the world's natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think</UTT>I think so too. I can't believe when the earth was first formed, one day was 5.5 hours long!</UTT>I know right! do you think that days are getting longer overtime? Like will we have a 40 hour day at some point in the future</UTT>I'm not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long!</UTT>What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven't had contact yet</UTT>It must be very boring. If we ever do have contact, I wonder if they would tell us?</UTT>That's a good point! Scary thing about our current trajectory is that Earth will be out of helium by the year 2100, I know that you love him very important for manufacturing things so I don't know what we'll do</UTT>It's very scary to think about, hopefully we don't.</UTT>What other interesting fact, is that if all of history was 24 hours, humans would only take up about 1 minute worth of the 24 hours, isn't that wild to think about?</UTT>It's very interesting. It's amazing how long the earth has sustained life.</UTT>Yes Earth has been around for a long time for sure. So interesting to me is that Earth is about 71% covered with water. The other 29% is land and various Islands.</UTT>Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn't been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?</UTT>I know right! I always wanted to go treasure hunting and get some gold from like sunken ships or something haha. Do you like science fiction by the way?</UTT>I think it's great to learn about.</UTT>Yes I think it's interesting, one cool thing to is that NASA has a list of space technology words that writers can use so that they are making accurate statements in the movie</UTT>That is awesome! I seen something about starship troopers is the only science fiction novel that is used by three of the five branches in the us military.</UTT>Yep you're right! Have you seen the movie? The movie is really violent but I liked it, it's from the director of Robocop. I can't believe it's on the military reading list though</UTT>Yeah me either! A judge in 1950's tried to ban science fiction comics. Get this, because there was a black character!</UTT>Yeah that's horrible! interesting that the term "robotic" was created by a science fiction author, you'd think that it would have been an actual science term, and this happened back in 1941 haha</UTT>I know right! haha, well it was nice talking to you, I've got to fix dinner now. Bye! :)
t_500af0d1-a805-4cca-8815-1e093eee1c81</CONV>Trump is a character</UTT>He's definitely an interesting president that's for sure. Another interesting president was Woodrow Wilson. He's the only one to have a Ph.D</UTT>The only one? really? he must be really smart did you hear about the president of Indonesia and his 3 pop albums</UTT>I did! I didn't hear if they were very successful though haha. Do you like the rules in Guatemala for presidents?</UTT>I think the rules are fair, you can rule out authoritarian regimes that way</UTT>Yep I agree. I think we should have that here. One weird Quirk of our election system is that you can lose the popular vote and still win. that happened five times in our history</UTT>Theres something wrong with our system lol, did you know that Trump has a guest house bigger than the white house?</UTT>That is weird! Also weird that FDR spoke of foreign language and was the last president to do so</UTT>I see well enough of politics, what are your thoughs on Google?</UTT>Well I do like Google. I personally use being though haha. I have a Google phone. I guess you can zoom in to Google moon, which is like Google Earth but the moon, and originally if you zoomed in far enough it would have a picture of cheese haha</UTT>Google has an interesting line of smartphones, a single Google search requires a lot of computing power, more than the power it took for the astronauts to get to the moon</UTT>Wow that is impressive. have you ever typed the word "askew" into google? it's supposed to make the page tilt but I just did it and it didn't do anything haha</UTT>I havent lol, I might try it later and maybe they corrected the bug, do you use the Google maps app as well?</UTT>I used all the time. It's the only thing I have on when I'm driving LOL what about you? Did you hear what Google call their new employees?</UTT>Nok, how do they call their new employees?</UTT>haha they call them nooglers and make wear propellear beanie caps lol</UTT>Thats messed up lol, you know that Google maps calculates traffic by tracking android devices and how fast they move</UTT>That's really cool! Also did you know that Gmail was started by the Garfield website? Google bought the domain name from them</UTT>I didnt know that I like Garfield, his a silly cat, Google is a big empire now, really powerful company</UTT>What do you think of Google's electricity use? They use about one-tenth of 1% of the worldwide electricity</UTT>That sounds like a lot of energy for a company,

How many really?</UTT>Well it is a lot , it is about 160 000</UTT>Wow that is impressive. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?</UTT>Hmmm I actually do not know that. Do you know CHicago Cubs?</UTT>It is called soccer-baseball which seems quite fitting considering what the sport is like</UTT>Yeah I can see that actually. Do you watch Netflix at all?</UTT>A lot actually. Do you know how it all got started?</UTT>I do not know actually, and I am not sure I know the name of the guy who invented it. DO you know?</UTT>Yeah the guy who invented it got a late fee of $40 for a VHS and I guess was sick of it</UTT>I can see that, well we are grateful to him about that it is great and also cheap</UTT>Yeah that is true. Blockbuster had the chance to buy them and did not.</UTT>WOw that was a bad decision. They have a job called the tagger where all you have to do is sit and watch netflix content and tag it</UTT>I would have loved that job. Together with youtube they make peak internet traffic in north america</UTT>Not surprised there. Have you heard of the movie Fireplace for your home?</UTT>I have not, what is it about. I do not think I have heard of it before</UTT>It is literally nothing but a fireplace that plays for an hour</UTT>Haha that is funny but must be relaxing too. Netflix still spends more on postage than bandwidth</UTT>That is kind of strange to me. In Europe they monitor illegal downloads to figure which shows to purchase</UTT>Wow that is some serious business people at work there.
t_0c5bd1cc-c83b-455a-9fe9-94e194d54fa4</CONV>Hello, do you listen to Spotify?</UTT>Hi there, yes I do. About 20% of their songs have never been  played</UTT>WOw that is a lot of songs, I think it totals to 4 million</UTT>Yeah that is a lot. They have audible watermarks to in the songs, pretty cool</UTT>Yeah that is cool. They do that in iTunes as well as Spotify</UTT>Yeah. For musicians to earn minimum wage they need to get over 130000 listens in spotify</UTT>That is a lot of listens in a day. A band once made $20000 from spotify for a silent album</UTT>Oh yeah them and they used that moned to fund a free tour</UTT>Nice good choice. Do you know who developed Spotify?</UTT>Yes it was the same Swedish programmer that developed utorrent</UTT>Yeah pretty smart guy I must say. Do you also use youtube much?</UTT>I do actually, It is the second largest search engine n the net</UTT>Yes it sure is. Did you know why they had to up their view count originally?</UTT>Yes it was all about Gangnam Style, that song is something all right</UTT>Yes it sure is. Do you know which is the most disliked video in there?</UTT>Yes it is Baby by Justin Bieber, I wonder how many views it has though</UTT>Yeah good point. Youtube nnd netflix make peak internet traffic in north america</UTT>I am not surprised actually. Have you heard of Bluetube?</UTT>I have actually, it is kind of like the youtube of police, right?</UTT>yeah and they have video of police stunts and such in there. Pretty cool</UTT>Yeah that is. And all this came from three former Paypal employees, smart guys
t_dd68d82c-adfb-4443-9412-527f3dbdbeb6</CONV>hi, do you like rap?</UTT>Yo, word up. I'm all. like, flowing with rhytmical delivery here ya'll.  Ok, so I'm an old white dude, but I still like rap. You?</UTT>yeah I like it too. do you like eminem?</UTT>A bit harsh for me. I like rap that harkens back to the day when praise singers would use their art form to disseminate positive info. You?</UTT>yeah I agree. Eminem though did not dream of becoming a rapper originally</UTT>Really? When did he unwrap his rap gift? I'm not sure he will ever be listed in the librabry of congress under "cultural significances" but he has talent.</UTT>yeah he is not up there with tupac but he wanted to be a comic book artist</UTT>EEveryone wants to be a rapper at times. A michigan judge once delivered a verdict in rap, when ruling over a case involving Eminem. I wonder if that judge was a better rapper than a judge?</UTT>I would have liked to hear that actually. how about busta rhymes, do you like him?</UTT>I don't know if I have heard him, other than as the reptar wagon in the Rugrats movie... I would live to hear some Korean rap!</UTT>yeah one of those compliment rap battels?</UTT>Yeah! If Robin Williams was still around, I would love to see him do that! He was great in Alladin!</UTT>Yeah for sure, funny guy too. do you know the Pixar stdio?</UTT>I have never been there. You?</UTT>No, I am not a celebrity so apparently I cannot visit their secret room</UTT>Carol Burnett was the first celebrity that visited Sesame Street. Ever been there?</UTT>I have not actually. do you know judge judy?</UTT>Don't tell me you have been there! What was your case about? LOL I hear she pulls down over 100 grand per episode. Not bad!</UTT>yeah, she is the second person to make more than LeBron James</UTT>I would love to be in his shoes, although they would fit me... Maybe I could fit in Carol Burnett's shoes</UTT>hahaa good one. nice chat
t_4547ba98-008d-4848-a5dd-27ee726699eb</CONV>Do you like dramas ?</UTT>Well, I got a lotta drama in my life. But I don't mind it if its in the form of opera, ballet, theatre, etc</UTT>Which is your favorite ? I love movies.</UTT>Well I like Soap Operas....not sure what Dove has to do with them though</UTT>They were the main sponsor of them in the 50s. They lost the sponsorship but the name stuck, people also change Jim Carrey does not want to act in a drama anymore.</UTT>Interesting. So what does Carrey want to do? Play concerts? He is loud, not unlike Deep Purple</UTT>Maybe he got lazy and does not want to do anything else other than a comedy. Even that, when was his latest film ?</UTT>I dunno. Maybe 335 BC. Or was that Aristotle's Poetics.</UTT>I think Dumb and Dumber is more recent than 335 bc, besides Jim Carrey is not that old. That would make him more than 2000 years old.</UTT>He doesn't look a day over 1500!  Maybe he should take some classes for Patrick Stewert...to rekindle his interest in drama.</UTT>Or to meet girls that's why Micheal Cain went into drama.</UTT>Really? Did it work? He should just ride a bike. A women going to a Dave Mathews concert stopped to help a stranded cyclist...who turned out to be Dave Mathews</UTT>Concert are even more special when they are held in weird places, like roman amphitheater.</UTT>I wonder if that would be a good location for a high frequency concert. Dogs like music too</UTT>Dogs can like music ? I knew they can understand pointing.</UTT>yeah..once they figure out what you are pointing at, they have a eureka moment. they love it</UTT>Do you have a dog ? I don't but  I like them.</UTT>Yeah....he uses the subway...and i don't even live in Moscow</UTT>Ok, what about Moscow ? Do they have anything special with dogs, like Istanbul ?</UTT>Yeah..they take the subway there too. what's up with instanbul?</UTT>They have vending machine that give food and water to stray dogs in exchange of empty water bottles.</UTT>Very cool. Nice chatting with you!
t_c29b4516-d454-429f-bd97-8f34f4f5942e</CONV>What do you think about the new plan of the Trump administration? do you think it could work.</UTT>I don't think it's going to work at all. For one thing, he's only implementing it on TV. What about the other mediums?</UTT>Yeah I agree, I think the fight against drugs is a hard one and needs a bigger action, I am worried about the side effects it can bring.</UTT>I'm worried that the consumers are not as informed about drugs and prescriptions. Also, many people cannot afford health insurance, so even with lower drug costs, they may still be too high.</UTT>I think that lowering the price on drugs will make the people consume more and wont change things it all, it will only make things worse.</UTT>What do you think is the problem we need to address then? They're not talking about illegal drugs, it's about prescription drugs.</UTT>Oh I see, I misunderstood it, and well then lowering prices can be a good thing, but I do agree resources should be focused on better insurance coverage.</UTT>I think private insurance companies and government programs like Medicare should work together to provide the best coverage for people, and not focus so much on making money. Generic versus name brand is just a label at the end of the day, what matters is whether or not the treatments and medications work.</UTT>I agree generic treatments are usually equally effective than the name brand products, the big issue here is how to bring those prices down, this has been a problem since Obamas administration.</UTT>I agree, the insurance companies want to make money and they're not going to lower costs on something that they know people need. I think the government should step in and enforce some laws.</UTT>We're on the same page, some sectors of the government and some people might not like that but we have to protect everyone, did you know that in Nevada 86% of the land is actually owned by the government.</UTT>I did not. In 2008, the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to save the Amazon rainforest. What if our government did something like that to help with medical costs?</UTT>That would be an excellent approach, not only our country but the top 1% can help, maybe even Trump can donate money for the cause.</UTT>I totally agree! However, the top three wealthiest presidents in American history were president a long time ago, so I don't know how much money Trump.</UTT>I heard that his guest house is bigger than the White House though.</UTT>I don't think that was on purpose though. I bet the guest house was built after the white house. I wish he had a cool name like the first president of Zimbabwe, who was called Banana</UTT>He should start working on a pop album like the president of Indonesia!</UTT>It would be cool if he hiked to the peak of Mt. Everest, they have 3G cell service and internet up there!</UTT>Do they? thats crazy, how can 3G signal get up there but it would be cool if he addressed the nation from there.</UTT>I don't know how it works but it's so cool! The current library of Alexandria also has a saved copy of the Internet in case it burns down.</UTT>I think thats a good idea, terrible things would happen if the internet went down, I dont even want to imagine it.
t_fd4e70e5-521d-46d9-9157-8a9a994691c2</CONV>Hey there. Do you like various forms of entertainment, like drama or comedy?</UTT>I like both comedy and drama, especially in films. How about you?</UTT>I do, too. Pretty much anything that tells a story and can hold my attention, really. Entertainment evolves to suit any scale.</UTT>I'm not a big fan of bromances, though, like Harold and Kumar, although i did think The Hangover was very funny.  What's your favorite kind of comedy?</UTT>Oh gosh, there are so many types. It's one of the oldest genres of film! I like a good slapstick routine if it's done correctly.</UTT>Oh me too!  I even like the really old stuff, like Charlie Chaplin and especially the Marx Brothers. Do you know them?</UTT>Of course. The early 1900s stuff when there wasn't sound just yet.</UTT>I also like sitcoms like Seinfeld. Did you know 3rd Rock from the Sun beat out Seinfeld, Friends and Frasier to win the best comedy series in 1997?  I barely even know what 3rd Rock from the Sun is!</UTT>Really? It was a really good show! That's why it won the Golden Globe!</UTT>LOL. I see that it's available now on my Roku. Maybe I should watch it.  My favorite sitcom is The Good Place. Have you seen that?</UTT>Yeah, it's great. Did you ever see Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt or the Office? Ellie Kemper, from those shows, was the student of Jon Hamm when he was a drama teacher.</UTT>Been meaning to watch Kimmy Schmidt.  Loved The Office!  So many actors got their start , or got well known, from that one.</UTT>Yeah. It's just funny that Jon Hamm taught her when he was still a teacher and she was still a student, then he was in Kimmy Schmidt with her.</UTT>Small world!  Here's something funny:  Ronald Reagan got turned down for a movie role because an executive didnt think he looked presidential enough.  LOL</UTT>That's pretty funny. Did you hear about how Bill Nye got his start?</UTT>I did! I actually have met Bill Nye. He's from my hometown. Very nice guy. But I don't think he looks like Steve Martin at all!!</UTT>Maybe way back in the day. It must've been the 70s or early 80s.</UTT>That's funny because even back in the 80s Steve Martin looked middle aged.  I guess it's the white hair.  He looks exactly the same now LOL</UTT>That's true. Well, it's been great chatting with you about this stuff!</UTT>You too!</UTT>Go stream 3rd Rock from the Sun! Ciao!
t_8e5f45e7-5495-4429-8859-23d5c08135c4</CONV>Are you a Lady Gaga fan?</UTT>Yes, musically and as an actress. I just heard a new extended version of a star is born is coming out. I can't wait to see the extra footage.</UTT>I have not seen it at all but I am interested. It got a lot of acclaim. Do you know that Lady Gaga is the godmother of Elton John's son?</UTT>Yes, shes tweeted about him a lot. You should follow her on twitter she has well over 11 million followers and posts all kinds of neat stuff.</UTT>I just recently followed her so I missed a lot. Speaking of, did you also know that the LAPD asked her to tweet her followers about some upcoming roadwork?</UTT>I guess they have a lot less followers. Smart idea! She's come a long way since she was on boiling points.</UTT>I forgot that show existed. I had no idea she was on that. I'm sure she's a bit embarrassed about that now.</UTT>Maybe, you know it's funny I love her music but she's not really what I'd consider typical to what I listen to. Then I find out her favorite band is Iron Maiden and it makes sense.</UTT>I didn't know about that either. I usually prefer rock as well but I'm not against some catchy pop here and there to get my day going or to work out to. It has it's place for sure.</UTT>I just wish she'd tour more. I have seen a few of her concerts but there are not that many opportunties.</UTT>You would think she would since that's a lot of the income for singers now. Do you enjoy going to concerts?</UTT>Yes, how about you? I think Linkin Park is the band I've seen the most. They play a lot of shows. Or at least they did :( Sadly there will be no more.</UTT>I used to like it a lot but I don't enjoy the crowds quite as much anymore. I did hear that Linkin Park played 324 concerts in one year. That's insane!</UTT>Yeah I'm really going to miss Chester. They played some really great venues, I wish there were more dvds. In Croatia a roman amphitheater is still in use, I'd love to go there.</UTT>That would be an amazing place to attend a concert. The pictures, the sound, the memory. I would love to do that too.</UTT>I'm glad I got to see Linkin Park so many times when I did, since you never know when it will be over. I'm sad I never got to see the Ramones though. Before my time. They played over 2000 shows!</UTT>I would have seen the Ramones. They have very catchy music and I'm not even a fan of much punk. I had no idea they played that many shows. I know they played at CBGB's a lot so I wonder how many of those were there and how many were tours.</UTT>I think there used to be a sign at CBGB's how many times they played there. Of course like the Ramones that place is long gone now too. I'm glad Roger Waters still tours but it would be nice to see Pink Floyd again.</UTT>It's sad that it's gone. It was such a relic of a cultural movement. I would love to see Pink Floyd. Did you know that they filmed a concert with no audience?</UTT>Yes in Pompeii! I have the DVD. I believe it was just to have a chance to play in that historic roman venue.</UTT>I'm glad they were able to do it then. It was very nice chatting with you. You have a great day.

I put up with a few adverts.</UTT>I don't use it. Though I am a little disgusted that it takes almost 150K plays per day for an artist to earn minimum wage on that platform.</UTT>I've heard something similar, very few artists make enough money on it.  That's the problem with the internet, making something so easily available pushes down the prices.</UTT>I agree. Did you know that there is something called Fantasy Congress? People draft the members, and earn points  from their success at legislating. How odd.</UTT>That's a new one on me.  Do you read fantasy books, I've read a few in my time.</UTT>I do every now and then. I guess I don't have that fold in the brain that makes the difference in perceiving fantasy from reality.</UTT>That's a little harsh on yourself.  Sounds a little like that kid that claimed he'd been to heaven in  a near death experience.</UTT>I've long believed that little kids and animals can see (and experience) things that adults cannot. It's a shame that he felt that he needed to lie like that to get attention. Though I do have to place a lot of the blame on his parents.</UTT>Your right, it seem the father was to blame.  Can't really lay blame on a six year old child.</UTT>I find the entire situation distasteful. Seems like the publisher should have taken some time to fact check the kid and the father.</UTT>I think people love the story and then it takes on a life of it's own, the people originally responsible lose control as it gets bigger and bigger.  I doubt they thought it would become as big as it did.</UTT>Probably. I read that people also do a fantasy draft of the national spelling bee. How much of a gambling addict do you have to be, to do a fantasy draft of kids?</UTT>Some people will gamble on anything, it has to be an addiction.  I think I'll stick to reading my fantasy novel for entertainment.</UTT>I'll stick to daydreaming I live in South Africa, and have a car equipped with flame throwers. I can imagine the chaos if it were legal here.</UTT>I live in Ohio, so I daydream of warmer places all the time.  I just learned it's illegal to warm your car here, I guess I'm a criminal.</UTT>I'm in Ohio too, and dare a Summit County deputy to tell me I can't, lol. Have you been to Detroit, and Bell Island? The founder of Cadillac's home is there.</UTT>I've been to the airport and Ann Arbor, but never Detroit itself.  Soon it will be all self driving cars, I'm looking forward to that, then I can read as I go.</UTT>The Tesla has Atari games, I think I would prefer that. McDonalds used to be so innovative, I have to wonder what happened. They invented the drive-thru, to accomodate soldiers who were not permitted out of their cars while wearing fatigues.</UTT>It's often funny how something we take for granted came about for an odd reason.  Supposedly the Google self driving car has a aggressive mode.  So we'll still have road rage.</UTT>That doesn't surprise me at all.</UTT>Have a good day, nice speaking with you.

It shows voting is very important to the nation. Voting is the biggest gift to people in the democratic nation.</UTT>It's a shame that 34% of the black male population have permanently  lost the right to vote</UTT>It affects the entire democracy of the nation. Voting means people are also in the part of the government. People enjoy the vast power.</UTT>Yes, in the UK not all the men had the opportunity to vote until 1918</UTT>But today, all people have voting rights. It is the power of the people. Ordinary people can change the government.</UTT>They have the right to vote but not a lot of choices, since 1853 all presidents have been either republican or democrat</UTT>But people only choose the leader. In election campaigns all the party leaders canvas the people.</UTT>Yea, I guess it's better than appointing officials by lottery like they did in Ancient Athens</UTT>Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections. Election is the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.</UTT>Yea, it's a shame that voter turnout has breached 62.8% in  the past century</UTT>In 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states . It is very shameful to us. Real democracy is a transparent form of government.</UTT>Yea that is deplorable. It's strange that since 1900 the taller candidate has one the presidential election 75% of the time</UTT>It very crazy. Astrology can't work in guessing the election result.</UTT>No I guess not. It's also peculiar that the only presidents with beards were republicans</UTT>Republican party candidates have won most elections.</UTT>It's a shame that a Nixon or Bush has been on each winning Republican ticket since 1928</UTT>Yeah. Vice nice chatting with you. Have a great day.</UTT>Yea, you too, I'm gonna google some info about the Grand Ole Party</UTT>Ok. The Republican Party is one of the major political parties in US. It was founded in 1854 they took anti-slavery and pro-economic reform ideological stances.</UTT>Well I got to go, have a nice night

It's good for foodies too!</UTT>I will have to look that up.  I'm a big music fan.  Led Zeppelin decided not to title their fourth album to confuse the rock press. lol</UTT>Interesting! Did you ever listen to Hanson? They became the most requested track on a chicago alternative rock station because DJs didn't say who was singing.</UTT>I remember MMmmmbop. lol  That's a funny story.  AC/DC has 21 songs with the word "rock" in the title!</UTT>That is funny</UTT>Ohio is the only state to have an official rock song - "Hang on Sloopy"</UTT>Do you like Whitesnake? They had over 50 members in their history so that the list has its own Wikipedia page.</UTT>That's a lot of members!  The grammy awards were invented to counter the exploding popularity of rock n roll in the 1950's.</UTT>Funny. Did you ever play Sonic? He was supposed to be the member of a rock band originally and was going to have a blond haired human girlfriend named Madonna.</UTT>lol I never played it.  It came after my video game days. lol  That's interesting!  Termites eat through wood two times faster when listening to rock music.</UTT>Well that is weird. Wonder why that is! I'll have to Google that. I feel like I might have a clicking link addiction, that's a real addiction by the way.</UTT>Yikes!  I might have that too.  Astronauts on the international space station have faster internet than most Americans do at home!</UTT>Wow! And if we climb Mt. Everest we don't have to worry about losing service.

Like I learned that the moon on Jupiter would be considered a planet if it orbited around the sun.</UTT>I have to watch that doccumentary seems really interesting, there is a planet that has glass precipitations at a speed of 4500 mph!!</UTT>Glass precipitations at those speeds?! How do people survive in those climates? I wonder if those shards are visible via the Kepler Space Telescope. It was the telescope that discovered the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets that orbited the sun.</UTT>Well Im guessing its a planet without life, we would day in a matter of seconds thats a sure thing, you know astromers detected life already about 455 light years away</UTT>I'm confused about light-years, are those equivalent to a standard Earth year?</UTT>No, those are years traveling at the speed of light, so it would take 455 years to get to that place assuming we are travelling at that speed</UTT>Oh ok, I see. Thanks for clarifying that, 455 years is a lot of time! Considering that teens and a lot of people spend lots of time on social media platforms like Facebook as well. Can't believe MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for a mere $75 million in early 2005, and now MySpace is gone with the wind!</UTT>I bet they are kicking themselves in the head by now, they turn down the business idea of their lifes,</UTT>I know! Especially after Facebook went public in 2012, the company was valued at 104 billion! I think the social media giant is worth a lot more than that now considering they have about 2.2 billion monthly active users</UTT>Thats like paying a $1 to get $10000 in return!!! I heard the company makes most of their revenue by ads</UTT>That is a great investment, but rather a headache considering it has to abide to the customs and traditions of various parts of the world. Like in German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the "Like" button is actually illegal, I'm not sure why that is though.</UTT>Really its ilegal? I wonder why? doesnt seem like it can harm anybody,</UTT>Yeah, I'm not sure why, if anything it seems like a positivity button. Unlike Burger King which ran a promotion where if you unfriended 10 people on Facebook, you get a free whopper, that should be illegal</UTT>I agree thats like sabotaging a business although I would have taken advantage of that promotion, after all who doesnt like free burgers, Iceland is a country thats being influeced by Facebook at a political level</UTT>Yeah, I do like free burgers too but I wonder how Burger King would've checked that people held up their end of the bargain. How is Iceland being influenced by Facebook at a political level?</UTT>Maybe people had to unfriend their contacts in front of the cashier lol, it is a hard thing to prove, and they are rewritting their constitution with the feedback of citizens via Facebook</UTT>Yeah, I didn't hear of that promotion, I only hear promotions of concerts, but I have never attended one of Linkin Park's concerts even though they played 324 concerts in one year. Have you?</UTT>I have, I went to a Ramones concert a few years ago, they were on a big tour that lasted almost 20 years</UTT>20 years on the road, that seems quite tiring. On the bright side, it must mean that they had a performance and audience to perform to unlike the Pink Floyd who played to no audience</UTT>I wish I was in that Roman amphitheater, I wonde why he decided to record a concert without any audience, another band I used to like is Creed do you follow them?</UTT>I think it may have been for like a intermission performance at concerts, I think it's the only thing that makes sense. Yeah, I'm familiar with them but they had concert attendees sue them because of bad performance.</UTT>Yeah four of them even filled a lawsuit against the band I heard it was terrible, its a shame because the band used to be good</UTT>Yeah, I wonder what came out of the lawsuit, probably just an extortion attempt.</UTT>Yeah, I agree, I would just forget about the concert and drop it, it doesnt seem worth it to persue an action like that one.</UTT>Yeah me too, I get so hyper at concerts though.</UTT>I agree, I also get pshyched up, its amazing to be there and just listen to live music, its a unique experience for sure!</UTT>I know that if I was an early investor I would be just as psyched as well!</UTT>I agree,  well I hope I can attend a concert soon its been a long time, its expensive but I think that its worth attending one specially if the artist is good</UTT>Yeah, is there any one in particular that you enjoy?</UTT>Well I do like several artists, mostly latin music like Luis Miguel, what about you?</UTT>The most recent artist I saw live was Jessie J and it was at a warehouse venue, would be cool if it was at the roman amphitheater though.</UTT>I agree with you, the one in Croatia must be beautiful, a unique experience indeed.
t_db0c0b0a-1ea1-48a5-8415-b09f5f495ae9</CONV>Are you a football fan?</UTT>Yes I am how about you</UTT>I  am, coutning the hours till the game, do you have a favorite team in the NFL?</UTT>My fav is los angeles rams.</UTT>I see, mine are the Patriots, too bad the live gameplay is only of about 11 minutes</UTT>okay, My mom and dad is a physical director and sports coach. My brother is a basket ball player. I am not a player but i play volley ball and 400 meters runner</UTT>So sports runs in your blood lol too bad the NFL season is at its end.</UTT>Ha ha, yes it seems, will wait for the next season.. what you play for your fitness</UTT>I like to run and I also go to the gym. I like to play football with friends, I like the QB position.</UTT>Very nice to hear that. Do you like songs ?</UTT>I do like songs, mostly rap, I like the rapper Drake, what about you?</UTT>I love melody songs it melt my heart. songs are my best friends.</UTT>That is a good one I like One Dance, the second single of his album.</UTT>Superb, I am die hard fan of musician Illayaraja. If have time hear some songs from the list</UTT>I havent heard that musician before, hyou know that Drake graduated high school at age 25? I guess its never too late.</UTT>yes anyone can learn anytime, time is not a constraint, I love to learn new things everyday, I am currently studying currency trading</UTT>Thats great, keep up with your studies,if Alex Smith could do it I bet we can all find the time to study.</UTT>Yes I hope, am not aware quaterback, Its a new thing to me , Ill clarify some doubts from my dad</UTT>Well the Quarterback is the leader of the team, he touches the ball on every offensive play!</UTT>intresting, is kellan is the only left handed QB ?</UTT>I think he is, I cant recall anothe QB that is a leftie</UTT>okay, These articles were interesting to read.. hope you also enjoyed</UTT>Hope you had enjoyed them too, I have some interesting facts for  the upcoming Superbowl now.
t_d69f54de-c5c9-42bc-9911-6ff3cdeac718</CONV>Do you like Jazz?</UTT>Don't know much about it. You?</UTT>I do, I am a fan of the genre, it was originated in the 19th century, so its a genre with a lot of history</UTT>Did it originally come from African american communities in New Orleans?</UTT>It did yeah, its roots come from those communities, jazz is a mayor form of musical expression</UTT>Wow that's amazing. Are Jazz and blues the same or two different forms of musical expression?</UTT>I guess they are different, but had similarities, jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes</UTT>It began in new Orleans in the 1910's. they used brass band marching, right?</UTT>Yeah it did, cool jazz however developed by the 40s</UTT>Oh ok, i thought it might have something to do with what they call the roaring 20's. I hear Clint Eastwood was a fan.</UTT>He was, he actually played the piano in the movie Million Dollar Baby, so not only a great actor but a musician</UTT>Yeah I loved that movie, I don't remember that scene though. Apparently there is a Harlem women who has free jazz concerts at her apartment.</UTT>I thought that was a great movie as well, and that must be awesome, listening to Jazz music for free,</UTT>Yeah she done it every Sunday for the last 20 years and sometimes top performers stop by.</UTT>Awesome, her neighbors must love her or hate her if they want to sleep, so whats with jazz players and goatees!</UTT>Something about comfort but i don't get it. They say cool jazz didn't really start until the 40's, what do you think? earlier or later?</UTT>Later I would say, and yeah apparently they provide comfort to players while playing, they look weird though.</UTT>Wow! Hey did you know that there is a programming language and the ones that function have jazz-like harmonies?</UTT>No didnt know that, so jazz has a big influence on computers as well!! interesting</UTT>Apparently it's big in Pakistan as well. Have you heard about the Orchestra that they have there?</UTT>I have its a really good orchestra, they are topping the charts right now.
t_8befd6ff-3210-4371-8039-8b6e25fa9587</CONV>Do you remember hurricane Michael?</UTT>Vaguely. There's been so many recently. Was that Florida?</UTT>It was in Florida and hit the Panhandle on Oct 10 near Panama City.</UTT>I think I remember it better now. I think it did a lot of damage and essentially shut everything down. There was panic and looting if I remember correctly.</UTT>Yeah, it did. Apparently a lot of the people down there had to dig their homes out the surroundings.</UTT>That's terrible. This is totally off subject but do you have a Facebook account?</UTT>I don't. I got rid of it a long time ago, it became boring.</UTT>I'm thinking about it because it's just so toxic now. Did yo know that MySpace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million in 2005?</UTT>yeah, I can believe it. But if they had bought it, it may not have become the success it is today.</UTT>True. If it had stayed the same they made a terrible business decision. Do you know why Facebook's color scheme is primarily blue?</UTT>No, why? Is it because Zuck can't see properly?</UTT>It is. He has red-green colorblindness. It works for me though because I like the color scheme.</UTT>Interesting, does it say why instagram is designed the way it is?</UTT>No, I am unaware of why the design of instagram is the way it is. I find it very strange that there is a German state where the Facebook like button is illegal. What could possibly be the reasoning for that?</UTT>I'm not surprised, have you been to Germany?</UTT>I have not but I think it would be very fun. Did you hear about the Burger King promotion involving Facebook?</UTT>Yeah, I participated! Just kidding, but you have to wonder what BK has against facebook.</UTT>I was wondering the same thing. What could they possibly gain by rewarding people for unfriending people on Facebook?</UTT>I'm not sure, but it is a good marketing campaign to get attention I suppose. I mean heck, we are talking about it.</UTT>That's true. Completely off topic but do you find fish to be interesting?</UTT>Yeah, I'm a huge fan of fish. I had tropical fish when I was younger. Well, nice chatting with you!
t_cf84b428-d20c-408b-978d-ca877fb8b2ba</CONV>Seems like there is a lot to do in DC this weekend. There is a Renaissance Festival. Have you been to one of those?</UTT>I have not been to a Renaissance Festival, but I have seen snapchat and instagram stories of people dressing up in the Renaissance style.</UTT>Yeah, I haven't either but it seems fun. There is also an Outdoor Film Festival that raises money for charity.</UTT>It makes me want to join as well. However, I have no money for that to fly over there. I feel that some festivals would do that for charity. I believe it is under Comcast.</UTT>Yes, you're right. The screen is nine stories high and 52 feet wide. So you can watch  comfortably from anywhere on the lawn. They are going to play big hits like Black Panther and Lion King.</UTT>That is hard to believe. That is a big screen. I bet it is worth it because it is free. People can bring their chairs, food, and blankets to sit and relax on.</UTT>Yeah, I'd be sure to buy food and alcohol, ya know, to benefit the charities ;)</UTT>That is true. You got to treat yourself once in a while. I would be surprised that alcohol would be bought at this kind of festival, since it's a family friendly vibe.</UTT>Speaking of alcohol, there is also a Beer-Lympics taste test at the Renaissance Hotel.</UTT>Really? I would definitely go there. Hopefully they have Modelo!</UTT>Sorry, I meant Glen's Garden Market. Maybe you can get some Modelo while going to the world's largest bachata festival! That is at the Renaissance hotel.</UTT>How much is the entrance fee?</UTT>I believe it is free but local draft beers are $4 all night.</UTT>That makes sense. What other activities does the Beer-lympics Festival have besides the drinking?</UTT>You can do beer trivia.</UTT>That seems difficult. I would only enjoy the drink than the games then. Are there certain performances?</UTT>I don't think so. However, at the bachata festival, you can do workshops, watch performances and listen to concerts. There will also be salsa, zouk and samba. Do you dance?</UTT>What kind of workshops? Those dances sound like a workout. I used to dance Tahitian and Hawaiian. However, if I had the time, I would try to join and learn some samba.</UTT>Hmm, not sure what kind of workshops but maybe you can learn new types of dance. The daytime events are for profesional dancers but at night they are open for everyone.</UTT>Do you know who will be instructing the dances?</UTT>I'm not sure but there will be some performances by well known dancers!
t_6d11bace-e95b-4d5a-bf03-a5dc38d7853a</CONV>do you watch tv?</UTT>I do quite a bit. Do you watch the SNL?</UTT>Sometimes, do you have a favorite skit. Did you ever watch the SImpsons?</UTT>I love the Weekend Update and it is also the longest running skit there. Yes I watch them sometimes</UTT>There is an episode where Bart does not appear at all</UTT>Wow is he not a huge part of the show though?</UTT>Yes that is why is is weird that he was not even mentioned in it</UTT>Wow. Did you know Daniel Radcliff was the voice of Edward CUllen in the simpsons parody?</UTT>Cool. How about that 70s show?</UTT>I have seen some episodes, they are pretty good</UTT>Yeah but in the UK it flopped after just 10 episode as they made it verbatim</UTT>Wow that is too bad. Did you know only one of shakespeare's plays has not been adapted to TV?</UTT>Hmm which one is that? Do you use your phone much?</UTT>It is the Two Noble KInsmes. Yes all the time</UTT>Do you know why the NY area code is 212?</UTT>I have no idea, why is that?</UTT>It is because it was easy ti dial on a rotary phone</UTT>Oh wow cool. DO you know who invented the dial phone and why?</UTT>I am not sure of that, bet is a cool story?</UTT>Yes it was an undertaker why though the phone companies were rerouting his calls to the competitors. It was nice chatting with you.</UTT>same here, have a great day
t_c2ba1f69-a7c5-4bf9-9b0c-8a66fe87c321</CONV>Are you aware that the taller candidate for president has won 75% of the elections of them time.</UTT>Hello - it doesn't surprise me. I've even heard that taller people in interviews for jobs tend to get the job more often.</UTT>Crazy, is that true?</UTT>Not sure how true it is, but that's what I've been told. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college?</UTT>I'm not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor?</UTT>Wow that's crazy. I can't imagine traveling that far for work.</UTT>Me either. Did you know Tim Leary ran for governor of CA?</UTT>I did not know that, but that's interesting. I didn't know congress has played a democrat vs. republican baseball game every year since 1909.</UTT>I did, it must be one boring game!</UTT>Yea I bet it is a very boring game. A cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election once before.</UTT>I can believe it. Did you know Nevada is the only stat that has a none of these candidates as a voting option?</UTT>Wow I didn't know that about Nevada.</UTT>Yeah, must be an interesting state to live in. Have you ever visited there?</UTT>I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you?</UTT>Yeah, I've been. But I don't think a majority of the people that visit there vote.</UTT>Yea, I'm not too sure on that. I saw that all elections conducted in Oregon are conducted by mail.</UTT>Interesting. It rains a lot in Oregon, have you ever visited?</UTT>Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get.</UTT>Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of rainy states to be honest.</UTT>Me either. Did you know the government of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool?</UTT>No, weird. Is a hew a professional swimmer?
t_d9fcc31e-0381-4bb7-ac8f-5be70b6695b1</CONV>hi how are you? are you a fan of golf?</UTT>Well, yes in a way. I played a lot of golf, probably 2 or 3 times a week college through the birth of my son, after that I kind of got away from the game as both a player and fan so only follow golf from a distance.</UTT>I never played. it always seemed too expensive. all the equipment and greens fees and stuf.</UTT>Yes, that why world wide soccer makes more money than football, basketball and the rest of professional American sports combined. In a poor country they can afford goals and a ball, where football equipment for each player or golf equipment is prohibitively expensive.</UTT>yeah, soccer is the democratic game. poor kids with a ball can play on the beach. i loved to play as a kid. i dint need nothing but a ball.</UTT>Well, i grew up in the Midwest so it was Football/Basketball/Baseball as soccer was looked on as something foreign in 1978. By the time my son was in high school and living on the east coast it was an accepted varsity sport. Speaking of golf, did you read where Kim Jong-Il according to North Korea press has only golfed one time in his life and had 11 holes-in-on on the 18 holes. I"m sure that is totally true and a record that will never be broken.</UTT>yes, i bet he set every record that was possible in golf. he probably was the best player ever. I grew up on the west coast and soccer was common. i like it because you didnt need to be tall or muscular.</UTT>Well, the coasts were always ahead of the Midwest, I was in the last class in college to program with punch cards, but that will date me. I read where Antarctica has a disc golf course, one wonders if it's open year around and if penguin get in the way like ducks and geese do on standard courses since they always have lots of lakes and food along the fairways.</UTT>the antarctica course is one of the trickiest. many golfers have died on the course, and that is the challenge: can you survive, or will you end up penguin food?</UTT>That puts an added dimension to a non-contact sport like golf, I'm surprised it not televised on Fox. Are you a football fan, my old landlord loved the Steeler's and he'd be delighted to know Ben Roethlisberger has the most wins at Cleveland Stadium even over Cleveland quarterbacks. The world would stop on Sunday for him to watch the Steelers from our condo in New Jersey. Are you a football fan have a team out there?</UTT>I do not watch football much these days. i try to catch the playoffs and the super bowl. You?</UTT>Well, I lived in Kansas City for a decade and had season tickets at Arrowhead and now live near Boston so there's the whole Patriot thing so for Chiefs i'm a fan and Patriots when the locals do well I get cheap/free drinks so I'm a fan once removed. Arrowhead is a great time, but that first NFL Playoff game in 1932 was an 80 yard dirt field inside Chicago Stadium shows just how recent football is in the US, now they don't get a 80 yard dirt track in a hockey stadium but a multi-billion dollar stadium funded usually by the local city not the owner.</UTT>yeah, the NFL has its humble beginnings. it has come a long way. now the players are stars and they make serious bank.</UTT>I get a lot of heck here in Boston as the Patriots won the last Superbowl, the Chiefs last Superbowl was when Nixon was President but I still where Red. Interesting up until 1978 tennis players could use any object as a racket, have you ever seen a list of objects used? I have to think there were a few creative attempts at getting an advantage in the early days of Professional Tennis.</UTT>i guess. i dont know much about tennis. i suppose that players could try to get an advantage but in the end it is about playing ability and coaching i would say.</UTT>Yes, I would agree with you. We talk about the budget deficit we passing on to our kids, but did you see the US Military operates 234 gold courses world-wide at a cost of $140,000,000. I'd think if we got serious about balancing the budge there's some some room there to pare back the expenses.</UTT>perhaps but the military runs on golf. major decisions are made on the course. nothing can get done without officers drinking and golfing.</UTT>Haha, yes, we might be crippled if we didn't have them. Speaking of low cost sports, I must be a luddite. Did you know the official name of the game I call ping pong is actually Table Tennis and ping pong is actually sells table tennis equipment. I've been calling it by the wrong name all these years.</UTT>i did not know that. that is a name that makes sense. table tennis. ok. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Yes thank you for the chat, and if you take up golf, avoid that Australasian course with bull sharks in the water hazards. One errant shot and you might lose a leg.</UTT>i will take heed of the ozzie courses. that is a good tip. thanks! have a good evening.</UTT>Thanks you too.</UTT>See you!</UTT>Yes, au revior!

Or like country music?</UTT>I don't watch it but I do know Blake Shelton is on The Voice</UTT>I don't watch it either, but evidently Blake Shelton is pretty good, nothing like the legend George Strait, though.</UTT>It's odd there are only 2 African Americans in the country music hall of fame</UTT>Yes, especially considering country comes from folk and the blues.</UTT>Its interesting country was influenced by Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, I'd never figure</UTT>I think it's funny the U2 convinced a crowd in Galveston once they were a country band called The Dalton Brothers.</UTT>Yea, U2 must of been using some good wigs and costumes to pull that off</UTT>I'm not a huge country fan, but about 10 years ago, it was the most listened to music listened to in cars during rush hour traffic.</UTT>Me neither unless I've been drinking, apparently the Fender Stratocaster was intended for country music</UTT>I wonder why that is?</UTT>I'm not sure. Do you like drama? Hugh Laurie makes 700000 an episode for House</UTT>I loved that show. Do you know Jon Hamm from Mad Men? He used to be a drama teacher!</UTT>Yea, he taught drama to Ellie Kemper from the office</UTT>How funny. Evidently, Michael Caine became an actor because of all the prettiest girls were in his drama class.</UTT>Lol Michael Caine is pretty smart</UTT>So is Jim Carrey. He won't do any roles unless the message is positivity.</UTT>That's a shame. Did you know it's impossible to separate 2 phonebooks that have their pages overlapped?</UTT>That's interesting. Can you believe how broad Drama is? It encompasses so many mediums, even the radio.</UTT>I hear there's a website that broadcasts thousand of episodes of classic radio dramas for free</UTT>That's pretty cool. Apparently, the earliest work of drama was Aristotle's Poetics from 335 BC.
t_c7d1572f-7a0b-4131-899e-6105ea9fcf5a</CONV>Hello.  Are you a fan of baseball?</UTT>Hi! I am not, but I was an athlete, so I do appreciate stories about comebacks from injuries.</UTT>With pro ball players playing over 150 games a year, it's not a surprise that some get injured.  That they can come back just a strong is usually a surprise to me.</UTT>I do think the offseason can go either way in terms of bringing back a fit or out of shape player, depending on the level of motivation. It seems like Harper is very motivated.</UTT>After missing out on 40 games, and coming back to be in the post season, I would hope so.  He's a good player, but with his focus and strength, it wouldn't be a surprise if he picked up another NL MVP award.</UTT>IT probably</UTT>Personally, if I was in Gallo's shoes, I would harass him as well.  It's hard to beat Harper in the HR count.  A win is a win, even if it was only because he was injured for a quarter of the season!</UTT>Agreed. The motivation from a friendly rivalry can be just as productive as a hostile one when it comes to achievements.</UTT>I was surprised to learn that Gallo and Harper have known each other since they were kids.</UTT>Yes, most of the time you lose a lot of companions on the way to the top because there's not room for everyone.</UTT>But, having a friend at the top with you can help people know your non-professional, non-interview side.  Gallo would be the one to tell people how fun Harper can be.</UTT>Yes, plus celebrity golf invitationals help for PR!</UTT>I think it would be fun to play with someone like Phelps.  Growing up a swimmer, I know the personality type.</UTT>I was a swimmer, too! I've been on Phelps on deck before...he lies about his height lol. Given how awkward he is on land, I'm not sure he'd be very good at golf, but it could be fun to watch how he handles it.</UTT>The ones I knew who could do fly sank like a rock with breast.  But neither equates to golf.    VanDyken was my personal know.  She was great at overplaying her sportsmanship qualities.  :)</UTT>Van Dyken definitely has a reputation as a b*tch within the elite swimming community, but she was definitely a competitor in her glory days. It's too bad for her that she didn't see the comeback fire of someone like Dara Torres and use that to get back to the top in 2000.</UTT>I thought I had heard that she went to one of the pro-am tournaments for golf at some point as well.  Had she not been seriously injured, it could have been a Phelps/VanDyken golf tourney.</UTT>Well, in my opinion, her comeback to everyday life as paraplegic is more inspiring than recovering from a run-of-the-mill sports injury like Bryce Hunter.</UTT>I definitely agree with that.  Minor injuries in baseball happen all the time.  Some require surgery, some don't.  But, they're so well known, they can be fixed for the most part.  There's no fully coming back from a back break.</UTT>Yes, especially since even though baseball is demanding in terms of time, it does not ruin your body  or brain the way some other sports like football can. I don't think molestation or eating disorders are common in the sport, either.</UTT>At least, not in the MLB.  I would suspect that would be more common in the softball world, or in female oriented professional sports.</UTT>Well, the disparity of proper treatment for females in sports isn't just physical, it's professional, too, in the sense that there's literally one pro spectator sport in the world where women are considered professionally equal to men (tennis).</UTT>I would love to see women in MLB.  While I don't think wide adoption could ever be possible in football, baseball has no real reason why they would be completely excluded, and would be the most likely to break that barrier.

Im doing great. The Pats won this time against LA, right? i didnt watch the game.</UTT>Yea this year but last year they lost to eagles, even with Rob Gronkowski playing the entire game</UTT>The bowl last year was pretty good. there was a big comeback at the end, right?</UTT>I think there were quite a few lead changes throughout the game and I believe it was Brady's 8th super bowl apperance</UTT>He has six rings now? The man is a legend. he is not my favorite, but i understand why people like him.</UTT>Yea, he's accomplished a lot which is pretty amazing considering he was drafted in the sixth round of the draft</UTT>nobody really understood his potential. and with Bill, he has found his place. those two have a few years left.</UTT>Yea, Brady has really grown with Bill and really advanced in 2007 when he threw for 50 tds that season</UTT>he probably had some great receivers to help him out with that.</UTT>Yea, in 2007 he did have Randy Moss on the team to throw to</UTT>And Gronk? he is the other guy? when did he start playing?</UTT>I don't think he played with Brady until 2010</UTT>Ok. Brady and Gronk seem to be wired together. Plus BIll B has some ungodly sense of the game.</UTT>Yea and a sense of humor, Belichick always lists Brady on the injury report every week despite Brady never missing a game</UTT>Bill is trying to put the other team off balance. but crying wolf stops working eventually. LOL</UTT>Yea, Belichick is much better than Brady's jv coach who never started him despite the team never winning a game</UTT>what was up with that guy? he must have played favorites. it makes no sense.</UTT>Who knows, maybe his grandfather was the head coach of Cumberland when they lost to Georgia Tech by 222 points</UTT>what was the GT coach thinking? that is quite cruel. anyway, great chat!</UTT>Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
t_d3b7fb1b-90e9-44e2-9d91-594b8ab7f3a9</CONV>Have you heard about the red mass? Apparently it's a special mass that they hold for the Supreme Court</UTT>Yes, held in DC at St. Matthew's Cathedral. Seems to have been controversial mass this year. What do you think?</UTT>Yes it seems very controversial especially since they were trying to confirm Kavanaugh at the time. Have you ever visited the United States Senate before</UTT>The Senate chambers? No. Never was inside St. Matthews, either. Do know Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault by h.s. classmate in '80's. Don't know where that allegation stands. Do you?</UTT>No I think they determined it didn't happen, but I'm not a hundred percent sure on that it's crazy that there is a candy drawer in the Senate with unlimited candy LOL I want some of the Milky Way is right now</UTT>Been there since '68. Maybe the jellybeans are an homage to Ronald Reagan, who kept a jar on his desk. Have you ever witnessed a Senate session?</UTT>No I haven't. I only know that there are two senators per state so there are a total of 100 senators in the chamber</UTT>Right. Powerful chamber of Congress since 1789. Did you know Nixon cracked the gavel that had been used for 165 years. Heard about that?</UTT>Haha I did hear about that that's very sad because that is a good history that the gavel had, what do you think about why Michael Jordan would not endorse a Democratic candidate? I think it was smart that he never picked a side with politics</UTT>Yeah, but savvy to say, Republicans buy shoes, too". His $$$ sponsor, Nike, must have loved that.</UTT>Yep it's better if celebrities just don't get involved, but I was shocked to learn that women could not wear pants in the Senate until about the year 1993, that seems very stupid</UTT>Agree. In 1993, 1st lady Hillary C. was occasionally wearing pantsuits. Trend change, and celebs affect those changes....Agree?</UTT>Yep I could agree with that. What do you think about the top three most wealthy presidents though? Shocking that Trump is not one of them</UTT>We don't know. He wont make his tax returns public. Fishy.  Washington & Jefferson made $$ as slave owners. JFK's wealth was built on his father's businesses, especially liquor sales. JFK submitted tax returns, though.</UTT>Yep that's true. I wonder if president banana of Zimbabwe is Rich from bananas LOL maybe we should see his tax returns</UTT>LOL for President Banana!</UTT>What do you think about the president of Indonesia by the way? Maybe he is Rich from the three pop albums that he wrote while in office to LOL</UTT>Heard about that. If referring to the current Pres., I don't know much about him.</UTT>Yeah I don't know much about him unfortunately, I do know that we used to have a different role for vice presidents, did you hear about the rule change back in 1805?</UTT>Sort of recall. Jefferson was re-elected in 1804, but think the runner-up may have been James Madison. Now, at least, we can vote for a ticket, Pres. & VP candidates. Better, don't you think?</UTT>Yep I think it's better this way. Emagine with President Trump and vice president Hillary Clinton, you would have so much drama
t_2d27b1e0-428a-4443-8794-3544fed8e57b</CONV>Hello there, how are you doing today?  Are you a big rap fan?</UTT>Yeah I listen to the songs from the 90s. I never knew that it was influenced by ancient Egyptian practices</UTT>Nice, yeah I like early to mid 90's rap the best.  And that is awesome, I never knew that.</UTT>Yea, I guess the first rapper was DJ Hollywood from Harlem, I didn't know that</UTT>Anthony Holloway, he was probably a super cool person.</UTT>I'm a big Tupac fan, nice to see his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance</UTT>Yeah Tupac was really good, and that is a very cool fact about him I would agree.</UTT>Yeah, I like eminem too, I guess it's a good thing he never became a comic book artist.</UTT>Yeah imagine if he would've been a pro comic book artist? Wonder what type he would have written?</UTT>Well his favorite superhero is Spiderman, so maybe he could work on that</UTT>Yeah I'm sure he would give that a try if someone asked.  Did you know a Michigan judge once rapped a ruling in a suit vs. Eminem?</UTT>Lol, that's kinda unprofessional. I wondered what he was arrested for, maybe he equipped a flame thrower to his car like it's legal to do in South Africa</UTT>Yeah that sounds like a real life grand theft auto, or better yet a real life twisted metal, do you remember that game?</UTT>Yea, it was pretty fun. I wonder if there's any jobs you can get for beating 90,000 people like Jann Mardenborough did in Gran Turismo to become a professional race car driver</UTT>Yeah I wonder what other jobs there are out there, wonder if I could get a pro football contract from playing FIFA? lol</UTT>Lol that be cool. Apparently you can hear radio storms from jupiter from a regular radio</UTT>Very interesting.  I also know that there is a website where you can listen to tons of old radio dramas for free.</UTT>That's interesting, I wonder if they are forced to have at least 40% of the shows be from canadian artists</UTT>Yeah like in Canada, I don't think everyone would agree that is a good law, but maybe the Canadian musicians would.</UTT>Well I guess it's better than listening to a program in classical latin like 'nutil latini' in Finland</UTT>Yeah I would have to agree with you on that one for sure.  Well it was nice talking with you today, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day.
t_3f305506-61e6-4a45-b0ea-0209a6ddf0d7</CONV>Hey do you like music? I think jazz is cool because it has such a rich cultural history.</UTT>I do, and in fact Jazz is one of my favorite genres, so relaxing, I just love it</UTT>Oh nice. You ever been to New Orleans. Jazz began as early as 1910 there!</UTT>Jazz has a lot of inlfuence on our culture even on computers, theres a programming language written in musical composition, based on jazz</UTT>Oh wow interesting. Clint Eastwood is also a jazz enthusiast, pianist, and he even scored several films!</UTT>Yeah I think I saw him play the piano in the movie, Million Dollar Baby</UTT>Yeah I loved that movie. Pakistan apparently has a chart topping jazz orchestra!</UTT>It seems like they have a great orchestra, and what about those goatees? they look kind of odd and seem to be a trend in Jazz players</UTT>Oh yeah so many people have them. I wonder if they actually provide more comfort when playing. I guess it makes sense.</UTT>I guess theres only one way to find out, I have to grow a goatee and learn how to play the trumpet</UTT>And you have to let me know how that goes! Lots of people enjoy dancing to jazz music. Babies for example spontaneously dance when they hear music!</UTT>I will, maybe you can grow a goatee as well and we can form our own jazz group and then an orchestra</UTT>Yeah that would be hilarious. There are a few people who are good dancers that I wouldn't expect like Bruce Lee and Tupac.</UTT>Tupac is a dancer? that is new to me,</UTT>Yeah me too. He did ballet in high school and was in the nutcracker!</UTT>Ballet dancer Tupac? I wonder if he got teased over that</UTT>Probably why he never mentioned it. Ballet dancers can go through up to 4 shoes in a week!</UTT>Thats a lot of money for shoes, Im guessing those shoes arent cheap maybe they buy tons of them and get discounts</UTT>Yeah I bet they are pretty expensive. Dance is great though, very aesthetic with symbolic value.</UTT>Babies love to dance, they spontaneously dance when they hear music</UTT>Haha that is so cool! I'm gonna go watch some fox news now! abbreviated FNC.
t_bc06386e-e0b1-466f-b3a3-c189b1d81825</CONV>Hello. I love good weather all thanks to the sun! It is a perfect sphere of hot plasma!</UTT>Me too. I saw that the sun is actually really white.</UTT>Yes you're correct but it only appears yellow because of atmospheric scattering.</UTT>Very cool. Did you know a lightening bolt is actually 5 times hotter than the surface of the sun?</UTT>I hope I never get struck by one! Surprisingly the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star in our galaxy.</UTT>Me either lol. That's pretty small then in comparison to the other stars. I would have never imagined that.</UTT>Yes me too. The sun is definitely the most important source of energy for life on earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system.</UTT>Definitely. It produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of our planet for 500,000 years which is amazing.</UTT>That is so cool. It makes sense though since the mass of the sun is about 330,000 times that of earth.</UTT>For sure. Do you like animals?</UTT>Yes I love animals. There have been around 1.5 million species described, so plenty for everyone to have a favorite!</UTT>That's a lot of species. I saw there are 20 quintillion animals on Earth.</UTT>That is amazing and I can't even fathom that much. The study of animals is called zoology and they must be busy with all those animals!</UTT>For sure. Animals get white patches on their heads when they are domesticated.</UTT>Oh maybe that explains why there are so many white patches on dogs. If you are annoyed when you get hiccups just remember they are a hold over from early evolution.</UTT>Definitely. That's interesting about hiccups. That would have been so cool to have lungs and gills.</UTT>Yes I would love to breathe underwater. The country of Scotland has a protection act against the Loch Ness monster. Do you think it exists?</UTT>That would be awesome to breathe underwater. That's hilarious for something that might not even exist.</UTT>Yes I think so too. And this happened all in 1912! Well it was great chatting with you.</UTT>Animals are pretty fascinating to study. It was good chatting with you too!</UTT>Have a good one!
t_82a20251-ab26-4bc0-8fe4-fb76867c2359</CONV>Hilarious that Fox News tried to sue the Simpsons for parodying it. I suppose Ailes didn't understand the Streisand Effect, perhaps due to the fact that he's an older guy and not super familiar with the internet.</UTT>Not a huge fan of Fox News. Even more surprising that they're more watched than CNN and MSNBC combined.</UTT>Yeah, I don't like them. But their audience is disproportionately older, patriotic guys in the southwest- hopefully they'll be less of a prominent demographic in the coming years.</UTT>Their audience is also largely republican, so not sure about that since there are many young republicans in the U.S.</UTT>Yeah, but not nearly as many as in the older generations. I saw an electoral map of how 2016 would've turned out with only Millennial voters, and it was almost solid blue except for a handful of states like Alabama and Utah.</UTT>That's reassuring. There are way more Trump supporters in the U.S. today than I'm personally comfortable with.</UTT>My feelings exactly. Especially when the presidency has glommed onto so much unconstitutional power under both party administrations.</UTT>Would agree 100%. I'm not a big fan of our president, but Indonesia's president seems cool. I guess that guy released 3 pop albums while in office!</UTT>I should Google that to see if they were any good.</UTT>I'm sure they're better than anything our president would put out!</UTT>He was accompanied by Lee Greenwood at CPAC -- plus the burnt steak, gilded baroque chairs, etc -- so his taste differs from mine significantly.</UTT>Can you imagine turning on the radio and hearing your president singing?</UTT>In the current situation, I'd rather not. I suspect the figures about the three wealthiest presidents weren't updated for Trump.</UTT>Hmm, not sure. I think the wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.</UTT>Yeah, I saw that -- but I think those figures are outdated. I don't think any of them would've been billionaires even in today's dollars.</UTT>Maybe the figures took inflation into account. Who knows? Although, a lot has changed in politics since the 17th and 18th centuries.</UTT>Yeah, the funny thing is "president" was in use as the title for weak executives, at the time it was adopted in the US constitution.</UTT>How interesting. Did you know that in the early 19th century, the runner up of the election became the VP? Imagine a Trump/Clinton duo.</UTT>Hopefully the administration would be too disorganized to do anything bad, LOL.</UTT>The current administration is scary. I listen to the radio on my way into work every morning, and the things that I hear are so disturbing!</UTT>Yeah, every day Twitter and my news feeds are full of horrible stuff. Hopefully his days are numbered. Nice chatting!
t_a915340f-b635-47d9-9888-fb477245f44f</CONV>Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.i did not know that! Did you?</UTT>No I didn't even know our radio waves were affected by other planets. What other crazy facts do you know about the radio.</UTT>by canadian law, all radios are required to have at least 40% of the music played be canadian</UTT>Are you serious? So there isnt too much variety in Canada is there. How old is radio?</UTT>right its a funny law! the radio has been aroubd since wwii. No one knows a forsure time or year!</UTT>Do know if the radio is available everywhere or are there certain parts of the world where it cant reach.</UTT>i think it is actually everywhere! So did you know Bruce lee was also a great dancer and he won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958.</UTT>Are you serious? Bruce lee is one of my martial arts idols. Have you ever seen comedian Joey Diaz talk about bruce lee on youtube</UTT>also 2pac did ballet in high school and was actually very good I already knew that though I'm a huge Tupac fan and has done so much research. I've never seen Joey Diaz I will check it out</UTT>I also love tupac did you know he wasn't even born in california?</UTT>yep there's so much stuff about him i love! i hope hes still alive</UTT>He could be. I didn't think the film the made about him was made well enough it should have been way better</UTT>i agree he is better then they portrayed sadly. he was also in the nutcracker ballet</UTT>He was also a backround dancer for the group digital underground when he first started his career.</UTT>yes that was his first tour! do you know much anout telephone history?</UTT>I know that the telephone was invented by alexander graham bell but I dont know too much else about its history</UTT>New York area code became 212 because it was easiest to dial on old spin phones . How cool!</UTT>Do you think this is still currently the area code for new york or it might have changed</UTT>it's still the same i received  BY call just the other day</UTT>Do you know the area code for los angeles?</UTT>i do not know! also UNICEF donates fresh water to people I  need everytime you don't use your phone. Not sure what that intakes though</UTT>Unicef are an example of a organization that aims to help people worldwide.
t_7292c7ef-cf54-4443-b3fb-6413524fa275</CONV>Do you like reading?</UTT>Hello there, I do like to read but wish I had more time to do more.  How about you?</UTT>I like to read but I'm sooo slow at it. I wish I could speed read sometimes. Can you speed read?</UTT>No I can't, but do you know how many words per minute the fastest reader can read?</UTT>I think it's 4,700 wpm and it's a record held by a lady to boot!</UTT>Holy cow! I don't understand how anyone could make sense of that many words that quickly.</UTT>Me neither! I wonder what kind of books she practices with. What types of books do you like to read?</UTT>I like history and mostly factual books, but I also like fantasy, Tolkien was really good.  How about you?</UTT>I think I like non-fiction the best too. I order a lot of cooking books off amazon, because they deliver so fast. Did you know they have a special deal with the postal service for sunday delivery?</UTT>Yeah cooking books are really helpful.  And yeah I think I read about that, very interesting.</UTT>Do you ever read poetry?</UTT>I do but not too much, how about you, do you have a favorite author?</UTT>I like a lot of food writers but you mentioned you liked Tolkein. Did you know that he and Cs Lewis used to read bad poetry to each other and play "you laugh you lose"?</UTT>I think that is hilarious that they did!  Oh to be a fly on the wall watching those two go at it would be gold!</UTT>I'd love to learn how to read braille, I wonder if the translation is any different because things like sign language tend to be similar to short hand</UTT>That would be very cool to learn how to do that, I give all the respect in the world to those that have to read like that.</UTT>If you think about it braille is around all kinds of places though so once you got started I might be easy to practice</UTT>Yeah I bet you could practice most places that you go.</UTT>I've never seen a book in braille though, I wonder how they maintain all the bumps</UTT>I don't think I have either, I just wonder how they get started learning that, like where do you start?</UTT>For those who can hear I guess there's just a lot of conversation about it maybe? Or could it be like learning to play an instrument?</UTT>Yeah that is probably true.  Well it was nice chatting with you, I hope you have a good day!
t_f30c161d-9e49-4fa8-9fd5-56692e698873</CONV>Do you like Justin Timberlake?  He has a tour called "Man of the Woods"?</UTT>I have never been that huge of a fan, but I have heard his concerts are amazing.  I remember watching the HBO special of his Madison Square Garden show.  Are you a fan?</UTT>No, I'm not.  I don't dislike him however... I guess people aren't quite buying his re-branding.  One said, "all the flannel in the world couldn't warm critical reception to the tour."</UTT>Haha, that is a great line.  I think he became a lot more personable after marrying Jessica Biel.  He has definitely come a long way from Nipplegate.</UTT>Ha.  He seems to be more effect.  Many think he should stick to his hits and not try to change too much.</UTT>I have heard some call his new tour empty, but that "many people enjoy empty fun."  Sounds poignant, but also a shot at society!</UTT>I think the detractors mainly don't like the theme and think he should do shows as he has always done.</UTT>Yes, people love the old stuff in general.  One of the best-selling albums of 2014 was Dark Side of the Moon.  Over 40 years after being initially released!</UTT>Yes, it's a classic.  Pink Floyd is different.  They turned a houseboat into a floating recording studio on the river Thames.</UTT>Haha, yup they are awesome.  I was a being fan of Linkin Park.  Very sad to hear what happened to them after having one of the best selling album's of the 21st century.</UTT>What happened to them?  I know "Hybrid Theory" was the album of which you speak.</UTT>*Big fan I meant.  The lead singer passed away recently.</UTT>Oh, sorry to hear that.  On a lighter note, two identical twins in Japan released a rap album when they turned 100 in 1992.</UTT>That is remarkable!  Sounds about as wild as the president of Indonesia releasing 3 pop albums while in office!</UTT>Yes, as wild as scientist voting the song "We are the Champions" as the catchiest song of all time.  I miss Freddy...</UTT>Me too :(  Those were the good old days.  When Eddie Van Halen literally set fire to the speakers when recording "Beat It."</UTT>His amp must have gone to "11" like in the movie Spinal Tap.  Funny, Ricky Gervals was a pop singer in the 1980's.</UTT>I cannot picture that!  They all have interesting quirks.  LIke Brian May using coins instead of guitar picks.</UTT>Or Matthew Bellamy from Muse destroying so many guitars.  Sad, he should donate them to a good cause.  That's been done, move on...</UTT>I agree.  He actually owns the Guinness world record for most guitars smashed!  Not ideal!</UTT>I agree.  Do something unique at least.  I think the Who did that, Hendrix set one on fire... Old news.</UTT>Yup, I am with you!  It was a pleasure chatting today!

I also wanted to point out that the only left handed quarterback in the NFL is Kellan Moore</UTT>Really is Kellan Moore the only left handed quarterback? What tean does he play for?</UTT>He has played a total of six seasons for the cowboys and the Detroit lions.</UTT>Oh i did not know that. Did he ever start a game?</UTT>I am not sure. The circular huddle used in the NFL was invented so the opposing team could not see the hand signals.</UTT>Wow thats amazing. Did you know the highest score in a football game ever was 222-0?</UTT>I feel very bad for the team that lost by 222 points. It was Georgia tech that defeated Cumberland right?</UTT>Yes it was. You have such good football knowledge.  Which football quarterback has the most consecutive starts?</UTT>I am actually not sure on that one. Was it Tom Brady? I am not sure, who was it?</UTT>Well it was Brett Favre. Did you know  Bruce Lee was a great dancer?</UTT>I never imagined Bruce Lee to be a dancer until I learned that he won the kong cha cha championship back in 1958!</UTT>Did you know when Bruce Lee was a baby he would spontaneously dance when he heard music, and he smiled more when he hit the beat?</UTT>No I did not. Professional ballet dancers can go through up to four pairs of ballet shoes a week!</UTT>That is true. Did you know Tupac danced ballet in high school?</UTT>He was a ballet dancer that portrayed the mouse king in the nutcracker right?</UTT>That is right. I never would have thought that tough ex gang member rapper Tupac danced ballet.</UTT>Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that can be used to achieve a lot of lean.</UTT>Was that a lean he did in some of his dance moves?</UTT>Yep, I was always wondering how he achieved those.</UTT>What is the most popular sport in the world?</UTT>I belive that it is soccer (or football)</UTT>That is correct. Have you ever played soccer?</UTT>I sometimes do. what about you?</UTT>No but i have played football.</UTT>Ah, so have I. Anyways, I have to go now. Thank you for the wonderful chat!

Did you know that the seahorse is the only fish to have a neck?</UTT>That is so interesting, I did not know that, but makes sense. I don't know if you like jelly fish or not but there is one that is immortal</UTT>Yeah, I've heard that. I'm not sure how that is possible.</UTT>Right, what if you blend it or do other things to it, it just won't die?</UTT>I'm not sure. It will probably die. I think it is a lie.</UTT>I think so too lol. I wouldn't mess with the black swallower fish though, it can eat prey twice its length</UTT>Yeah, can it eat a human though?</UTT>I doubt it lol, but I never want to find out either! It can eat 10x its weight so who knows</UTT>Ever listen to jazz?</UTT>I love jazz music, it has been around so long, how about you</UTT>I do. Apparently so does Clint Eastwood. He is a lifelong Jazz enthusiast.</UTT>That makes sense, it seems that at the end of most of his movies has jazz playing. I wonder if his new movie will have the same</UTT>I'm not sure. Interesting because today is Fat Tuesday. I just realized that.</UTT>wow I did now that either! That gives me an excuse to pig out and listen to jazz! I wonder if pakistan will celebrate, they have some good jazz bands there also</UTT>I heard that too. Apparently the trumpeters grow goatees to provide comfort when playing.</UTT>Nice, that gives me an excuse to grow one. I will tell my wife I will be playing jazz and it is required!</UTT>Hilarious! What about fantasy spelling bees, any interest?</UTT>I heard about that lol, that would be interesting. I think people need to call 1800 BETS OFF if they are playing fantasy for that lol!</UTT>Yeah, pretty crazy. Well nice chatting.

There is something for everyone, even for people who like Justin Bieber.</UTT>Yep, that is even how he got noticed was through youtube!</UTT>Although, people didnt care too much for his Baby, its the most disliked video.</UTT>Yea, do you blame people but they still wanted to watch his youtube video though haha</UTT>true, cant argue that point!</UTT>Did you also know that there are 70 full episodes of The joy of painting on youtube also, i loved Bob Ross</UTT>There is?  That would be awesome.  He is pretty iconic, painting those happy little trees.</UTT>Yeah, he has his own channel dedicated to those happy trees!</UTT>I might have to check that out, see if I can paint along with him.</UTT>Cool, i'm sure he will be happy if you did!</UTT>Netflix and youtube together make up half of peak internet traffic.</UTT>That's pretty interesting since Youtube and Netflix are internet based companies!</UTT>I am always contributing to that, one way or the other!</UTT>Yeah me too and did you know that Youtube first started out as a dating website? Of course that makes sense since its name youtube</UTT>It is also the second largest search engine.</UTT>I believe it!</UTT>It has been great chatting!  I have to get going.</UTT>Ok, it was great chatting with you too! Have a great night, take care!
t_28acf249-b81c-445d-88ba-2fac202c831b</CONV>Do you like watching Netflix?</UTT>Yes, I do, every night before bed. How about you? They have 150 movies with a 100 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.</UTT>Wow, I want a full list of those! I am always looking for something to watch late night. From 9pm-12 am they account for 33% of bandwidth in north america</UTT>Yeah, and most places you travel you can still access your account since it's available in countries except for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.</UTT>wow, I wonder why Crimea is on this list. Did you ever watch Lilyhammer?</UTT>I haven't watched that actually. I did hear that it was the first series debuted by Netflix.</UTT>It was a good show for sure. A little different, but I watched the first 2 seasons and it was enjoyable. I wonder what Netflix would have been like if blockbuster bought it</UTT>Yeah, I wonder. Blockbuster laughed them out of the office when Netflix proposed that Blockbuster use them as its online service.</UTT>now look who is laughing now. Netflix started because of a 40 dollar late charge</UTT>Yeah, I like how Netflix has all kinds of things to watch. You can even watch an hour long video of a fireplace, haha.</UTT>Right, nothing more soothing on christmas lol! Netflix has a lot of debt right now though</UTT>Oh, does it? I heard they spend a lot on programming. In some European markets, they monitor illegal downloads to determine what to buy.</UTT>I think it has 21 billion in debt right now and only worth 2 billion dollars</UTT>Oh, wow. Didn't know that. I wonder how many employees they have. You can get a job as a tagger, who are paid to watch Netflix and tag the content.</UTT>I would love that kind of job. I would gain so much weight though so maybe I shouldn't lol</UTT>WellI think I'm already gaining weight by just sitting here and watching Netflix, haha. What do you watch Netflix on? I watch on my laptop, TV and iphone.</UTT>lol me too. I watch on my game console mostly, but my iphone on the go. I love my iphone, do you like yours</UTT>Yeah, they are so easy to use and really reliable. I'm glad they come unlocked now. George Holtz was the first person to unlock a first generation iphone and sold it for a Nissan 350z and 3 locked iPhones. He was only 17.</UTT>Wow, that is crazy. Now they like come unlocked it seems. I don't like the stat that women are more likely to own iphones than men</UTT>Hmm, interesting. So to make an iPhone 8 Plus it costs $288.08. That is higher than I thought.</UTT>That is so much higher. I figured it was really cheap to make. It was so nice chatting with you, have a great weekend!
t_39c169e9-5fc7-4f5a-b02d-ec228756e59c</CONV>Have you heard about Elon Musk lately?</UTT>not really. Whats he into now.</UTT>He just recently lost his cool on a call.</UTT>Im sure as the ceo of Tesla. he probably is under a lot of stress.</UTT>He criticized journalists for just trying to get clicks.  Tesla doesnt do any advertising, and he pointed that out.</UTT>Well maybe he is just a jerk then.</UTT>He has been known to be one.  I read one of his biographies.</UTT>Did you know that the Tesla model s runs linux software.</UTT>I had heard that.  They could also test it on an indoor track because it doesnt produce emissions.</UTT>Maybe he is so stressed because he is giving his salary back to Tesla. He actually did that in 2014</UTT>That is quite the possibility.  He founded paypal, SpaceX and Tesla Motors.  He is really an innovator.</UTT>So he is probably not really hurting for money. Lol.</UTT>I would think money would be the last thing he needs.  I do think he spends a lot of it innovating the next things though.</UTT>True. Tesla actually helped develop the 2nd gen rav 4ev that toyota produces.</UTT>That is in part because Toyota owns 10% of Tesla</UTT>Seems like that relationship is backwards to me.</UTT>I would agree with that.  I would have thought it would be the other way around as well.</UTT>All I know is that he is one of the wealthiest men on earth. Speaking of, did you know that the earth will soon be helium free.</UTT>I heard that.  I am not sure what the ramifications of that are, but it doesnt sound good.</UTT>We will have to find something else to keep birthday balloons in the air.</UTT>Maybe if we stop using it now in the balloons, we might be able to conserve a bit more of it.  I dont know how it all works, but it is a thought</UTT>You should take that to your local congressman. Have a good one.
t_5a81607d-1f49-4bff-be1b-956003a1e7da</CONV>How's it going, did you know amazon was founded back in 1994?</UTT>Hi, I love Amazon and had no idea it dates back to 1994.</UTT>Yea, it is the 2nd largest online retailer in the world second only to Alibaba Group</UTT>Very cool. The first Amazon customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him.</UTT>That was nice of Bezos but I wonder why he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years</UTT>That's a very odd thing to build. Does it say why he built it?</UTT>Nope, I guess he built the clock because he's one of those eccentric billionaires lol</UTT>That's crazy. Did you know IMDB is owned by Amazon?</UTT>Yea, I guess Bezos is a movie buff since he bought IMDB in 1998</UTT>Very much so. Do you follow celebrity news?</UTT>I try not to but do anyway lol. I never knew Judge Judy makes 123,000 dollars an episode for her show</UTT>That's a lot of money for just one episode!</UTT>Yea, off her show Judge Judy is the 2nd highest paid celebrity after Lebron James</UTT>Very cool. Carol Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on Sesame Street.</UTT>Nice. Apparently doing animated voices wasn't a trend until Robin Williams did Aladdin</UTT>He was very good in Aladdin. Do you know much about the internet?</UTT>I know constant clicking can cause addiction in the brain lol</UTT>I have heard that as well. It doesn't surprise me.</UTT>It's pretty scary that clicking the hamburger button can lead to addiction</UTT>I agree. I had never even heard of the hamburger button before until today.</UTT>Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
t_7aa965d9-aec6-443e-88c9-4ed481e5ba30</CONV>do you like horror movies?</UTT>Yes somewhat. how about you?</UTT>I like it a lot. DO you know which movie King thinks is the scariest?</UTT>Yes that is Bambi, I do not see how though</UTT>Me either. You burn more calories though watching them</UTT>Yeah about 180 of them, good for a diet</UTT>Yes I know, DO you know how they make the creepy noises?</UTT>Yes they use an instrument called a waterphone</UTT>Yeah it is really creepy actually however it works</UTT>Yeah it is. Did you ever see the Shining?</UTT>I did and it was a scary movie. Do you like drama?</UTT>I love it. Did you ever watch House MD?</UTT>Yes I did. Did you know Laurie made $700 000 per episode there?</UTT>Wow tthat is amazing he was really good in nit though</UTT>He sure was. Do you like Jim Carrey?</UTT>Yes I do. Do you know why he does not do comedies anymore?</UTT>Yes because they do not project positivity</UTT>Yeah. Do you listen to radio dramas?</UTT>I listen to them sometimes , there is a free website for those</UTT>Yeah that is nice. Do you know why Michael Caine became an actor?</UTT>Yes he was chasing the pretty girls who were in drama class
t_e919f6c4-729e-44f4-861f-7d336ac304a9</CONV>Hello Friend, are you interested in the Internet?</UTT>hi how are you? yes i am interested in the internet.</UTT>The Internet is a network of networks that uses the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices world wide.</UTT>It has been around for decades. most people dont know that though. they think it is a recent invention.</UTT>I know a fun fact, did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button?</UTT>I have heard that name. it is a silly name. it is not a hamburger. the shape is something else. sandwich?</UTT>No, it looks like a hamburger to me. Did you know that only 7% of people read the full terms when buying a product or service on the Internet?</UTT>My hamburgers are wider in the middle. The burger must stick out of the buns! I am a purist about my buttons. The ToS are too long and dry for most people.</UTT>Yes, and the constant novelty from clicking links on the Internet can cause real addiction measurable in the brain.</UTT>i am already addicted, as far as i can tell. i figure that years of usage has rendered me helpless in the face of a computer.</UTT>Me too. The current library of Alexandria has a saved copy of the Internet in case the Internet burns down.</UTT>is this true? how could the internet burn down?</UTT>I know, right? The Internet consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks but they are all physical networks, so theoretically they could burn down.</UTT>The whole thing though? i figure each part has its own backups. How could the whole thing get backed up?</UTT>It's complicated. They are talking about the links. Speaking of burning, did you know that the Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System? It's a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field va a dynamo process.</UTT>The sun is a great force of attraction for so many planets in our vicinity. I am amazed at its force.</UTT>The Sun's diameter is 109 times that of the Earth and its mass is about 330,000 times that of the Earth. Wow, that's big.</UTT>Yes, it is gigantic. Cosmic. Stellar, even. I envy its size. So much energy, so much mass.</UTT>Yes, the Sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire planet for 500,000 years.</UTT>We need a place to store it all and I dont have any room at my house. That would be one big battery. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>I don't have any room at my house either, and yes nice chat.
t_d83f2e2e-a23d-4adc-b2e3-e85fe14a4bfc</CONV>Hello, do you watch basketball?</UTT>Hello, I love watching basketball, how about you?</UTT>Yes me too. DO you know who Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is?</UTT>Do I know who he is? Of course I do, he was the reason why the dunk was banned for a while in college! do you like him?</UTT>Yeah that is pretty amazing actually. Do you know who invented the sport?</UTT>I think some guy from kansas did, James Naismith. Did you know basketball coaches are the highest paid state employees in 39 of the 50 states?</UTT>Yeah that is mind blowing. Yeah it was him and he is the only losing coach in the history of U of Kansas too</UTT>That is crazy lol, you think he could have rigged it so he could have won.</UTT>Yeah I guess. Have you heard of the highest court in the land?</UTT>I have not heard of the highest court in the land, what is it?</UTT>Is is a basketball court in the US Supreme Court in the top floor of the vuilding</UTT>wow, that is awesome. I wouldn't mind playing ball there. Maybe they can ban the nicknames "tall black" in New Zealand.</UTT>yeah that sounds really strange to me too. On another topic do you enjoy reading?</UTT>I love reading, ever read starship troopers?</UTT>I have and I pleased to find out that it is in the reading list of military branches as well</UTT>The movie was awesome too, but so bad graphic wise, lol. CS Lewis is one of my favorite authors.</UTT>He is awesome. Apparently he and Tolkien had you laugh you lose competitions when they read bad poetry together</UTT>that is awesome! I want to know which poetry was read, lol!</UTT>Yeah me too, I wonder also who won more. How about Ender's Game, have you read it?</UTT>I loved Enders game! How about you?</UTT>Nice yeah me too that one seems to be n the recommended list for many military organizations too.</UTT>I bet! It was nice chatting with you!
t_b52b93e0-210d-4773-852d-575a44231b62</CONV>Hi, how are you? What kind of entertainment do you like?</UTT>Well I like playing a lot of video games and I like watching movies. What about you? I remember playing the NES back in the day, apparently it only has about 54 colors that it can display</UTT>It had only 54 colors, but fortunately the games were fun to play. It had a long lifespan, too. I guess there were fans out there for decades!</UTT>Yep it wasn't discontinued until 2003 in Japan. And mine still works and I play it today haha. What about you did you ever play it?</UTT>I didn't play it much. I had friends that played through Mario. They loved it! I would say that modern systems are more powerful, but the games are not necessarily more entertaining.</UTT>Yep I agree with you there. I'm just glad we live in modern times. We don't have to do what people did two thousand years ago and use chickens for our entertainment LOL</UTT>Chickens? What were the Brits thinking? They are for eating! Do you think Reagan looks presidential?</UTT>Well apparently he did not look that way at the time, or that's what someone said to him anyway, obviously we know how that turned out LOL do you like Bill Nye the Science Guy?</UTT>He got his break in entertainment by winning a Steve martin lookalike contest. I think he could be presidential. What about a Trump lookalike contest?</UTT>Haha that would be an interesting contest for sure. I know that I wouldn't be able to pull it off but maybe someone else could haha. Do you like comedy movies by the way?</UTT>I love comedies! I think it's a tough genre too. Very hard to be funny. Bill Murray thinks Kung Fu Hustle is "the supreme achievement of the modern age in terms of comedy". Can't agree with Bill on that one.</UTT>Haha I actually do like the movie but it's not a supreme achievement in my opinion, so you're right on that, do you like Jack Black at all?</UTT>Jack Black is very good at comedy. His whole presence is comedic. He has done a lot of great movies, too.</UTT>Yep I agree with you. I have a soft spot for him, and I guess he was going to originally be in that Green Lantern movie that starred Ryan Reynolds, you know the one that's horrible LOL</UTT>I haven't seen it. Ryan is funny, but I'm not big on superhero films. Usually not very good humor, and too much action. Not comedy.</UTT>Yep I prefer comedies to the superhero movies myself. What do you think about Monty Python?</UTT>Monty Python were innovators, very British. Love their movies, especially Grail. Hard for Americans to do that kind of humor.</UTT>Yep I love Monty Python. And I also am a programmer and even I didn't know that the programming language python was named after them that school</UTT>I would have thought of the snake, not the comedy troupe. Interesting!</UTT>Haha yep me too. Think about Comedy Central though? I think they are not very good, the only thing I watched on there is South Park, and they always cancel shows, so I believe that them canceling 100 shows since 1989 is pretty spot-on</UTT>It's a graveyard for shows. Put the python programming language on there and it would get cancelled, no doubt.</UTT>LOL I could see that. Did you ever watch the show 3rd Rock From the Sun? I liked Seinfeld a lot back in the day, and apparently Third Rock Beat It In The Comedy Awards for 1997
t_c0aa8ad8-6202-462d-8c51-1cb30356b054</CONV>Hi how are you?</UTT>I am well. Do you enjoy music?</UTT>I do like music and use spotify every day. Did you know they have 4 million songs that have not been played once?</UTT>That's a lot of waste! Do you think they will be able to turn the platform into video too?</UTT>That would be interesting. Those 4 million songs make up 20% of all of their songs.</UTT>They need to do something because apple music is catching up to them. They are only 3M subscribers behind.</UTT>That is a close race! Did you know youtube is the second largest search engine?</UTT>I did not. That makes sense though because they are owned by google, the number 1 search engine. I was surprised to learn the creator is from sweden. No idea.</UTT>I did not know that! Netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north America!</UTT>That's crazy! I was surprised to know an artist needs 130,745 plays a day to make minimum wage.</UTT>Thats a high standard. I love how a band earned $20000 on spotify for a silent album.</UTT>I love that album. Listen to it every night while I go to bed. I listen to it on youtube.</UTT>Same here! The Nintendo entertainment system only could display 54 colors.</UTT>Did you know police have blutube where there share video? I had no idea.</UTT>That is hilarious. It is also funny that Beibers "baby" video is the most disliked video on youtube.</UTT>That's the opposite of Psy's gangnam style. THat was so popular they had to upgrade to 64 bits.</UTT>That is hilarious. I never understood why it was so popular.</UTT>Me neither! I wonder what has been the biggest hit of 2018 and 2019, so far.</UTT>Good question. Did you know Bill Nye became famous because he won a steve martin look alike contest?</UTT>I can see it. At least he was never rejected for a science role that Regan was for a presidential role.</UTT>True that! It was nice chatting with you!</UTT>Ditto. Have a good night!
t_d61a3a63-395d-4c6b-824f-416792ce3c4f</CONV>It's truly remarkable how far the internet has come in the span of just over 20 years, wouldn't you say? I mean it's completely revolutionized everything from research and communications to commerce and gaming.</UTT>Absolutely. I vividly remember the buzz of AOL starting up. I think it's funny that we pu so much info online that people "egosurf", or look for info abou tthemselves.</UTT>Agreed. There's certainly something to be said about the addiction of clicking around the internet for useless things.</UTT>Yea, like neopets, which was the 4th most trafficked site on the web in 2001</UTT>I can't believe I'm about to ask...but neopets? Sounds familiar but don't recall..maybe I blocked it out! haha</UTT>It was like tamagotchie, basically raising a virtual pet. They even pooped. Any games you remember from the early internet?</UTT>Oh yes, now I remember. must have intentionally blocked it out along with tickle-me-elmo. Yes! I was a big gamer back then. Starcraft, Quake, a few others.</UTT>Repression can be good haha. I played Command and Conquest online, alog with starcraft. I also fee that everyone in finland has the right to the interet.</UTT>I used to love C&C. I think the last one I played was Generals zero hour...good times! I firmly believe that the internet is like the modern version of running water for our society. You can't deny people from having access to that knowledge. The net gain is far too massive for all of society.</UTT>I agree! Eeryone needs info</UTT>Are you a dog person or cat person? I used to have dogs when I was younger, but my life got too busy with a family and they got older and messier. Might reconsider in a few years getting another.</UTT>I have two cats, though raelly for my dogs I would love a dog and have a tall enough fence for a small dog. Dogs can learn more than a thousand words, wow!</UTT>It is incredible how much they can be trained, and how aware of their surroundings they are. I used to hear from family that the dogs would start barking happily when I was a block away from the house.Truly, man's best friend!</UTT>They can smell ya! And they are pretty smart.</UTT>Yes. I recall a questionable character walking around our home likely scoping out the place for later. One of my dogs (the passive, more well behaved one) went absolutely nuts when he saw that guy walking on the street...it's like he knew! (That man was later arrested for trying to break into a house)</UTT>We had a cocker spaniel who bit a home invader. Crazy considering hew as normally quite docile.</UTT>That's hilarious. Ours was a German shepherd, so I know they had it in them!</UTT>He was little too! it was so strange.</UTT>Funny. What's your take on the scientific community revoking Pluto as a planet?</UTT>Just call it a planet!</UTT>Agreed. Part of me wants to be open-minded and consider the change, but then again, this is a massive rock that rotates around the sun</UTT>Made of ice, too!</UTT>Exactly. The mention of Ceres shocked me though. I always thought that was just part of the millions of rocks comprising asteroid belt after mars and not actually a celestial body by name.</UTT>Have a good one!
t_2fd6ed79-7f55-40ec-967a-8181ab32209c</CONV>Are a fan of the NFL?</UTT>Hi, yes I like the NFL very much!! i love the Denver Broncos!! Ma favorite of the 32 teams!</UTT>How do you feel about the Patriots?</UTT>I like them too. Hope to watch them at the gillette stadium sometimes!!</UTT>They're definitely a better team than the Bills. The only thing they really have in common is the same number of Super Bowl losses</UTT>wow what a coincidence!Did you know there is a rocket scientist as a coach of the NFL!!</UTT>That's impressive. It would also be impressive to see a female player one day since there's no rule against it</UTT>They could if they meet the requirements!!</UTT>It's only eleven minutes of live gameplay, so it can't be that bad, right?</UTT>But the whole game is fun! Talking about the patriots they had the first German that turned us citizen in the NFL</UTT>Well, I don't know if you're familiar with Game of Thrones, but the author dubbed them the Lannisters of the NFL</UTT>I am a little bit familiar  with game of thrones, not too much... I do like how tracking chips are used to get info from players</UTT>It helps with keeping track of stats, that's for sure. I wonder if the engineers who thought of that get paid more than the players</UTT>For sure, but I guess they have to work many more years! Do you like to listen to the radio?</UTT>I don't, but it would be neat to find the website that has classic radio dramas you can listen to for free</UTT>I would love to.. be familiar with what people used to listen to before! did you know there is a station that broadcasts "sun"music?</UTT>Do you know if it's AM or FM? I know that sometimes AM can pick up radio storms from Jupiter</UTT>Sounds like this would be AM also! This station transforms solar activity into sound.. incredible</UTT>That would be about as easy to understand as the station in Finland that still broadcasts a new program in classical Latin</UTT>Wow, do people really listen to Latin today? Remember the hanson's?</UTT>Enough for a station to still broadcast it. I actually don't remember them</UTT>They had a song that became the most popular in an alternative station because they did not revealed the band's name!.. well good chat.... have a good one

I especially like the NBA, how about you?</UTT>I do as well. Unfortunately I'm a Knicks fan so I don't watch a lot of local games. I mostly watch the good teams play on TNT or ESPN.</UTT>You and me both! Maybe they'll get better soon haha. I bet Allen Iverson can't wait until he turns 55.</UTT>Why's that? I think he's still playing in China lol</UTT>He gets a lump sum of 32 million dollars for his life endorsement with Reebok! Big money!</UTT>Wow, that's great. Especially because more than of NBA players go broke 5 years after retirement.</UTT>I believe that! He would have played longer I'm sure if he did the granny style approach to shooting freethrows!</UTT>What do you think about this Space Jam 2 that Lebron James is thinking about making?</UTT>I think I would wait until it came out on netflix lol. You can never have a better movie than the original!</UTT>Haha true true. It was the highest grossing basketball move of all time. Although White Men Can't Jump was pretty damn good.</UTT>That was great as well! Speaking of Space Jam, did you know Air Jordan's were originally banned in the league?</UTT>Really? Even for Michael?</UTT>Well he still wore the shoes, but Nike payed the fines for him!</UTT>Spency Haywood couldn't have 10% stake in Nike about 30 years ago. He opted for $100,000 upfront instead. Ever hear of him?</UTT>I have never heard of him. I bet he keeps hitting himself over that every day lol.</UTT>Who do you think will win the NBA title this year? The Warriors?</UTT>I am hoping the Celtics actually. I'm not a fan but they are playing great ball. Who do you think?</UTT>It's hard to bet against the Warriors. I'd like to see the Bucks it though. Would be interesting with Kyrie if the Celtics make a big run.</UTT>Oh for sure! The bucks weren't even in the running at all. It will be interesting for sure. It was great chatting, have a great night!

What do you think?</UTT>ya I think so, each government has a type of constitution but ours probably has some issues that need changing like you said</UTT>The Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. I wish that our gov’t would do something like that.</UTT>ya that is a nice thing, weird that almost 90% of nevada is owned by the US gov.</UTT>A man in France impersonated a government official, and managed to sell the Eiffel Tower. Maybe he could help the gov’t sell some of the land in the Nevada.</UTT>lol good idea, and he sold it not once but 2 times, how wild!</UTT>I guess he was good at conning people. Did you hear that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? Seems ironic.</UTT>haha it does seem ironic, do you ever travel at all? could be done by foot, car, boat, or airplane, etc?</UTT>Travel is a great form of education. I don't know if I would go to Iceland though.</UTT>no and I wouldn't ride on teh dutch bus that goes 160mph haha</UTT>I bet the bus has a special lane or something. People hate commuting. Probably not much commuting on Mackinac Island in Michigan. It has banned motorized vehicles for over a hundred years. How do ambulances and fire engines get around?</UTT>I've been there, and they do have those things for emergencies, but its mostly horses and the whole island smells like horse dung lol</UTT>Horse dung? Charming. It must do wonders for the appetite. Have you been to Japan?</UTT>no but I hear all their highways are tolls, is that true?</UTT>Yes, and rather expensive ones at that. But the roads are fast because there is much less traffic, so you get what you pay for.</UTT>ya, it also costs like $300 do drive across the country, so that also sucks haah</UTT>Trains are a better way to travel around Japan. Unlike Iceland.</UTT>no you can't even use trains there, weird you have to take planes from city to city</UTT>I would go nuts from going through security all the time. Maybe drive a car? Intercity Uber?</UTT>ya or just get a pack of huskies and mush your way around lol
t_4463adb9-98ac-45fe-a268-3cc86fe59ac9</CONV>hi</UTT>Hi. Have you heard about Charles Krauthammer? He was a journalist, disabled but inspirational to many.</UTT>No, I never heard of him.  Just reading about him now.</UTT>He seems to have been paralyzed from the waist down. Not really an issue for journalists in a newsroom, but still, it shows you just how much people can do if they don't drown themselves in self-pity.</UTT>Oh, wait, I thought he was blind?  Is that another journalist?  Let me go back a read again.</UTT>He died of cancer at 68, paralyzed from a ^diving^ accident. At first, I thought it said "driving."</UTT>Yes, I just reread that.  I mixed up Hackman with Krauthammer.  Sorry.</UTT>That's cool. It's an amazing array of journalists out there with limitations. I wonder what relationship he had with Presidents of the US.</UTT>Well, it would seem at least one President he may not have had a great relationship with, according to article section 3.</UTT>It seems that Krauthammer took any criticism about his disability in stride.</UTT>I agree. He wouldn't let his disability stop him from accomplishing anything wanting to be respected for the man he was and the work he provided.  He did not want to be seen as a charity case.  I applaud him and many other in similar circumstances.</UTT>I imagined that Trump would have been one of the wealthiest presidents in US history, but JFK, Washington and Jefferson were.</UTT>Yes, I am actually shocked by that.  I thought Trump was a billionaire.</UTT>I think he's got a big enough ego to release some pop albums like the president of Indonesia. Trump has released every other kind of product, it seems.</UTT>Ha, I would not put it past him to try.  I also see why he loves Fox news as the network was created by republican media strategist.</UTT>Fox is an interesting phenomenon. It gets more attention than CNN and MSNBC together. I didn't realize it had such a following.</UTT>Yes, reading that really surprised me especially with CNN being around longer than the other networks.</UTT>Trump proposed another global network to compete with the "fake news" of CNN.</UTT>Nothing surprised me with that guy anymore, I don't even react when he says or does anything.  By the way, did you know Alladin's pants were modeled after MC Hammer?</UTT>And here I thought that MC Hammer chose his pants to look like Aladdin's!  And Aladdin didn't even need to ride a horse!</UTT>Ha, nice.
t_dd9e1e21-4b69-49f0-8fa6-79f073174dc2</CONV>Do you watch a lot of dramas?</UTT>Sometimes I do.  I used to watch the show House.  It was good. I learned recently that Hugh Laurie made the most money ever for a tv drama actor. He got $700,000 per episode.</UTT>I used to watch that show as well, that's a lot of money per episode.</UTT>It definitely is.  What do you think of mimes?</UTT>I've never watched a mime do a full performance so I don't know what to think of them.</UTT>I've seen them on tv.  They say that mime is a form of drama. I actually never thought about it like that until recently.</UTT>I know there have been a few famous mimes so there has to be something to that art form.</UTT>True.  Do you like opera?  It's another form of drama.</UTT>I have never seen an opera, how about you?</UTT>No I haven't.  I haven't seen a ballet either and supposedly it's a form of drama too.  I guess my exposure to drama is limited to tv and movies.</UTT>I have been to the ballet, it's amazing that you can see the storytelling in the dance itseld.</UTT>Yeah?  Is it like a play of sorts?</UTT>Yes if you replace the dialogue with dancing it kind of works that way.</UTT>Sounds nice!  Have you ever listened to any radio dramas?</UTT>I have not but I have listened to a podcast that was made to resemble one of those.</UTT>Some of them are pretty good.  Hey, have you heard of Michael Caine?</UTT>Yes, he's a great actor. He was awesome in the new Batman movies as Alfred.</UTT>I agree!  Did you know that the whole reason he became an actor was because all of the pretty girls were in drama class at his school?</UTT>I would imagine that's the reason a lot of actors got their start!</UTT>You're probably right!  Do you like Jim Carrey?</UTT>I do, I liked his earlier stuff. He's gotten a little strange now.</UTT>He's not doing dramas any more because his belief system prevents him from doing them.
t_6043b764-fdd9-4ece-96b1-ed2c43b84600</CONV>hey there what are your thoughts on the us senate?</UTT>I think it is a fascinating part of the us government</UTT>ya I agree, did you hear that richard nixon actually cracked a gavel that was almost 200 yeras old</UTT>No! I also did not know that the only us president to have a phd was Woodrow Wilson.</UTT>that is kind of scary, did you know the guest house is actually bigger than the white house itself</UTT>That is amazing. I would love to be that guest.</UTT>ya, I know that Trump has Kanye over, maybe he could stay in the guest house and they could make a pop album? Like the pres. of indonesia did</UTT>Agreed. I think Kanye should definitely run for president next election.</UTT>ya I wonder what would happen, did you know the runner up used to become the VP, maybe it will be president Kanye and VP Trump!</UTT>Did you know the last president to speak a foreign language was FDR?</UTT>no that is crazy, also crazy is how ancient athens would decide their leaders: using the lottery ahha</UTT>A cat named hank placed third in the virginia senate election. Hank should have won.</UTT>haha I would have voted for him, sad that american voter participation has topped out at 63% though</UTT>And 5 presidents were elected while still losing the popular vote.</UTT>yup screwy, do you think the dems should run a basketball player in 2020? I guess the taller candidate would win 75% of the time</UTT>Yes I most certainly do.</UTT>I'm curious why international election oberservers were blocked from polling places in 2012, they werent allowed in 9 states, that is scary to me</UTT>Agreed. And all elections in Oregon are by mail. That is interesting.</UTT>ya that would help raise voter turnout, I also like how nevada has a none of the above option when voting</UTT>What is the point! I would probably pick that just to say I voted.</UTT>haha yup exactly, I like how long elections have been held, I guess that is the way most countries have been run since the 17th century, its a great time we live in
t_172fd7a0-7d93-4385-a8c6-656e57c4080e</CONV>I am not a fan of Mitch McConnell.  The senate majority leader has gone somewhat nuts.</UTT>Good afternoon, I try to avoid the political shenanigans.  It's just one shyster trying to get something over on the other guy, all the time.</UTT>Yes but even in 2016 the CIA was meeting with senior congressional leaders over the fact that Putin had authorized an operation to destabilize our election</UTT>That's Putin for you, he's going to do that, hard to believe it took the CIA needing to tell them he was doing it.  I'm sure all of our "frenemies"  do the same thing and we do it to them, too.</UTT>Yes but it is scary that McConnell is denying the evidence and claiming that it is just a scheme by the CIA to discredit Trump.  He does not believe all of our national security agencies.</UTT>On a different and much happier note than all that crazy political mess, do you realize the consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000?  That's probably about the time it started to get real ugly in politics.</UTT>Yes that is crazy but it has been ugly for a while - Harry Truman visited disneyland and refused to be photographed on the dumbo ride because it might associate him with republicans!</UTT>You know the voter turnout for a US presidential election hasn't breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.  I'm going to be watching 2020, I think Trump can break that!</UTT>Certainly he has 60 percent of the country who think he is doing a horrible job so it might increase the turnout!  Too bad we can't have third parties - there has not been one elected since 1853</UTT>Actually, I think there are that many that WANT to vote for him and are going to turn out to vote against whatever candidate the Dems throw up there.  That third party thing has never seemed to work out too well, a shame.</UTT>Well if he grew a beard it might help his chances - every president with a beard ever has been a republican</UTT>Well, that's a Southern/ Texas thing, a beard and that is the base for the Republicans, so that makes perfect sense to me. But, I usually look at the taller candidate, they seem to win 75% of the time, so maybe the Dems should be looking for them a giant?</UTT>That is a good point.  Beto O'Rourke is crazy tall - maybe he will win.   I think Nevada has the right plan - they have a none of these candidates option on their ballot</UTT>Or do what the officials in Ancient Athens did and appoint by lottery.  It you get picked, you get picked, do the job, and then move on and let the next one be picked to serve.  Probably more fair of a way than all the BIG money being pumped by both sides.</UTT>I agree.  Though I might go for term limits other a true lottery - I can think of a lot of my friends who I would not want making decisions in the government!</UTT>Oh, I got a few of them kind as well, friend.  I didn't realize that in the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in nine states.  I wonder if the CIA knew about that?  Maybe they were trying to pull something to affect our elections?</UTT>Yes there has been some craziness over the years.  I mean one year the ballot counting in Florida was stopped by the brother of the guy running for President - how would that have looked if it had happened in Africa or somewhere?  Fishy?</UTT>You know I'm from Florida and I love the Bush family.  They are good people and I remember them elections well, all we heard on mainstream media was this county here is majority Democrats, but how is it that 90% voted for the Republican candidate.  We're all registered Democrats, but vote Republican.</UTT>Why register Democrat then?    By 2000, the Republican party has firmly aligned with Christian conservatism, and has its chief support from the south, the great plains and the mountain states.</UTT>Once a great while ago, the Democrats did represent us, though it no longer does now. Me for example if I want to have more" opportunities" to vote in Local elections, I have to be registered how the majority of the candidates are registered as.  So, if only Democrat candidates are running, well I better be a Democrat for awhile on paper and switch back after the election.  Designation means NOTHING.  Leftists need to learn that lesson.  Everybody knows the coast and big cities are Democrats and rural south and heartland states are Republicans.</UTT>Absolutely.  I have voted in Republican primaries in Texas for the most moderate candidate before.
t_c8a4d93f-bfba-4e95-a342-ac392d36d3ed</CONV>Good Afternoon!</UTT>Hi there.  I just learned that a wealthy board member of the University of Virginia wanted to sponsor a shoe shopping day for female staff and some women were offended.  Virginia just cannot get a break.</UTT>Isn't that the truth!  What was the reason behind a female only shopping spree?  I hope it wasn't nefarious</UTT>It was to celebrate his Mom's 102 birthday.  The women objected because they want to choose the groups they associate with and this trip would jam them together arbitrarily.</UTT>Interesting!</UTT>The guy had to resign from the board.  He just wanted to express generosity and have some people have some fun.  It was a strange turn of events.</UTT>Like you said - nothing these days about the Commonwealth of Virginia surprises me any more!  That's amazing</UTT>Speaking of shopping for shoes, Stephon Marbury promoted a line of shoes that cost $15 and took no money for the endorsement.</UTT>Starbury is a good dude, he played here in Phoenix and did a lot of good stuff in the community and was pretty selfless.  This does not surprise me, and I think I heard about it a while back.  Thought he was still playing in China?</UTT>I am in Ahwatukee myself.  Some shoes are safety equipment.  I have known men who wore steel toed shoes to protect against heavy items being dropped.</UTT>For sure, very valuable in the construction industry!  I bet some of those shoes start to smell pretty bad after a few years of work!</UTT>Undoubtedly.  They say that dry tea bags will absorb the odor.  I wonder how long it takes.</UTT>I guess there's always a double use for everything every made in the world.  I wonder how these things are discovered?!?!</UTT>Good point!  Did someone drop a tea bag and then did not notice it and one shoe smelled better compared to the other one?</UTT>Right!  I guess we'll never know if it was science or accidents - shoes are pretty weird when you think about how diverse they are and pretty much everyone has several pairs and types</UTT>NFL wide receiver Steve Smith would leave his pair of cleats on the field after each game to remind people of the homeless who don't have shoes.</UTT>Another good dude athlete!  I remember this gesture and how he didn't make a big deal about it until the media caught on.</UTT>I just heard about it recently.  I did see him do some interviews and he came across as a good guy.  I also read that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  Another one of those, "How do the measure that?"</UTT>Did someone walk a mile in someone's 5,000 year old shoes?  Great point, and they couldn't have been comfortable!</UTT>Yes, that's right.  Years ago, shoes were more for function and there is some of that now like the steel toed ones.  However, they are much more for fashion now than they used to be.</UTT>Fashion for sure and the prices for some are crazy - I've seen "designer" sneakers for $500 - that's ridiculous!</UTT>It sure is.  When our kids moved out, I put in shoe racks and we now have a "shoe room" for my wife in what used to be a bedroom.  Nice conversation.  Thanks.
t_737f7b65-52db-42f2-8237-cd0a32de61de</CONV>Hi How are you this evening?</UTT>Hello,  I am doing great!  How are you?</UTT>I am good thanks. Are you interested in outer space?</UTT>Definitely.  More than kid rock anyway.</UTT>Cool Did you know that The planet uranus actually rotates sideways and "rolls" around the sun rather than "spinning" like the other planets.</UTT>Not until today!  I'm learning so much from these chats.  That's interesting.  I wonder if it only experiences seasons on the part that the sun shines on.</UTT>IDK I know its so complex Its crazy</UTT>So interesting.  Around one in five sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.  I wonder what grows on these stars?  Maybe this is where Actor and Actresses come from lol (Stars)</UTT>LOL Linkin park's "hybrid theory" is the best-selling album of the 21st century.</UTT>Thats amazing,  I love that band.  Really sad about Chester Bennington though.</UTT>yes absolutely. I was more upset over Chris Cornell. So sad.</UTT>I dont really know his work,  except he was on soundgarden.  Seeems like a lot of musicians suffer from some sort of ailment.</UTT>Lots of them "stars" do too. Its so outta control the world seems at times.</UTT>I know right!  Thats really sad.  What type of music do you listen to?</UTT>I love rock and rap no country really  I know I am strange. How bout you?</UTT>I like all kinds,  even country sometimes.  I listen to mostly r&b and rap,  and a lot of disney songs lol</UTT>Thats cool. I listen to a lot of radio. Do you?</UTT>Yes,  or pandora.  Im not picky,  anything that sounds good,  or that I can sing a long to.</UTT>Yes me too. Its has been good chatting with you.</UTT>You too have a great day</UTT>Thanks You too.
t_97efe210-9ff2-47d4-89f2-3d4df1e629d9</CONV>Are you comfortable talking about the election and voting?</UTT>ya we can do that, did you hear that a chimp literally got like 400k votes back in 1988 for mayor?</UTT>Really? For mayor of which state?</UTT>well it was for Rio De Janeiro, but unfortuantely or fortunately he came in 3rd place haha</UTT>I guess that was their alternative to having a none of these candidates voting option</UTT>haha good point, did you know that canada would only ahve 50 electoral votes if we took it over and made it a state?</UTT>I did not. I wonder if it would be for better or worse if everyone had to vote like in the UK since 1918</UTT>ya that is a good question, did you like JFK? I guess in 1957 he voted against the civil rights act</UTT>That is a shame. I can't say I know enough to say I liked JFK, but I did think that he was vaguely among the more qualified people in the position of president so far. I wonder if there ever will be a 3rd party president</UTT>that is a good quesiton, did you know that Hillary was a Republican back when she was in college?</UTT>I wonder what made her change her affiliation?</UTT>thats a good question, did you know that Republicans and Dems do an annual baseball game? And republicans are up by 3 wins overall?</UTT>I didn't. I did recently found out that every us president with a beard is a republican? Who knows maybe it is the invasion of the beard aliens</UTT>haha that is wild! imagine hillary with a beard</UTT>She must have fended off the beard aliens and joined the other side after. By the way did you know that the red and blue colors for republicans and democrats are relatively recently, only starting in 2000</UTT>no that is wild, also wild is that a us senator was arrested for civil disobedience, he was a repub. who was protesting apartheid</UTT>That is a shame. He had a good head on his shoulder, but too bad he was too progressive for his time</UTT>yup I agree, also progressive was apparently Richard NIxon, he wanted to pass a guaranteed minium income bill</UTT>I personally find nixon to be mixed. There are some controversy that his war on drugs may have been a war on race. Even today for instance, 34% of the black male population in alabama permanently can't vote and the prisons are very heavily populated with minority populations</UTT>ya I could see that, thats a valid argument, kind of crazy too that Ayn Rand who is a symbol for the tea party, was on social security and also medicare</UTT>Many historic figures are on the right side of some issues and the wrong side of others since what people perceive to be right and wrong is subjective and reflective of a diverse amalgamation of bias. In any case, this chat with you was enjoyable. I hope you have a wonderful day.
t_459f6b54-d219-47bd-a366-8f6fbc82d8c9</CONV>Do you know who Steve Bannon is?</UTT>I think so. He worked for the Trump campaign didn't he? What do you know about him?</UTT>Not much really he was Trumps chief strategist so he must be pretty good at his job, if he could make someone like Trump win then he does miracles lol</UTT>Yeah I would say so! I guess he also ran the website Breitbart, which is a very conservative website. And Trump tried to downplay his contributions I guess.</UTT>Well Trump is full with suprises, did you know his not on the list of top 3 wealthiest presidents?</UTT>Wow that is surprising! I think the other three are JFK, Jefferson, and Washington right? They must have taken inflation into account</UTT>That makes sense, Trump is really rich but theres also a lot of secrecy with his finances so its hard to tell</UTT>Yep that's true. Have you ever visited the white house before? Do you know what the Guesthouse is? Apparently it's bigger than the White House itself</UTT>Bigger than the white house? wow! I heard the White House has solar panels in the roof, George W Bush had them placed back on the White House</UTT>Oh wow that's interesting! I think that Jimmy Carter put them on initially, then Megan took them off, then I think George W put them back on actually, I'm just shocked that the White House still uses floppy disks, now those are outdated technology!</UTT>It sounds outdated and it is but I guess its hard to hack, maybe they use them for security reasons, Teddy Roosevelt banned christmas trees from the White House, sounds like someone wanted to be like the grinch</UTT>Haha I can see that, I actually do like Teddy Roosevelt I'm shocked that he did that, but he was a conservationist so it makes sense, would you ever visit the White House twin buildings? One is in Ireland and one is in France</UTT>That would be interesting I knew about the one in France but didnt know Ireland had one as well, I guess I would like to go to France first,</UTT>If I were in France I would probably check it out. It's probably not as busy as the real White House. Do you remember when it took the Secret Service realized that the White House had been shot at. They finally found thebullet holes 4 days later</UTT>And I bet someone got fired that day lol how can they miss that, I bet the president wasnt happy about that,</UTT>Haha no I don't think so. Do you ever watch television by the way? Have you seen the way that Southpark skewers current events, that's one of my favorite shows</UTT>Ilike Southpark so funny! they seem to have a good relationship with the Simpsons crew</UTT>I agree with you! Did you ever see the episode where South Park was making fun of Family Guy? That one is so awesome, and then afterwards the Simpsons creators sent South Park Flowers</UTT>I did catch that one but I bet it was awesome, I might look it over, did you ever watch Pokemon?</UTT>I watched it as a kid! I always loved that show but it was on so early I never got to watch it too much, but now I know there are about 800 episodes, I'll never be able to catch up LOL</UTT>I agree, too many Pokemons by now, Pikachu used to be my favorite and now there are so many, its been 16 years since the creation of the show.</UTT>I agree with you! And I don't like any of the new Pokemon myself, I only like the original 151, do you ever watch The Simpsons? Have you seen the episode without Bart?

I heard that they have more computing power than the entire us nuclear icbm deterrent.</UTT>I read that too. New York's area code is 212 because they are lazy....</UTT>Lol! What do you mean by that?</UTT>It is the fastest number to dial! Plus I love making fun of New Yorkers!</UTT>So the powers that be gave them the fastest number to dial?  Seems kind of rude to everyone else.</UTT>I know! Although I am from chicago and we have 312. We're not that much more motivated to dial. Did you ever use a rotary phone?</UTT>No I haven't.  Have you used one?</UTT>My parents used to have one. I will admit that if your finger slipped, you had to hang up and start over.</UTT>Have you ever seen a large phone book?  They say that if you overlap the pages of two of them together they are impossible to separate.</UTT>I have seen those. They are really outdated and I just got one.</UTT>Have you ever tried overlapping their pages?</UTT>I have not. Have you? I would think I could do it but that may be my hubris talking.</UTT>It does seem like it would be possible when you think about it.  I haven't tried it though.</UTT>Did you know the cables in the ocean carrying the internet is only 2.7 . inches?</UTT>No I didn't. That seems pretty small considering all of the information that is carried in them.</UTT>I know. Wouldn't a fish or shark be able to chew through that?</UTT>You would think so.  Plus it would seem easy to move around in the water.</UTT>Nice chatting with you!

THere are twin buildings of it in Ireland and France</UTT>Nice. Do you know their first phone number?</UTT>I have no idea for I know that Roosevelt did not allow christmas trees in there</UTT>WOw that is too much. The number was 1</UTT>WOw that is really fitting. Did you know they still use floppy discs</UTT>Wow cool. There is replica of it in Alabama too and it is a private home</UTT>WOw. The white house was hit in 2011 and no one noticed for  4 days</UTT>WOw that is scary. Do you like dogs?</UTT>I love dogs. Did you know they have 12 blood types?</UTT>WOw that is nest. They can learn up to 1000 words</UTT>Yes and they understand poininting, just like elephants</UTT>Yeah and they can reason better than chimps</UTT>Nice. Did you know Google declare themselves to be a dog company?</UTT>WOw that is cool. Dogs can have eureka moments and they love getting rewards for slving problems</UTT>Nice. Did you know that they are not colorblind?</UTT>I thought they were. DO you know how the drink water?</UTT>No they just see less colors than we do. How do they drink?</UTT>They actually drink with the underside of their tongue</UTT>Wow awesome. Nice chatting with you
t_9150eb04-eae4-4b91-8553-a7adccbfcbba</CONV>Hello!</UTT>Hello there, how are you doing? Do you watch the World Cup finals every 4 years?</UTT>I am great! I don't usually follow the world cup, but I have heard the American team has never placed below 3rd since 1991</UTT>I usually do, I get pretty excited for it.  And that is interesting, I think they are talking about the Women's team, they dominate.</UTT>Women's team dominate? That's awesome!  So who is the current World cup champion?</UTT>Yeah the US women's team has been the best since the sport started basically.  And France won it this year for the men's.</UTT>Very cool. Maybe I should get into it more. So I heard that the 2022 Qatar FIFA world cup final ....the city doesn't yet exist?</UTT>You are right, I don't know why they voted to do it there.  It will have to be played in December rather than the usual June/July due to the hot weather.</UTT>Wow, that is very interesting. So I understand that for the past World cup, the most tickets sold to fans in the USA more than any other nation?</UTT>I didn't know that but that is very interesting.  I am a bit surprised by that to be honest.</UTT>That was was the same case but for Brazil 4 years ago because the US national team failed to qualify.</UTT>Yeah that was really sad, I do know there are no economic gains for the country that hosts.</UTT>I have heard that. I would think with so many people attending that that would be huge for the country. People would need to eat and sleep so that seems odd.</UTT>I agree, that is very surprising to me, but I guess it costs a lot to build a lot of what they need.</UTT>Oh true, I didn't think of that aspect. So the money the country makes probably covers the cost of being the host.</UTT>Yeah I guess it must not, still boggles my mind though that it would be true.</UTT>Same here. It is amazing this has been going on since 1930</UTT>Yeah it sure has, I love how it can bring different countries together to celebrate.</UTT>Yes! I was reading an article about it. Sounds amazing to be able to join in on such an amazing gathering of people.</UTT>Yeah I hope to go one day, I think it will come back to the states soon enough though.</UTT>So I guess I don't understand how it all works but I think if it did come here to the US I would definitely consider going. Imagine how many countries and different people you could be in celebration with? Sounds awesome.</UTT>Yeah it sure does, I think it works well here.  Anyways, it's been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good night!

Aaron Posner, a playwright, is researching things to do there.</UTT>I do its one of my favorite places, so many things to do over there</UTT>Yes, the Mall is my favorite.  It is surrounded by so many interesting things.  Aaron likes the National Building Museum.</UTT>I like that building as well, its kind of awesome and has many cool attractions inside,</UTT>This Aaron guy is really looking for things to do with his 6-something daughter.  They were going to a play together at the Kennedy Center.</UTT>He should go to that Asian place, its called Kin Da, its in Takoma Park, the food there is delicious.</UTT>He may like that.  His daughter does have a sensitivity to gluten so I think that may work.</UTT>Yeah she should try the tofu, its one of the best dishes at the place</UTT>Maybe they went there after seeing The Incredibles 2?  I guess Presidents Day in that movie was set in the 1960s.</UTT>That is a long time ago, so the second part is set in the 60s? that must be like a prequel then</UTT>Dunno.  Speaking of a long time ago, the original NES could only display 54 colors.  Did you play it?</UTT>I cant say I did, I used to have a Nintendo 64 and that was a great system, did you play with it?</UTT>No, my kids did.  They didn't discontinue that system in Japan until 2003.</UTT>Thats too bad I bet many fans felt sad about the news, its amazing how entertainment has changed over the years.</UTT>Yeah, when I first sow "Pong" I had no idea what that meant.</UTT>Now we have a lot of pre recorded products, we have many video games consoles, 3d movie theaters, technology is just amazing</UTT>It's crazy.  Crazy like Ronald Reagan getting turned down for a part playing a president.  He didn't have that "presidential look".  Funny...</UTT>That is really ironic lol, he showed them, I bet he became president just to prove them wrong lol</UTT>Could be... Rejection is a part of life.  Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since it began in 1989.</UTT>That sucks, I bet many were disappointed because of the cancelling of the shows, do you like the channel?</UTT>It's so-so.  Seems like it was better when it came out.  Thanks for the chat!</UTT>I think it has lost a lot of quality I agree with you there.
t_5a20ce41-125c-42ed-9fb3-a6ed2cd6e26d</CONV>Do you know much about Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball?</UTT>I know they play for the Lakers. Thats about it.</UTT>Not really my thing, I hear they like to give each other a hard time.</UTT>I think thats just young guys being young guys. I have certainly done some of that in my day.</UTT>I like the fact that Ball recorded a track to go after his friend.  That's showing commitment to the cause.</UTT>Yeah it is. I know they are just joking with each other but with it in the publicity like that. Its bound to draw negative attention. Especially if you mention a sensitive subject like someone not having their father around.</UTT>It's like you said, boys being boys.  It's just that in this day and age everyone can witness what you're doing online.  To get an artist like Drake involved is taking it about as far as it can go.</UTT>Yeah I'm not really sure who Drake is. I guess he is a rapper. Don't know what he sings though. Or raps, I should say.</UTT>I know the name and I know he's famous, but I could not tell you a single Drake song.</UTT>So are you an NBA fan. I used to watch it a lot more when I was a kid, but I still like to see the highlights from time to time. My favorite player was always Allen Iverson.</UTT>I know basketball about as well as Drake.  I know the main detail, teams and famous players, but I can't go beyond that.  I live near Cleveland, so I've very aware of LeBron, and that the Cavaliers suck now.</UTT>Yeah i thought it was pretty crappy of Lebron to do what he did to Cleveland. I mean he would have been one of the best ever no matter where he played. He could have done it for his home town team and been an even bigger legend in my opinion.</UTT>I remember the first time he left when people were burning his jerseys.  They forgave him when he returned and delivered a championship.  I Guess he feel he did his job.  Now he has to deal with Ball and Kuzma.</UTT>Yeah I just dont understand it. I dont even think they will win one in LA.</UTT>Probably just wants to be in California.  I can't blame him, I hate Ohio winters.</UTT>Yeah I am right across the state line from Oh. I live in WV. Winters do get pretty bad from time to time.</UTT>So what's your favorite NBA team?</UTT>I dont really have one. I just like the game. I think NBA players are the best athletes in the world and they do some amazing things athletically.</UTT>I once did an event with a couple of Washington Wizards, they weren't that famous.  Those guys are massive, I'm six four but I had to look up to them and then they are twice as wide as me.</UTT>That sounds cool. Were they nice guys though.</UTT>Yeah, it was charity event.  they looked lie giants compared to the average person.</UTT>That's awesome. Well its been nice chatting with you this morning. I gotta be getting to work soon. Maybe ill talk to ya again sometime.</UTT>Have a good day.

Do you have a pet?</UTT>I do not but OI hear they develop white patches when domesticated</UTT>I have two dogs but have not noticed that</UTT>Oh I see. Do you know in Germany animal rights are protected by the constitution</UTT>I think we should have something like that here too</UTT>I agree. Do you know why we have hiccups?</UTT>Yes a holdover from when ancestors had gills and lungs at the same time</UTT>Yeah. Did you know the Loch Ness monster is a protected species?</UTT>Yes under the animal rights act in Scotland</UTT>Yeah pretty cool. Did you know we lost our hair less that a quarter million years ago?</UTT>Yeah pretty recent . Do you know why we are good persistent runners?</UTT>Yes because we used to be hunters and that came in handy</UTT>Yeah. Did you know we are the only ones that cannot synthesize vitamin c?</UTT>Yes other animals have the enzyme that does that and we do not</UTT>Yeah. There is a frequency of sound that scares us</UTT>I wonder what that sounds like, out of curiosity</UTT>Yeah. Nice chat today</UTT>Same here
t_85730cea-a48c-4feb-8b59-30b0ddf8af3a</CONV>Hello there, I hope you are doing well.  Are you a fan of country music?</UTT>I don't know too much about it, but I was just reading about the sad story of Carrie Underwood, with all those miscarriages.</UTT>Yeah that was quite sad to read, I feel for people who are in that situation, and especially those like her that go through it more than once.</UTT>Yes, have never heard about somebody with that missfortune. But I am reading that she was mad at God and she told Him, and it seems that He listened at her. Perhaps we are always afraid to make Him mad and not tell Him what is going on with us?</UTT>Yeah I think you are right, or it seems to me that a lot of us, myself included only reach out when we are at our lowest points, or are experiencing extreme pain.</UTT>Well, I contact Him daily, but I think I am pretty boring. I am not like the preachers that can say a lot of nice things, lol. I didn't know this, that we can fit all the planets in between earth and the moon and still have room left over to spare. I though, that it was closer.</UTT>Wow, that is very interesting, I didn't know that.  Did you know that more than 80% of the Earth's natural forests have been wiped out?  That is a sad but true fact.</UTT>I was just thinking that I hope we can reforest it again, all the 80%. And it says that the Hudson bay  has been found to have less gravity than the rest of the Earth, i am sure I can be 3 pounds skinnier, there!</UTT>Yeah I think if we could get even 20-30% back that would be a huge help for healthy oxygen levels coming back.  And wow, I didn't know that, I wonder why that is.</UTT>I think it could be because of the minerals, some minerals have more magnetism than others, I don't know, I studied Chemistry a long time ago. It could be that. Perhaps in that part of the Earth, since the mantle, it has less magnetic particles. Well, I don't think you are old enough in order to know about the 45 and 78 rpm records.</UTT>Yeah that is an interesting theory, you may be correct.  And unfortunately I am too young to have lived through the 50's and 60's but I do know a bit about records.  I love music from those era's.</UTT>hahaha, is because we had the best music, lol, no, I like more like the 70's and 80's, I am old but not that old, lol. I remember those records, if they stay long enough under the Sun, you were going to be mad.</UTT>I would have loved to have had that problem growing up. Do you know what the best selling album of the 21st century is?</UTT>No, please, tell me, love to know more</UTT>I guess it is Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory', which is a complete surprise to me.  I am not a fan but know who they are.</UTT>Oh, wonderful, thank you for telling me. I was reading that the country music was called Hillbilly, that is so funny, the only country singer I like is John Denver, RIP.</UTT>Yeah John Denver was great, I could listen to him.  I'm more of a classic country type if I do listen to that genre.</UTT>Which one is the classic country type? I like classical music, like Rachmaninov, but I like classic rock too.</UTT>Well like Hank Williams Sr. and stuff like that.  I love classic rock as well.</UTT>I didn't know that country music originated in the celtic music. Love these Irish.</UTT>Wow, that is another very interesting fact.  Well it was nice talking with you, I hope you enjoy the rest of the day.
t_7fe4b8b4-5d06-4b29-b854-964d18868a12</CONV>Hi there! Are you familiar with You Tube?</UTT>Yes, I am listening to some music from it while not watching the videos. I think that the sound quality is much better than other places.</UTT>Yes, I agree. You Tube is actually the second largest search engine on the net.</UTT>Yeah, it is used by a lot of people. Gangnam Style got so many views that they had to upgrade the view count integer to 64 bits.</UTT>Oh, that video was the worst!! I've heard Justin Bieber's "baby" is the most disliked video on You Tube.</UTT>It is pretty annoying. Netflix and YouTube together make up half of peak internet traffic in North America. Wonder how many people are secretly watching and listening to "Baby"</UTT>Haha-good one! Did you know that the police actually have their own You Tube called Blue Tube?</UTT>I did not know that! What is on there?</UTT>They use Blue Tube to share law enforcement videos.</UTT>Huh, interesting.Do you like to watch TV?</UTT>I do like to watch TV.</UTT>I like the Simpsons a lot. There is only one episode where Bart doesn't appear and is not mentioned.</UTT>That is so weird! Did you know the Simpson's crew sent flowers to South Par's Family Guy when they aired the final episode?</UTT>I didn't know that. I wonder what that is about. When I was little my parents and I all enjoyed the Simpsons together. I also liked Pokemon. They didn't like that that much.</UTT>My kids like Pokemon. There are over 750 episodes. I wonder how many I've seen?</UTT>Yeah that's 50 a year for 16 years straight. Now my kids watch it as well.</UTT>Oh, no way I'd be able to sit through that many episodes. Of course, with You Tube I'm sure all the episodes are out there.</UTT>Haha, but you gotta catch all the episodes as well right? Just kidding, I would not want to watch all the episodes. Sounds like something out of a horror movie.</UTT>Well, on the bright side watching a horror movie burns 180 calories!</UTT>Not with all the popcorn I eat. Haha. I like the creepy metallic noises in horror movies, the ones made by a waterphone. I'd love to hide in the dark and follow people around with one.</UTT>Not me, I'm way too chicken! Good chatting with you today.
t_843d5c4c-4500-4111-b8cd-b4e7e7135276</CONV>Hi, do you want to chat about Mars? Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman God of War and is often referred to as the Red Planet.</UTT>I would say that Mars is a fierce looking neighbor, but probably the friendliest planet at least for humans. Second to earth, that is.</UTT>Yes, I agree, it's reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.</UTT>I think the red is clear from a distance, but up close, it's not quite so red. Plus I bet the atmosphere changes the appearance of a lot of things. And sound, too.</UTT>Well, Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere having surfaces like the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.</UTT>Mars has an atmosphere, but it makes the sunsets blue, I believe. Not really breathable.</UTT>Yes, due to the differences in atmosphere, sounds on Mars have a higher pitch than they do on Earth.</UTT>That would make us sound funny! Like helium balloons do. Still, I would rather live my life on Earth. I know that with fast travel, we could get to Mars fast. But what would you do there?</UTT>If you change your mind, a Mars colonization project is planned for 2023 and will be funded by creating a reality TV show.</UTT>I would not want to be the first there. Couldn't pay me enough.</UTT>If you would fly to Mars under constant 1g acceleration, it will only take 2 or 3 days to get there.</UTT>That is still quite a while for regular business trips. And in economy class? Forget about it.</UTT>I agree. Only the lichens and cyanobateria would be able to thrive on Mars anyway.</UTT>I guess we could put atmosphere converters there and give it a few decades to shift to oxygen. Maybe it would be habitable.</UTT>Depends on a lot of factors.  Did you know that a satellite was lost on Mars because Locheed Martin used the imperial system while NASA used the metric system.</UTT>That was a serious oversight. How can scientists and engineers ever use that outdated system? I'm surprised.</UTT>Talk about crazy, did you know that more than 80% of the earth's natural forests have already been destroyed?</UTT>We are destroying our home so fast. Can we put forests on Mars? Doubtful. We can't even do it here.</UTT>Good point, did you know also that earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century?</UTT>Yes, we'll have to get it from fusion reactors or from the sun. Whichever is easier. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Yes, great chat!
t_934af75e-5303-4493-a60c-3a1c6e9d2c82</CONV>Did you know that Hugh Laurie is the highest paid actor ever for a TV Drama?</UTT>I did know that.  $700000 per episode for House.</UTT>That's pretty wild! I had no idea he made that much.</UTT>Of course, we have to eliminate Lupus and everybody lies.  LOL  Jim Carrey doesn't do drama anymore.</UTT>Yeah he said because his belief system prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity. I like him better in comedies anyways.</UTT>Good point!  Drama comes from the Greek word for action, yet now we have drama and action as movie categories.</UTT>Yeah that is kind of cool! Michael Caine became an actor because in his high school because all of the prettiest girls were in drama class. I guess it's a good thing he didn't become a cheerleader.</UTT>He was in the UK. Jon Hamm taught drama in his high school and one of his students became a TV star.</UTT>Well, he might have a different perspective I guess. Ellie Kemper was Jon Hamm's student right? I love her on The Office!</UTT>She is entertaining. When Caesar visited Britain in 50 BC he was surprised to find that people raised chickens for entertainment.</UTT>I could see that. Chickens are pretty entertaining. I actually have a few and I like watching them sometimes. They do some funny stuff.</UTT>I think the Brits had chicken fights to the death.  That is outlawed in most countries today.</UTT>That's horrible, there's still people in the South that does it. I'm sad to say that I've been to chicken fights when I was a kid.</UTT>That had to be unpleasant.  Entertainment is any activity that holds the attention or interest of an audience or gives pleasure or delight.</UTT>Did you know that the original NES could only display 54 colors?</UTT>That is not much.  In shopping for 4K TVs I found that they can show millions of colors.  NES was discontinued in 2003 in Japan.</UTT>I loved playing my NES when I was a kid, but I couldn't imagine playing it now.</UTT>I can see that.  There are many festivals around entertainment, music, film and dance for example.  I grew up in Oklahoma and went to the national dance contest for the Cherokee Nation.</UTT>That's really cool. Billy Nye got his break in entertainment by winning a Steve Martin Lookalike Contest.</UTT>That is pure luck.  That impacts many of our lives and we don't even know.  Of course, Ronald Reagan was turned down for a role because he did not have a presidential look.</UTT>That's wild. I guess he showed them.
t_cfd21fee-fa59-4823-b708-ee58ac04ebc3</CONV>hello</UTT>Hi there, do you follow politics much?</UTT>no, I do not know much about politics. But this article is helping me learn some things, My first article is about Michael Cohen with regards to president trump</UTT>Yeah I guess they are everywhere in the news. Do you know who are the three wealthiest presidents in the US?</UTT>yes JFK, Washington, and Jefferson</UTT>Yeah. The president of Indonesia is a pop star on top of being a president</UTT>did you know that elmo is the only non-human to testify before the U.S. congress? I did not know that</UTT>Did not know that either and I am starting to think what elmo testified about.</UTT>yeah no idea what he testified about, will google that later. Interesting, the term congress came from a parley during battle in the late middle ages</UTT>Haha that is cool. Did you know that Fantasy congress actually exists?</UTT>no I did not know</UTT>Yeah and apparently they draft members and get the points based on legislative success</UTT>did you know that there are three subway lines for congressmen to move between the capitol and the house and senate offices?</UTT>Yeah I guess they need to be safe and not ride with the rest of the public. Did you know women were elected to congress before they were able to vote?</UTT>That is so pitifully sad, women have taken way too much crap. Did you know a man in france impersonated a government official and managed to sell the Eiffel tower two times?</UTT>not sure how he pulled that off, but wow. did you know the republicans and the democrats play a game ever year of baseball for over 100 years now?</UTT>Wow, I guess baseball is more popular than I thought. Did you know the norwegian government donated 1 billion dollars to help save the amazon rainforest? I didn't know it was in such need of saving</UTT>Yeah it sure is, the majority of it has been cleared, it is really sad. In Nevada, the government owns 86% of the land</UTT>Did you know wikileaks actually published the government's plan to destroy wikileaks</UTT>Haha they are just too good. On the other hand  it seems the government is granting to much power now that they cannot be persecuted according to the geneva convention</UTT>Something I can't wrap my brain around, is the fact that the presidents guest house is larger than the white house</UTT>I am wondering if they maybe get a lot of guests. Not sure though. Nice chat:)
t_f3d296b2-2513-48eb-8444-d002ad871ae4</CONV>Hi, how are you?</UTT>I am good. I am about to watch space jam. It made lots of money</UTT>I never saw that one. Was it any good?</UTT>Its with Michael jordan. Shaq only made 1 3 point shot ever.</UTT>Really? I know there was not an emphasis on the 3 ball then but only 1?</UTT>Only one. I did not know the NBA been around since 1946</UTT>It was invented by Naismith, the losingest coach in Kansas basketball history! Change the rules so you win more!\</UTT>Thats right. Most of the players go broke after retirement. They should save money.</UTT>I know. In 39 of the 50 states the highest paid state employee is the football or basketball coach.</UTT>wow. The chicago cubs Won the world series a few years ago. Thats my team.</UTT>Nice. When did they win it?</UTT>2016. They were the 1st to win back to back, but they did win again after that</UTT>They won in 2017 too? Wow,that's impressive.</UTT>A girl pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig.</UTT>Wow, that is impressive. Baseball managers wear uniforms in case they have to play. Can you imagine maddon playing?</UTT>so Derek Jeter thinks Bryant Gumbel is weak lol</UTT>No. I saw that interview on real sports and it was so goofy. It was almost flirting... Really weird.</UTT>JETER has a way of talking lol</UTT>I guess but since he has been with the marlins, he has stepped in it a lot. Not with the yankees though.</UTT>I like that Tim duncan finished school before the NBA. That was smart.</UTT>Yeah. I think it also helped in providing him with a well rounded basketball game too!</UTT>I do think that no one shold play on Christmas day.
t_71f4b053-74a2-426a-b47a-6bb8b16abaec</CONV>I wonder what the media would say about Teddy Rosevelt and Quincy Adams not using a Bible at their inaugurals today</UTT>They would probably applaud for the most part.  I find it amazing that Jefferson cut out the supernatural parts of the Bible.</UTT>Yes and apple and evil meant the same thing. The Bible is complex</UTT>I teach it every week.  One can see why an apple meant evil because of the Garden of Eden.  Did you know that the New Testament was written in Greek even though Christ spoke Aramaic?</UTT>I did not know that. Interesting. What I did find amazing was that the Tower of Babel is in Iraq. Ha.</UTT>Yes.  There are many similar towers in that area.  I did not know the building might still stand.</UTT>I found the funniest thing was president banana. Ha. I wonder if it was real or a nickname?</UTT>I am surprised that the 3 wealthiest presidents are JFK, Washington and Jefferson.  I would have thought that Trump would be in the top 3.</UTT>I know that jfk had the combined family income of both parents. And that is most likely in 1960 dollars too</UTT>True.  But Trump showed a net worth of over $10 billion on the financial statement.  Not only is the White House smaller than his place at Trump Tower, the residential part is smaller than the guest house of the President.</UTT>what is amazing to me and what would not work today politically is the runner up becoming the vice president. Incredible</UTT>I know.  We have enough political discord already.  Someone would argue with the President more often if the VP was of the opposite party.</UTT>I was able to see where the vice presidents has offices, in the Old Executive Office Building. Not a prize. Ha</UTT>To change the subject, have you been to any concerts in the venues of various sizes that exist?</UTT>I have gone to a concert in the New Orleans Superdome. Incredible. Glad that it was not to see Creed. I wonder what they did that was so very bad that they needed to be sued?</UTT>I don't know.  Only 4 people sued them, but if 4 went through with it, perhaps 1000 felt the same.</UTT>The Ramones played over two thousand concerts. I blame them for the 80s. Is it too late to sue them? And do you think that Pink Floyd was worried about vesiuvius exploding again when they did their so called "live " concert in 1972?</UTT>I think it must be exhausting to play the same songs every night.  So the over 2200 concerts by the Ramones must have been so tiring for them.  Nice thought on Pink Floyd.  The odds were good that it would not explode that particular night.</UTT>Do you have any idea who Linkin Park is? I cannot remember them at all.</UTT>It was a rock band in the late 1990's.   I can't name a single song however.  324 is almost a concert every night.  That's what they did in 2001.</UTT>The one question that I have is does the president of Indonesia have talent enough to put out 3 albums, or did he just torture his people my making them listen to him make them.</UTT>I would guess he had some talent.  He could force one album, but if it were ridiculed, I don't think he would do 2 more.  Nice talking with you!
t_992ec448-2d19-4e83-b5de-443ec7665a57</CONV>Hi there, do you know much about the Presidents?</UTT>I know some things. I know that I would liked to have gone to an Obama era state dinner. They sounded like amazing parties!</UTT>Yeah it sure did. Did you know the president of Indonesia is a pop star</UTT>I've heard that! Apparently he or she released multiple albums while still in office. I imagine they got a lot done in a day.</UTT>It seems that way. DO you know who the wealthiest US presidents are?</UTT>I know Washington and Jefferson were. And JFK, as I recall. I wonder where their wealth came from? Is it because they were in on the ground floor of the country?</UTT>Maybe, I assume they must have had a lot of land. Plus we have to consider inflation into that equation</UTT>Exactly. And they didn't have second careers as pop stars to fall back on. Nor did they have catchy nicknames, like the president of Zimbabwe, President Banana.</UTT>I know right? Speaking of the president, did you know that the white house is smaller than the guest house?</UTT>I'd love to see that guest house! Maybe after a state dinner at the White House in the East Room, or the State Dining Room, or on the South Lawn, one might retire to the guest house.</UTT>Yeah maybe. Wonder if that is the case in Ireland and France where there are white houses too</UTT>That's really curious. I wonder if those white houses also have solar panels?</UTT>Yeah I wonder too. Good thing Bush brought them back to the white house here.</UTT>I remember being shocked that Regan removed the ones that Carter had had installed. There's no reason to move backward, though, I mean, they still use floppy disks to store files, so maybe technology isn't a serious focus sometimes.</UTT>I guess or I wonder if that has to do with security somehow, not sure. Roosevelt on the other hand did not allow Christmas trees there</UTT>I suppose Roosevelt didn't have an artificial tree! I had no idea that he was such a serious conservationist. Good on him.</UTT>Yeah I guess. DO you know how the VP used to be elected prior to 1805?</UTT>I didn't. I always thought they were the person who came in second in an election.</UTT>Yeah, not sue how that would have worked today really</UTT>It would probably lessen partisanship. It might make people more willing to see the other side. I think they should go back to the early rules!</UTT>Yeah, it would be interesting. Nice chatting with you
t_d7dca68f-0bd3-477b-8de6-439077c9c673</CONV>I am glad that the Government is back for the next three weeks.</UTT>Me too, its a relief, hope things can settle now, did you hear the news about Alan Diaz?</UTT>Therefore, we need to hurry up for our tax refunds! What happened?</UTT>Well it seems like he died at age 71, it can seem old but it was still surprising.</UTT>What caused his death?</UTT>I think he dies out of natural causes, what makes his famous is the picture he captured of that kid, Elian Gonzales.</UTT>What was Elian Gonzales known for? Was he a prodigy?</UTT>No, he was a kid and Alan Diaz took a photo of him in a moment of distress, he earned a Pulitzer Prize because of the photo, a soldier is like pointing a gun at him and the response of the kid is of terror</UTT>That is sad. Every picture has a symbolism.</UTT>I agree, but behind every picture there is a history as well, Alan Diaz spent a lot of time in Cuba and this boosted his career.</UTT>Symbolism and representation of history. He risked his life out there as a photographer.</UTT>He did, but maybe retirement was the biggest risk he ever took as he died a few years later, I think maybe retirement killed him</UTT>He wanted to continue his career. Why did he have to retire then?</UTT>I'm not sure he wanted to continue it, but from personal experience once someone retires passion gets lost and that could kill you, so changing the subject a bit you know that Trumps guest house is bigger than the White House?</UTT>That is sad. To be honest, his ideas are different.</UTT>I don't agree with much of his ideas either, I think we made a mistake when he got elected but oh well there's not much we can do now.</UTT>It's ridiculous with the wall. This caused the government to shut down. Imagine those people who have families need money to provide for them.</UTT>I know, its a terrible situation and for absurd reasons, at least his not making pop albums with his time in office like the president of Indonesia.</UTT>Speaking of pop albums, I believe that Kanye West is siding with Trump?</UTT>He is? well Kanye isn't the best person to ask lol, his had a lot of controversies during the past years.</UTT>Nice chatting with you.
t_8fc841ae-e1da-4be5-be91-583b6e92c770</CONV>hey did you know that teh president of Japan is a scientist! thats crazy</UTT>Yeah!  I think Trump is a mad scientist. You know, the only scientist to walk on the moon was Harrison Schmidt? But then he lost the keys to the rover, and now he is still up there searching for them...</UTT>wow that is interesting, and ya Akihito who is the emperor still publishes papers today</UTT>Nice, but does he know where his car keys are located? You know, by the age of 6 years old, future scientist John vo Neumann could divide two 0 digit numbers in his head? And converse in Greek? Now that is an overachiever!</UTT>that is crazy! what a genius, do you know Harvard? Well I guess they stored a GIF of a galloping horse in some bacteria's DNA for some reason ahha</UTT>Gotta put it somewhere, right? The internet is getting too busy.  The www was created in 1989, and now it is too full to hold any more gif images...</UTT>wow that is interesting, do you watch football at all?</UTT>Canadian or American?</UTT>well I was thinking american haha, but it could be either, their pay structure is very interesting</UTT>I liked it better when bowlers were paid more than football players. Maybe if they bowled wearing helmets?</UTT>ya that would have been an interesting time to live, kind of like the highest scoring football game which was 222-0!</UTT>Was that the Georgia Tech--Cumberland game? That would have been fun to watch, if you were a GT fan!</UTT>haha ya, and if you were a Cumberland fan you'd probably want to run away haha!</UTT>That virtual yellow line that ESPN put on our TV screens had not been invented yet, so I bet the referees were quite busy moving yardline markers!</UTT>that is a great invention, do you like the patriots? they ahve a player that has never fumbled the ball</UTT>Amazing! He must have gone to the library and read a good book on how not to fumble the ball. You know, there are more libraries than McDonalds drive thru windows in this country? Yet I have never seen a person reading a library book at McDonalds. Why is that?</UTT>ha that's a good question, libraries are very important and it's good to know that a man used a library to prove his innocence and then became a lawyer</UTT>I'll bet he uses his new-found skill as a lawyer to help others falsely imprisoned now?</UTT>yes I hope so, I think it's funny that no matter what book is published, the government of norway will buy 100 copies, so you're guaranteed some sales haha</UTT>I'd write a book entitled, "How to get the givernment to buy your opinions"</UTT>haha well definitely if you do that write a childrens book, they buy 1500 copies if thats the case!
t_da82e56b-70a4-4cb8-b264-daacddb60ba5</CONV>Do you keep up with any celebrities?</UTT>Not really, most of them are complete idiots.  I do remember the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy skit.  The Burt Reynolds character was hilarious.</UTT>Yeah, that's true. I don't think ive seen that one, but I have watched a few episodes of SNL.</UTT>I think he was very confident but didn't give well thought out answers.  I'm not sure but there was a rumor that SNL stole the skit from SCTV. Remember Martin Short?</UTT>Yeah, I remember him in Captin Ron and a few other movies!</UTT>Originally they wanted to do an old Burt R, but later opted for a 1970's version.</UTT>That's interesting. Have you seen the new Aladdin trailer? Robin williams was one of the first actors in the first Aladdin to start the trend of celebrities voice performers.</UTT>No I haven't seen it.  Did you ever watch the older Burt Reynolds movies like Deliverance and Smokey and the Bandit?</UTT>I haven't seen that one. Pixar has a secret room often visited by celebrities. I wonder what is in it.</UTT>I wouldn't know... I do know Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode.  Crazy...</UTT>I can't even imagine making that kind of money for such little amount of time. Lebron James is supposedly right after her in terms of money being made</UTT>He's not my favorite.  Carol Burnett on the other hand was cool -- she was the 1st celebrity to make an appearance on Sesame Street.</UTT>That is pretty cool and monumental. Do you like to watch tv?</UTT>Sometimes...  I watch the Simpsons now and then. It always has Bart it seems.</UTT>Yeah, apparently he is in or mentioned in all episodes but one.</UTT>I can't believe that there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon.  I wish other shows were as prolific.</UTT>Yeah, but Pokemon was a staple of a lot of childhoods. I believe it was supposed to have ended some time ago.</UTT>It didn't seem too.  Wow, an iPhone has more computing power that the US nuclear missile defense system. Scary...</UTT>That's a lot of power inside such a tiny thing. It's is scary how powerful basic technology can be. I wonder about the things we've never been told about.</UTT>Like why NY's area code is 212.  Simple explanation... It was easier to dial with rotary phones...</UTT>That's pretty interesting. Unicef will donate a day of clean water in need for every minute you don't use your cell phone. I wonder how you do that..</UTT>That's nice of Unicef. Thanks for the chat.

With the little cartoon deer?</UTT>Yeah!  lol It was more sad than scary for me.</UTT>Oh I thought you meant that Steven King wrote Bambi.  I see what you mean now.</UTT>Oh lol oops,  I guess I didn't explain that correctly lol no Bambi is a Disney movie lol</UTT>Well yes.  Walt Disney was a nut too, come to think of it.</UTT>Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching horror films?</UTT>Well yes, I just read that in the box next to this.</UTT>Cool!  Isn't weird how some child actors or actresses don't even know what kind of movie they are in.  Like The boy from the Shinning never knew it was a scary movie.</UTT>I've never seen it.  I would probably poop myself.</UTT>It is a pretty scary movie.  Did you know some of the zombie sounds eating humans in Walking Dead are just made by a man eating friend chicken.</UTT>I never understood why people like horror movies.   I don't like them one bit.</UTT>Maybe they like feeling the thrills and chills.</UTT>I suppose it must be something like that.  Well, to each his own I guess.  Did you read the part in the third section about helium?</UTT>Yes, but sometimes we do not get the same stuff.</UTT>It's a strange assortment of information this time</UTT>Its so weird how the earth has changed,  when it was first formed each day would only be about 5 hours long!  That is so short!</UTT>Well, keep in mind that was several billion years ago.</UTT>Yes.  Nice chatting.

I think the bromance the hangover is on par with H and K as well!</UTT>I hear Kung Fu Hustle is funny, Bill Murray thinks of it as a great achievement</UTT>I saw that...it is so wacky.  It is definately a great form of Entertainment.</UTT>3rd rock from the sun was really wacky, they actually beat out Seinfield, Friends, and Frasier for best comedy in the 1997 emmys</UTT>I am going to have to binge watch it then lol.  I have seen all episodes of the other three.  I am sure it will capture my attention and give me delight.</UTT>Yea, I wish all the shows nominated for best comedy series were on Netflix, only Friends is</UTT>Sometimes I wonder who makes those crazy calls...probably and entertainment exec who turned Reagan down for a role because he did not look presidential enough lol.</UTT>Lol well I got to go, nice chatting with you
t_410498c8-39a2-4543-9737-df012a0b68ba</CONV>Do you follow politics at all?</UTT>I actually do. My Twitter is full of it, lol. I thought Obama had a PHD, but I guess Wilson was the only president who has one.</UTT>Is it ever.  I also heard the last to speak a foreign language fluently was FDR.</UTT>I also thought Clinton spoke French. Maybe that is Hillary? I think we need to do away with the Electoral College, as there are too many presidents who have been elected...and lost the popular vote.</UTT>Some by as much as 10% I heard.  I agree, go with what the people want.</UTT>I agree. I didn't know Ayn Rand was on Medicare and Social Security, with the way everyone on the right holds her up, I bet they don't know either.</UTT>I didnt know she was either, there is a lot of things the far right doesnt know, for example  what is good for them.</UTT>There is that. Oddly, Nixon propsed a guaranteed minimu m income. Sounds like he may have had more in common with the Dems.</UTT>Yeah, I think in the past people tended to be more in the middle and now there is a huge dividing line.</UTT>I hear the Republican VS Democrat baseball game has been going on since 1909. I didn't know there was a thing, until the shooting a few years ago.</UTT>I must have missed the shooting too.  I think it would be an interesting thing to watch.</UTT>I think the Republicans are up by three games.</UTT>The Dems are getting some younger people in there, they will come back.</UTT>I would like to see AOC on the field, lol. I didn't know JFK voted against the civil rights act.</UTT>AOC is pretty amazing, and I didnt know JFK voted that way either.  I would have always thought he would be for that.  Did you hear about Truman?</UTT>No, I didn't. is he the one the chimpanzee almost beat for Mayor?</UTT>Lol, that is funny but no.  He wouldnt be photographed with Dumbo in 1957 because he didnt want to be associated with Republicans.</UTT>Honestly, that sounds like something trump would do. I keep forgetting that Teddy Roosevelt's party, was The Bull Moose. Fitting, since he basically had a zoo on the white house lawn.</UTT>Yeah, it does sound a bit Trumpish.  Teddy was a big conservationist, so much so he even banned chirstmas trees.</UTT>As an allergy sufferer, I'm in favor of that. There have been 19 republican presidents. I think it's time for a third party.</UTT>I agree with having a third party.  WIth the way the country is moving I am sure one might start to gain power soon.</UTT>We can only hope. It was nice chatting with you, have a wonderful night.
t_c332a640-c879-4fca-a624-8a43e4c7c252</CONV>I've always been a fan of the NBA and basketball, but I never knew that shooting "granny style" is the best technique to score free throws. NBA players refuse to do it because it looks stupid haha.</UTT>I suppose NBA players, maybe all athletes in general, care a lot about how they're perceived by the general public.</UTT>Of course. And I'm sure a man doesn't want to shoot "granny style." There's a lot I would do for $32 million. That's what Iverson's getting when he's 55.</UTT>There are a lot of NFL players that have recently been very public about their views on certain political standpoints. President trump, racism, etc. have all been hot topics. This seems to create a lot of buzz around their names and throws them right into the spotlight. I bet they enjoy it!</UTT>Yeah I agree. And everyone has an opinion they're just dying to express.  I feel like this happens more in football than in other sports, like baseball and tennis.</UTT>Yeah they seem to be thinking more about the game itself rather than the politics surrounding it.</UTT>That's they way it should be. I love tennis. The longest match in tennis history was 11 hours over 3 days. I wonder if that was televised.</UTT>That's incredible! I wonder how they sustained that much energy for such a long stretch of time. For a long time, until 1978 to be exact, tennis players were allowed to use any item as their racket. Can you imagine?! I wonder what some of the strangest items used as "rackets" were.... Boards? Dead salmon? Haha!</UTT>What! I never knew that. What exactly does "any item" entail? How about a baseball bat? They also used a helicopter to dry the grass courts in the '69 US Open.</UTT>Literally any item that could hit a ball over the net, I suppose. A bat would've been hilarious to see! Imagine a tennis ball flying over the net at 50mph. The helicopter trick sounds brilliant! That's a lot of fuel to burn through, though.</UTT>The would have been wild. They should reinstate that rule. I'd like do see someone come in with a loaf of hero bread. That would be entertaining to watch. Everyone has gotten so serious and is always offended these days. We always looked to sports as a form of entertainment but now it's so political.</UTT>I agree. It's nice to have your voice heard, but why should they be heard louder than the average person? Oh well... On a brighter note, did you know that George Clooney had a pet potbellied pig?! His name was Max. Apparently George treated him like a dog. He let him sleep in the bed with him and everything. I wonder if the pig was smelly...</UTT>If I had a pig, I'd probably treat it like a dog too. They are very smart and very clean animals, despite popular though. George Clooney is actually a distant relative of Lincoln too.</UTT>Wow, I always thought they were gross! You must be right though, there are a lot of people getting pigs as pets these days. I had no idea he was a relative of Lincoln! How would you even find out if you were related to someone historical like that? I want to find out!</UTT>Probably follow family your history. I've always wanted to do that myself, but even if I found out I was distantly related to someone like Einstein, what does it really matter? It really wouldn't change my life or make me feel better or worse about myself.</UTT>It would just be something awesome to throw into a conversation I guess. Other than that, pretty useless information- especially considering how fast lineage spreads.</UTT>That is true. I have always liked George Clooney. He also helped fund a satellite that documents war atrocities in Africa.</UTT>Wow! He sure has a lot of money, but he seems to spend it well. He even gave 14 of his close friends each $1 million as a gift. That's pretty admirable!</UTT>Extremely admirable! I need a friend like that! He's the only person ever to be nominated for the Academy Awards in 6 categories. Pretty impressive.</UTT>I do too! Haha! He's a very accomplished guy. He even had a small part in South Park. He was cast as the "voice" for Stan's dog. He was only asked to make dog sounds!</UTT>Get out! That's interesting! Well I have to run! Have a great day!
t_649beb75-e519-480c-bad6-86142197374d</CONV>How's it going, do you watch Horror films? I enjoy watching supernatural one sometimes</UTT>Sometimes.    A Quiet place was pretty scary.</UTT>YEa, Krasinski and Blunt did a great job in A Quiet Place</UTT>What was the name of the family?   I forget.</UTT>In the film they were called the Abbotts</UTT>Thanks for that.     It is amazing how many mainstream movies started as horror films.</UTT>I find it amazing Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie lol</UTT>Perhaps so, but can you imagine ET as a horror film!</UTT>No, I think my childhood would be more ruined than Kings when he watched Bambi</UTT>I also find it Ironic "Scary Movie" (the original name for scream) became the title for one of its parodies.</UTT>Not as strange as Danny from the Shining not realizing he was staring in a horror film as a kid</UTT>True.    Did you like Inception?     That movie also began life as a horror flick.</UTT>Yea Inception was pretty good, Leo and Tom Hardy were great in it</UTT>I agree.   Ellen Page was also great.     I heard it took Christopher Nolan a long time to write that script.</UTT>Sounds like it, I know Brad Pitt and Will Smith declined offers to play Cobb</UTT>I heard the snow fortress was based on some actual building.</UTT>That's pretty cool, did you know the rotating hallway wasn't made with any cgi?</UTT>Pretty amazing the lengths they will go to!    Amazing it was based on a Poe story!</UTT>I never knew that, or that Elon Musk's wife was in Inception either</UTT>Very cool.    On a less serious note, there was a Donald Duck comic with a similar plot years before the film.</UTT>Never knew that. Well I got to go, nice chatting with you
t_0d22777d-11c5-46d4-819f-f948f5182e0b</CONV>Hey there what do you think about the rapper Jay-Z?</UTT>Not a big fan, but he and Beyonce are pretty powerful couple in the entertainment field, I'll give them that.</UTT>Yep I agree with you there. I guess his comeback album known as Kingdom Come was named after a DC Comics mini-series which is cool and nerdy at the same time</UTT>Their album titles are interesting for sure.  Beyonce's Lemonade was referencing her marriage problems.  I guess life gives us all lemons sometimes, no matter how rich or famous we are.</UTT>Haha that's right. It's a good thing to keep in mind for sure. Apparently Jay-Z, The Notorious BIG, Busta Rhymes, and DMX all went to the same high school. That's really a big coincidence</UTT>Wow, that is an amazing coincidence!  It's also amazing how their influence is seen not only in music.  Like Jay-Z's 99 Problems being used to in some law school classes.  Who would have thought?</UTT>Haha yep I did not know that I can tell you that. I never knew that his first album came out in 1996 it was called Reasonable Doubt</UTT>Wow, he has been around for a long time.  I didn't realize that.  I didn't realize he wrote a song for Space Jam either.  Even Bugs Bunny has a Jay-Z connection.</UTT>No I didn't know that. Now I want to watch Space Jam again LOL! Do you listen to any other music? Like Linkin Park for instance</UTT>I like Linkin Park and saw them in concert years ago.  Meteora was a great album.</UTT>Yep they definitely have some good records. They're record Hybrid Theory is the best selling album of the 21st century so far. I wonder if that will hold out or not</UTT>That would be something if it did.  Good music stands the test of time, no doubt.  One of Bob Marley's albums has been on the charts for something like 914 weeks.  That's some durable reggae.</UTT>Wow that's impressive! did you hear about the identical twins from Japan? They released a rap album when they turned 100 I wonder if that's on the charts LOL</UTT>That's awesome!  I wonder what 100 year old Japanese twins rap about?  If they kept it clean, maybe I can find it in Wal-Mart. LOL</UTT>LOL I hope so. But I know that Walmart only stocks "clean"versions of albums so you might be out of luck there LOL</UTT>Good point.  Maybe they have a Facebook page so I could read up on them and their music a little bit.  It seems like everyone has a Facebook page anymore.</UTT>I agree. I have a Facebook page but I don't use it, I only really use it to remind me for birthdays haha. How often do you use Facebook? It's crazy that Myspace had a chance to buy Facebook for only 75 million dollars</UTT>That is crazy.  It's also crazy that one-third of divorce filings contain the word Facebook.  Some people are apparently using it for more than birthday reminders.  Personally, I just like the funny cat videos.</UTT>Haha yep those are good too. Did you know that Mark Zuckerberg is actually colorblind? That's why Facebook is blue, because any other color would be a distraction for him</UTT>I did not know that.  I kind of wondered why they went with blue.  Is it true that Facebook is now worth more than $104 billion?</UTT>Yes, I think at this point it's worth even more than that, and I wish that they still did the free Whopper Facebook promotion, I would gladly unfriend 10 people to get a free Whopper right now LOL
t_002636d2-04eb-48ec-abbf-9e2854ce87f1</CONV>Hi! Did you watch the Super Bowl the other day?</UTT>Yes, Tom brady's jersey from the locker room was stolen. Did you know ?</UTT>Oh I thought that happened a couple years ago? I just know the game was pretty slow, especially for the playoffs. Did you know Brady has never, ever eaten a strawberry? More for me I guess LOL</UTT>Tom brady in NFL history to have won five super bowls and he also won all with a single franchise.</UTT>Oh wow. You know, for all that, the average engineer earns more in a lifetime than the average NFL player. But then, Brady isn't average I guess</UTT>He is the most valuable player in the history. He never eaten strawberry in his entire life.</UTT>Yeah</UTT>You like live music ?</UTT>Yes, I love concerts. My favorites live have been U2 and Peter Gabriel.</UTT>Pink floyd recorded a live concert at ancient time with no audience.</UTT>I don't think it was in ancient times, but the venue dated to classical Roman times.</UTT>Sure! You like classical and rapping ?</UTT>I am more into indie music and rock. Although not all rock. I side with the Creed audience members who sued because they were so bad live</UTT>What is your favourite sports ?</UTT>I love ice hockey. I think football is the most popular sport in the US but I'm not sure.</UTT>Foot is my favourite. The NFL has no written rule against female players. women would in fact be allowed if they met the eligibility requirements.</UTT>That's interesting. I wonder if someone will make it in as a kicker someday? They don't treat cheerleaders very well. The Saints even ban them from eating at the same restaurants as players.</UTT>Yes, NFl uses tracking chips embeddded in player shoulder pads to record a players move on the field.</UTT>That's very interesting, actually.</UTT>Bill belichick lists tom brady on the injury report every week, even though he shows no sign of injury.</UTT>It's a clever move. Belichick is pretty cage-y when it comes to giving out information. Some reporters compare his code to the Omerta of the mafia.</UTT>Its very interesting. Who is your favourite musician ?</UTT>Oh like I said, I love U2 and Peter Gabriel. What about you?</UTT>Peter Gabriel is my favourite.</UTT>Oh cool, we have something in common! What is your favorite type of concert? I know some people really prefer recitals.</UTT>Symphony is my favourite. What about you ?</UTT>I just love the accessibility of rock. It's so raw</UTT>Awesome! I have a nice chat.</UTT>Yeah it was nice talking to you, too. I guess football and music kind of do go together in some ways LOL.</UTT>Yes, Its quite interesting.</UTT>They both happen in big stadiums sometimes for example. They can both take a physical toll. Linkin Park played over 324 concerts in one year after their debut album hit it big</UTT>Amazing! Its make ourself stress-free and make happier.</UTT>Yeah, music is pretty great when you're just listening. no stress</UTT>Yes, most of the time it make ourself calm and patience.</UTT>Not the Ramones, though. I mean they punked out for 20 years straight at one point LOL</UTT>You ever played football in school days ?</UTT>Yes, one of our teachers made us play. I actually have to go now, but it was great speaking with you. Have a great night :)
t_9713eb0c-294d-4dff-ab14-11e3dcb8fb19</CONV>Hey! Did you know that there was a hockey player who was traded for $1.00 in 1993, and went on to win 4 Stanley Cups?</UTT>Wow that's awesome! Such a surprise I bet haha. What is your favorite hockey team?</UTT>The NY Islanders! How about you?</UTT>I really like the Red Wings. I also like the Penguins a lot haha. It's because my dad's from Pittsburgh originally.. Why do you think Canada is so good at hockey?</UTT>That's cool. I'm originally from NY so that explains my preference for the Islanders. Canada is so good at hockey because it is their national sport. They're the only country with 2 national sports,</UTT>I think you're right there national sports are lacrosse and ice hockey. I guess Hockey is referred in other countries as field hockey. Only in about five countries total is it referred to as just hockey</UTT>Kind of like football/soccer I guess. On average hockey players can lose up yo 8lbs in one game. I know they must sweat like crazy.</UTT>Wow that does sound crazy. I could use that that sounds like a great workout though haha. It's interesting that they can use the same court for basketball and hockey and they just switch the floors out</UTT>Yeah I thought that was wild too, I learned that at an Islanders game because they share the stadium with the Brooklyn Nets. In 39 of 50 states the highest paid state employee is a college football or bball coach.</UTT>That's interesting I didn't know that. What do you think about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? I love how he was so good that he got the dunk banned in basketball haha</UTT>He's super tall! Which would be fitting for the New Zealand team, who are nicknamed "the tall blacks."</UTT>Haha I guess. That name is pretty crazy. Definitely offensive over here haha. Did you know that the Supreme Court has a basketball court on the top floor?</UTT>Yeah pretty offensive, but pretty accurate. I did know that! And they call it the "highest court in the land." Also an accurate name. haha</UTT>Haha I love that name. Do you know that the creator of the game basketball was a losing coach for his university? He's the only using coach in the whole history of the University actually haha</UTT>That's sad and ironic haha. Did you know that all Cornell students must pass a swim test before they can graduate?</UTT>Oh wow that's interesting. I know that in our school you had to pass a swimming test as well. But we live in Michigan and are surrounded by lakes so maybe that's why haha</UTT>Maybe! I feel like that's a basic survival skill that everyone should possess. I knew a few people when I graduated who couldn't swim and I didn't understand how or why.</UTT>Wow are you serious? I don't know why it's so hard for people to swim haha, did you hear about the way to swim where you bind your hands and legs, you end up swimming like a dolphin and that's apparently a thing that people do haha</UTT>I can swim well, but if I did that, I'd probably drown. I used to swim on a swim team and having a good swimsuit was important. There's a swimsuit that was banned by the Olympics because 94% of all races in 2008 were won by people who wore it.</UTT>Haha that's wild! I wonder if that would help to make me really good at swimming haha. Very crazy that the United States has as many gold medals in swimming as the rest of the world combined. We are really dominant at swimming I guess haha</UTT>Definitely thank swimmers like Phelps for that! He had a big hand in getting a bunch of gold metals when he used to compete in the Olympics.</UTT>Oh yeah you're right. He's definitely awesome! Did you know that the Native Americans used a very strange front crawl swimming stroke when they beat the British at the olympics one year
t_937b50ff-43f8-470f-bc51-871a4deb49ef</CONV>Do you like Trump as president?</UTT>Well that was a nice start haha. No I don't, do you?</UTT>I dont either, I disagree with the controversy he generates and with many of his attitudes as well</UTT>Well said! Who would you say your favorite president was?</UTT>Mine was Obama, what about yours?</UTT>Same here! Did you know the top three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson?</UTT>I didnt know that, so Trump is not on that list? thats kind of strange dont you think</UTT>They must have had much more money than Trump has!</UTT>Yeah it doesnt make sense to me but could be, so have you heard of president Banana from Zimbabwe?</UTT>I haven't, cool name though. I don't think it's as cool as the Indonesian president though!</UTT>Why is that? do you know any interesting facts about him?</UTT>He released 3 pop albums while in office. That is awesome lol.</UTT>He did? I wonder if he is a talented pop star then, he must do an album with Trump that would be awesome.</UTT>It would be the biggest, the greatest, the best! Did you know there are twin white houses in Ireland and France?</UTT>I didnt know that no, I wonder if they have the same size as ours and also who lives there.</UTT>I wonder that too! Can you believe our white house still uses floppy disks?</UTT>That actually makes sense I hear floppy disks are really hard to hack or impossible to hack so it makes sense to keep sensible info on them just in case.</UTT>That makes sense haha. I'm sure hackers these days don't even know what they are lol.</UTT>You have a good point lol, did you hear about the incident in the White House back in November 11, 2011?</UTT>I did! didn't it take secret service four days to realize that somebody shot at the white house?</UTT>Yeah it took four days for the secret service to realize that I bet someone got fired that day</UTT>I'm guessing a whole lot of people lol. Anyways, nice chatting with you, have a great night!

I think the article is dedicated mostly to parents as the main topic is focused toward the end of the school year.</UTT>I do have kids. Do you have kids?</UTT>I have kids as well, and I know how much they look forward to summer vacation lol,</UTT>Oh yeah! My son loves summer vacation. Although he thinks he can just sit around and watch tv. He's so naive...</UTT>I my kids are naive as well, there are many questions that I ask myself as a parent though, I think its important for parents to reflect and try to improve things for our kids.</UTT>I agree. I have a hard time saying "no" to tv. I do say it but it is just so easy to let them watch tv and leave me alone while I work.</UTT>I agree, its hard for parents after all we dont get summer vacation lol, still I try to find time to make my kids grow.</UTT>Yeah. I just had my son next to me at my desk doing math homework. I hope I set a good example, at least...</UTT>I think it is, I try to reward my kids efforts that seems to work with me, I also try to limit their social media use among other things.</UTT>Mine are 5 & 7 so I have not had to cross the social meida bridge yet but I am not looking forward to it. Any tips?</UTT>Yeah, keeping track of their social media pages, giving them privacy but filtering them as there is a lot of violence, sexual language among other dangers out there.</UTT>Do you force them to Friend/follow you? I am so worried that technology will pass me by and they will be jerks without me knowing...</UTT>No not really, I just take a look at their activities once in a while I try to give them privacy but Im just too worried about the dangers of the internet.</UTT>Me too. I think my son has a great heart and wants to do well. I think he will be corrupted though and could be talked into poor choices...</UTT>That is my fear as well, I want my son to read more so Im buying him some novels, do you have any recomendations?</UTT>Not really. I read a lot of business books. How old is he?</UTT>He is 11 years old, do you think Starship Troopers could be a good choice? what are your thoughts</UTT>I think so. Although the movie is not appropriate for that age. I would suggest finance books too like Rich Dad, Poor Dad.</UTT>Ok I will look into those options thanks, you know the record of reading is like 4700 words per minute</UTT>Wow! Nice chatting with you!
t_a303e8d7-e8b3-4750-8810-6059218f8d33</CONV>Hello! The article I read was about the film Black Panther</UTT>The Black Panther movie was predicted to be a really high opening movie.</UTT>There were alt-right groups which tried to form campaigns to leave negative reviews for Black Panther on rottentomatoes.com</UTT>That group didn't get a lot of support for their group to give it a rotten score.</UTT>A similar effort was attempted previously for the film The Last Jedi.</UTT>The rotten tomatoes said they wanted a place to debate movies, but they didn't condone hate speech.</UTT>The people behind the hate speech didn't like how Disney was offering films that had diverse casts, including women in leading roles.</UTT>Apparently Daisy Ridley as Rey had a feminist agenda. If you don't like a movie just don't go to it.</UTT>Black Panther also had women in prominent roles.</UTT>Apparently they don't like Disney and its direction.</UTT>Rotten Tomatoes tried to monitor the opinions left and limit the input of the hate group if they posted hate speech.</UTT>They ended up shutting it down though.</UTT>The movie Black Panther went on to be very successful.</UTT>It was based on the Marvel Universe, and lots of the 17 films set there were successful.</UTT>An example was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2, which was very successful and made over $863 million the previous year.</UTT>It had a huge opening as well, $146 million domestic.  They predicted Black Panther to have opening number very close to that.</UTT>Black Panther is the richest superhero, worth more than both Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined.</UTT>Isn't he crowned a king? Kings are always rich.</UTT>Yes he was crowned king after his father's death, and got all his wealth.</UTT>Of course, if his adversary who challenged him had won, things would not have turned out to be so lucrative for him.</UTT>True. But now he can use his wealth to end his country's isolationist practices and help others in need throughout the world.</UTT>I wonder if Chadwick Boseman will be in another film as black panther.
t_835de032-d614-44b9-8605-88abca4c519e</CONV>I think the rescuers that helped that boy are really brave.</UTT>yes. they did a great job</UTT>I think that Jesse Hernandez learned a lesson as well and he won't be playing around so recklessly with his cousins anytime soon, can you imagine how worried his family was!</UTT>Yes.  I think that lesson will stay with him for the rest of his life.</UTT>For sure, you know more than 100 rescuers worked really hard to find him, it was a dangerous scenario and they were against the clock</UTT>Yep. That took a combination of diligence and luck.</UTT>I heard the rescuers were really happy when they found Jessy, he was in a pipe that was four feet wide.</UTT>Yes the rescue was tough it took a lot to find him and they said they were overwhelmed with joy</UTT>Did you saw the footage with dozens of firefighters in the struggle? I saw a lot of those images in social media and also on tv</UTT>No. But I read about the ordeal on the internet.</UTT>Oh I see, well do you like to watch TV?</UTT>Sure. I am a big sports fan. Baseball, basketball and football</UTT>what about soccer? do you like soccer</UTT>Not a big fan. I will watch it very rarely</UTT>I see, I am a big fan, did you know soccer makes more money than football, baseball, golf, hockey and basketball combined!</UTT>I have heard that. But soccer is played all over the world. Baseball and football as well as basketball started in America and have caught on in recent years. But they are in catch up mode as far as the rest of the world</UTT>I guess that's a good point, it is played  in over 200 countries so that must be the reason, it's curious how soccer got its name</UTT>I guess you could dig around on the internet and find the answer</UTT>Yeah I guess that would be a good idea, theres a lot that can be found on the internet, for intance there is a variation of soccer with 3 teams facing each other at the same time</UTT>Thats interesting. I have never heard of that.</UTT>It is, and I just looked why its called soccer and its because soccer is slang for association football, so it makes sense now.

Nintendo did a great job.</UTT>Yeah I was sad when they discontinued it in 2003</UTT>I guess the newer systems eclipsed the NES. that is still a long run.</UTT>Weird how they discontinued in Sept.  Why not another xmas?</UTT>Christmas is different in Japan. Sept could be the end of a model year.</UTT>Thats true.  How about albums, you listen to music?</UTT>I like to listen to jazz albums. I was listening to Bill Evans recently. He is great for working and thinking.</UTT>There is an album called the dark side of the moon released 40 years ago and still best seller</UTT>Dark Side was a huge album. Have you ever tried Dark Side of Oz?</UTT>No who is that by?</UTT>Ok, you start the movie Wizard of Oz. at a certain point, you turn on Dark Side and it acts like the soundtrack. it synchs up well, ive heard.</UTT>Oh maybe I can find that on MP3 format now?</UTT>Maybe. i dont know. you would have to find the starting point for the movie.</UTT>Oh I thought it could be a soundtrack.  Did you know japanese twins recorded an album at 100 years old?</UTT>At that age, what else are they going to do? Make an album of complaints about arthritis and pensions and grand children.</UTT>Haha...good one.  Take care and have a good night</UTT>Have a good night!</UTT>same to you

I guess reading too much can ruin a marriage?</UTT>Yeah the internet ruined the library I'm afraid.  Yeah I guess, or at least back in 1938.</UTT>I just read someone lament about missing issues of the New Yorker.  This person needs to get a life.</UTT>Yeah they sure do, but people will get crazy over just about anything.</UTT>So true.  The person was also lamenting about TV news using a single open quote instead of an apostrophe.  Such a hard life...</UTT>Wow, yeah talk about a rough life, sounds like a lot of hard time spent on the couch.</UTT>Hee, hee.  Funny, I think you're dead on with that.  Maybe this person can get some help from the Washington Post.</UTT>Yeah that sounds like a good amount of money raised.</UTT>I hope it makes it to those that need it.  I personally don't trust WaPo at all. If the 18th century people read their news, they wouldn't worry about a moral panic because of novels.</UTT>Yeah you might be right about that.  Now people just use the internet to create the panic.</UTT>Very true and astute again!  I just learned that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps is called a "hamburger".  Makes me hungry...</UTT>That is too funny, yeah I'm hungry too.  Did you know there is 3g coverage on top of Everest?</UTT>I hard that.  How many people need that there?  Makes as much sense as Starship Troopers being recommended reading for the military...</UTT>Yeah that doesn't sound necessary, and right what a stupid choice.</UTT>I guess Ender's Game as suggested reading for the USMC is better.  At least it isn't dominated by giant bugs.</UTT>Yeah that is very true, I wonder who is in charge of selecting this, it can't be by group vote.</UTT>I don't know.  It may be a vote.  Lot's of youngsters in the DoD.  Did you know the Earth is running out of helium?  It will by the end of this century!</UTT>Yeah I think I read that a few years back, that will be too bad!  I wonder what all the helium business will do to replace it?</UTT>Another reason to develop fusion.  Did you know when the Earth first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long?  Lot's of paid overtime?</UTT>Yeah right, I wonder if the days are slowly getting longer as time goes by as well, just too slow for us to notice. Most likely hundreds of thousands of years it will be 25 hrs long.</UTT>I guess so.  We won't be hear to see it, unless reincarnation is real.  Thanks! You were a great chat partner!
t_389dbdda-0b3d-4155-9d1d-f754b1519695</CONV>Good Morning! How are you today?</UTT>Great. I'm just surfing the internet.  I think I'm addicted because of the constant novelty from clicking links.</UTT>That really is an addiction! Can you believe there is 3g cell service on top of Mt Everest?</UTT>Wow. So I can't get away from my addiction even there.</UTT>Not even there lol. Are you one of the 7 percent of people that read the full terms when buying a product or service?</UTT>No. I'm in the 93. I get distracted by the hamburger button.</UTT>That is easy to get distracted with. Makes me hungry too. Do you like to read?</UTT>Well I read on the internet. I like bad poetry.</UTT>Didn't CS Lewis and Tolkien hold "you laugh you lose" competitions for that?</UTT>I would definitely lose. Do you think its moral to read novels?</UTT>I do! I can't believe that not too long ago they caused a moral panic! I wonder why?</UTT>probably for reasons similar to the internet. I bet some people would like to see the whole thing burn down. At least that's what a library in Alexandria thinks.</UTT>How can one burn the internet down lol? Maybe because iPhones have more computer power than the entire US nuclear ICBM deterrent?</UTT>Interesting. The military loves Starship Troopers, so I'm sure they raise their computing power</UTT>They also recommend Ender's Game. Have you read or seen the movies to both?</UTT>i read them in 10 minutes after taking a course from Anne Jones</UTT>You can read 4700 words per minute? I think that is impressive haha.</UTT>Yeah. But I still don't understand the full terms when buying a product on the internet</UTT>Haha you should be the seven percent for sure! Anyways, it was nice chatting have a great day!</UTT>Nice chatting with you. Hopefully UNICEF will donate some money because we werent on our cells.</UTT>I agree! Take care!
t_08db71f9-f24c-4bb7-88b5-d4cf27c8e4ab</CONV>Hi. Are you a fan of the NFl?  Did you know, I heard recently that they don't have any written rules against women playing the game.  I wonder if women will play in the future.</UTT>Hi! Yes! I didn't know that. I'm a huge Giants fan but i love Gronk. I would  kill my brother if he called to complain about my job though to a radio station!</UTT>Did that happen?  What did he say when he complained?  And yeah, by the way, i would kill my brother too!</UTT>I'm not sure but sounds crazy and he should know better, he played football too for Dallas!</UTT>The brother played football for Dallas?  He should definitely know better then.  The Patriots are a winning team.  What could he complain about?</UTT>Agreed! But people get so passionate about football which is funny because the average game only has 11 minutes of play time! Poeple spend way more time researching and talking about it.</UTT>That is definitely true!  The NFL itself spends more time researching. I mean, they've got tracking chips in each players shoulder pads to record movements on the field.</UTT>That's pretty smart!! i didn't know footballs had them as well, must make coaching and planning plays much better and easier.</UTT>Or complicated. Can you imagine having to go over data from footballs, shoulder pads, previous games, the players themselves, etc before you can make a game plan?</UTT>That's true. I guess i've never played football. My best friend was a cheer leader though. It's funny that the Saints' cheerleaders cannot eat at the same restaurant as any NFL player and even have to leave</UTT>You know I've heard about that and I have to agree.  I think that is a very outdated rule.  If anything, they should make it where the second to arrive has to leave regardless of whether it's a player or cheerleader.</UTT>I agree!! Do you watch football? I hate the Patriots as a team but i do love game of thrones. It's funny that the author calls them the lannisters of the nfl.</UTT>I do watch foot ball and I too hate the Patriots.  I know Bill Belichick is the winningest coach in postseason but to me he is also the one that cheats the most.</UTT>I hate him passionately. I'm a huge Giants fan and i still don't fully follow the super bowl 46 story of the giants not wanting to score</UTT>I've never heard about that. I am a Cowboys fan myself.  Hey, did you know that even though the patriots have a bunch of wins they are tied with the Buffalo Bills for super bowl losses?</UTT>no but that's so funnY!! do you ever listen to games on the radio? I only do when im driving really</UTT>I do when i have to go somewhere I don't want to miss what's happening.  Radios are pretty handy.  I've heard you can hear storms on Jupiter on them but I don't know how to do it.</UTT>I didn't know that! Canada requires that at least 40% of music be canadian, i ddnt even know there was that much music from canada!</UTT>I think it's weird they'd have to have a law about it.  I wonder if the U.S. has a law about music on the radio.  I do wish they could be more educational like a radio station in Finland. It broadcasts a weekly news program in latin.</UTT>I agree. There is a wesbite where you can download 1000s of classic radio dramas for free, maybe you could find more educational ones on a site like that</UTT>I would like to. I love some of the old radio dramas!
t_4cc63314-2a1d-4cc0-a605-4613ef3c399a</CONV>Hello</UTT>Good morning!  Hope you are doing well today</UTT>Im doing great today. Are you an avid reader?</UTT>I used to read a lot more, before kids, and I really would like to get into it again.  Super fiction was my favorite genre - like Tom Robbins.  How about you?</UTT>Yeah thats about the same with me. I mainly just read my son a bedtime story every night. Lol.</UTT>That's fantastic - my kids read way more than I do these days, and I'm OK with it!  It's awesome to see kids get lost in a good book</UTT>My son is only two, but he loves to read at night before bed.</UTT>That's a great age!  My kids are 10.  Can you imagine that 200+ years ago reading novels was discouraged and even considered a immoral?!?!</UTT>That nuts. I heard that the record for speed reading is 4700 words per minute. Thats pretty fast if you ask me.</UTT>That's very fast!  I wonder how much a person remembers/retains reading that fast?  My Mom can read an entire novel on a long plane ride - but 4700 wpm is unreal!</UTT>I have enough trouble with reading comprehension while reading at a regular pace. I dont know how they do it.</UTT>Reminds me of the Matrix, where he downloads information into his brain and is instantly an expert.  I'd rather take my time and be entertained and relaxed!</UTT>Ye. Thats me as well. So what other forms of entertainment do you like.</UTT>Of course with kids, we love watching movies, playing games and doing sports.  My kids just got an old Wii - I remember playing the old Nintendo games when I was a kid</UTT>Yeah me to. Were you aware that the nintendo could only display 54 colors.</UTT>I didn't know that, but I do remember the original Atari and I think that was only 8 colors!  Kids today are so spoiled with technology</UTT>So true. When I was a kid, we had 3 channels on the tv and I was probably 10 before we got a nintendo. My two year old already has a phone and a tablet.</UTT>Right!  I remember the 3 channels and they signed off at night and it was just static or color bars.  My kids have tablets, laptops, smart watches - it's amazing how far we've come in 30 years</UTT>I dont miss the days of that old tv antenna. Remember when you were watching something you liked and the President had a press conference and it was on every channel.</UTT>Breaking News!  I thought Ronald Regan would have been the last celebrity who became president.  I had no idea how wrong I was!</UTT>Lol. Well its been a good chat. Im gonna have to get some stuff done though. Have a good one.
t_dfb13e37-73dd-44ea-9e27-56afec5c7c06</CONV>Hello do you like dance?4</UTT>I do not like to dance. i am a terrible dancer.</UTT>Did you know bruce lee used to dance?</UTT>I bet he did. he was a real ladies man.</UTT>Yeah he won a cha cha competition in 1958</UTT>He probably had a great sense of rhythm. he killed onthe dance floor! well, not literally.</UTT>Yeah he must have since he won lol</UTT>Then he went on to movie stardom as a martial artist. so, do you like basketball?</UTT>Somewhat.  I like watching it sometimes.  Also, did you know professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week?</UTT>If i were dancing ballet, it would be a dozen pairs a week.</UTT>lol wow that good huh</UTT>Yeah, i am a great dancer. ballet is my specialty. Just like tupac.</UTT>Yeah I hear he used to dance in high school</UTT>Yes, he was a ballet boy. he has grace and style. He was the king of mice.</UTT>Was he?  I thought he was in the nutcracker?</UTT>Yes, he was the mouse king in the nutcracker. he was dope.</UTT>Oh I see,  thats cool.</UTT>He probably was a good dancer from a young age. even as a baby. i was not.</UTT>Some people have a natural talent some have to work really hard at it.  Do you like i[phone?</UTT>I dont have an iphone. i find the smart phones to be a distraction. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>Great chat,  have a good one.
t_18d68437-5456-486b-b949-57ef2829fc72</CONV>Hello, Do you enjoy Jazz?</UTT>Hi! I do not have much experience with it, and I hope to rememdy that when we go to New Orleans later this year. I hear that is where it originated.</UTT>Yes, it did!! I have been there! You will love it! Lots of music and energy...It was developed from the blues and ragtime.</UTT>I guess Pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra.</UTT>Really, I didn't know they like Jazz, that's interesting! Did you know Jazz trumpeters like to wear a goatee? It gives comfort when playing. Makes sense.</UTT>I better not tell my son, or he will be trying to play my daughter's sax. Clint Eastwood is a jazz fan, and scored several films.</UTT>Yes, I heard he is a lifelong pianist! Very cool..In Harlem, in a woman's apartment for 20 years she holds Jazz concerts. Sometimes top performers stop by!</UTT>I would love to live in that neighborhood. There is a computer program that writes in musical compositions, do you know the name of it?</UTT>No what? Did you know there is a piano at the top of Britain's highest mountain? I would like to see that!</UTT>I would have loved to have been in the studio when Eddie Van Halen set the speakers on fire.</UTT>I know pretty crazy!! Like when MJ caught his hair on fire! My goodness what's with the fire? I was interested to know about the computer program you mentioned?</UTT>He was recording a solo for Beat It.</UTT>Yes, hmmm seems like MJ's songs can cause fires! lol I think it would be pretty interesting to be on Pink Floyd's houseboat called Astroria!  It's a recording studio.</UTT>It's funny the sound that using coins as guitar picks lends to a song. Queens' guitarist does that.</UTT>Yes, he likes the English sixpence.  Did you know Queen's guitarist has a PHD in astrophysics! Talented and smart.</UTT>I would love to have seen the piano made out of aluminum, it was on the Hindenburg.</UTT>Really, yes that would be interesting to see. There must be a picture somewhere?</UTT>I would think there would be. I thought the piano was an older instrument, it was invented in 1700's, not really that old.</UTT>True, I love to hike, I can't imagine climbing to the top of Britain's highest mountain and finding a piano! I wonder how it holds up in the elements? Maybe it was just there for a time?</UTT>That is insane. I want to know more about those who hiked up there, carrying it. Why did they do it?</UTT>Yes, maybe it had a fantastic sound when recording? Do you play piano? I took some lesson when I was young and sent my daughter for lessons.</UTT>I do not. Thanks for chatting with me, have a great day.</UTT>You too! Good chat!!</UTT>Thank you.
t_05df6d59-7521-4605-9fdf-b3054c0c1e02</CONV>Good morning!  What are your thoughts on Starbucks?</UTT>Overall I am a fan.  I have mixed feelings about the bathroom issue but a place that uses round tables so patrons will be interconnected, well, the bathroom thing is a given.</UTT>I think the bathroom thing goes with the spirit of neighborly.  Although I don't frequent Starbucks often I do enjoy their coffee.</UTT>The coffee is excellent.  Too expensive as are the food stuffs.  The bathroom thing, well, I can tell you it's problematic just as at the public libraries.</UTT>Agreed.  However, I'm not sure I would swear off Starbucks altogether as one gentleman did.  Seems a bit harsh.</UTT>It depends on your experience.  What we really need is to have a place for the homeless to clean up and go during the day.  The shelters kick them out in the mornings.  So, there they are needing bathrooms, and in the winter, places to get out of the cold.</UTT>Yes, in a neighboring town they are raising funds to build tiny homes for homeless to live in.  They wont have electric or running water, but they will have shelter.  It is a step in the right direction.</UTT>I agree.  In the public libraries the bathrooms have signs posted about drug use.  There are homeless sleeping in all the good chairs.  It's very distressing.</UTT>Ugh that wouldn't be ideal for inviting families and community members in.   Let's change gears a bit... Horror movies.  Yes?  No?</UTT>I love a good horror movie!  Not the gory ones though.</UTT>I have never been a fan.  I like suspense ok but horror NO.  And for sure not bloody gory ones.  I did find it interesting watching them can burn more than 180 calories.  I might start liking them a bit more.</UTT>That is good news about the calories.  My favorite is "The Other".  It's an older movie.  I like to stream them from YouTube or HULU.</UTT>What is it about??  Sounds interesting.  I remember watching Children of the Corn as a child and not sleeping all night.</UTT>It's about evil children. For example the mother is murdered by a child.  I can't tell you more without giving it away.</UTT>OOHHH  I have HULU so I might start watching it.  Might not finish it, but I'll start.  LOL</UTT>I'm not certain you'll find it on HULU maybe YouTube.  I've been trying to find the Children of the Corn, the original for a while now.  Maybe I should search Reddit?</UTT>Yes!  I am not an active user of Reddit, but have a few times.  They sure do have a bunch of visits, 542 million a month.</UTT>Yeah, I have not seen much on there the few times I have visited to enthrall me.</UTT>Yes, I can see that.  I'm not sure I understand the voting process.  They are just saying if they like or not with the hope of getting on their home page.</UTT>I didn't know that.  I have been strictly a search and run on Reddit.</UTT>Yes very interesting.  Not sure what the draw is but as many use it.</UTT>M either.  Younger folks are fans.  Nice chatting with you.
t_a0539ecf-f45f-4a8e-b7b9-c6757dbe3ab6</CONV>Hi! Are you a fan of college sports? I remember from that movie, Rudy, that Villanova University has a really intense football team and culture surrounding it.</UTT>well I like professional stuff more personally, likeI think its funny the dunk was banned in the NBA for a while</UTT>I know! That's because Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (remember him from 'Airpline!'?) "abused" his ability to perform it. Kind of seems unfair to ban something because someone is too good at it</UTT>ya I agree, at least they reversed the ban after a decade though</UTT>I think it was more than a decade. Someone should've sued and taken it to Supreme Court...where they have their own basketball court, "the highest court in the land!"</UTT>ya I would love to see one of those games, what about new zealands team being nicknamed the "tall blacks" that seems kind of like a bad name</UTT>I know. I wonder/hope if it might be based on their uniforms or something not related to race. Either way, it's just as bad as the Red Skins here :(</UTT>haha thats a good point, also weird is in almost 40 states the highest paid gov employee is either a football or basketball coach</UTT>That kind of makes sense, though. College teams bring in a lot of revenue for the state schools so it's a good investment to have a great coach</UTT>ya I guess if it pays for itself, do you like dramatic movies and TV?</UTT>I love dramas! I was always a big fan of Jim Carrey when he did comedy but loved him even more when he started doing dramas. It's sad that he doesn't act in dramas anymore as a policy</UTT>ya I agree, I can't imagine making 700k per episode like Hugh Laurie, I would never stop making the show House!</UTT>That's as good a reason as any to be an actor. Better than Michael Caine's origin story, which is that the prettiest girls at his school were in drama classes so he signed up, too</UTT>haha good point, I do like that Jon Hamm used to be a drama instructor for a high school, that was nice of him</UTT>I'm sure he got paid for it, like it was his career. We all have to make a living before our big breaks!</UTT>ya I agree, and at least he got to teach the actress who played Erin from the show the Office</UTT>Ugh I loved that show. I even kind of liked season 9, though I know that's not a popular opinion.</UTT>haha its all good, but I'm sure season 9 is better than the webiste with thousands of hours of free radio dramas, I bet those ar bad</UTT>Oh, is that a thing? I would love to listen to those. They're probably outdated but I'm down to try another medium of entertainment</UTT>ya I don't know I'll give it a try I guess, it is free after all</UTT>Exactly. If they put on free Greek dramas in the park, I'd go see those two. I studied Classics in college and love Greek tragedies and comedies.</UTT>ah so that might be up your alley, but ya I agree with Jim carrey it is important to support positivity in todays society with comedies
t_ddeba37e-8b17-4d37-bfe3-addb2c7220c2</CONV>Hi there! Do you enjoy basketball?</UTT>I love it! especially the NBA. How about you?</UTT>I am not a huge fan, but I can appreciate it. I tend to like college basketball better, for whatever reason. Did you know Tim Duncan played 4 years of college ball instead of going straight into the NBA?</UTT>That man is very humble because of it! I would have been like Allen Iverson and gotten a lifetime endorsement from Reebok though lol.</UTT>It seems like a lot of money to pay someone who had a relatively short career, but I think his brand has value overseas. In fact, the even though Air Jordans were initially banned by the NBA, the brand was valuable enough to Nike for them to pay Michael Jordan's fines for wearing them.</UTT>And now look at the brand! Everybody is basically wearing it these days huh?</UTT>Yes, I guess there's some nostalgia for it these days when the NBA isn't quite as interesting as it used to be. I mean, the Warriors are so dominant with Steph Curry!</UTT>I agree with you on that one! Steph Curry is an all around good guy. He donates mosquito nets to families in Africa.</UTT>That's nice of him, I guess, but he could probably do a lot more, considering his team earned $12 million by losing game 4 of the Finals last season.</UTT>You would think it was the opposite? Oh well money is money. In the last 20 years, only 3 number one picks have won the championship, do you know who they were?</UTT>I know LeBron is one of them, although he's no longer with the team he won with.</UTT>That's correct! The other two were Andrew Bogut and Kyrie Irving!</UTT>I do not know so much about them. I do know that Steph Curry's brother actually played with his Warriors teammate's brother on the Santa Cruz Warrior. I guess the basketball world is pretty small!</UTT>I bet it is! I think the real money is in drama acting though!</UTT>Theatrical drama certainly is on another level. Hugh Laurie, for example, made $700k per episode of House, the highest ever for TV drama.</UTT>I think I would be up there if I took the drama class with Jon Hamm haha.</UTT>Especially if you ended up being a comic actor like</UTT>I agree! Jim Carrey doesn't do dramas anymore because it doesn't project positivity. I would do good at comedy then haha.</UTT>Like Ellie Kemper, I meant. Jim Carrey's last project, Kidding, was certainly very dark for a comedy if he won't do drama; maybe he just means he doesn't do tragedy, which is the other half of drama in contrast to comedy,</UTT>Oh that's right I forgot about her! You know I'd only do drama class if the pretty girls were in it like Michael Caine did!</UTT>That sounds like a way to create drama in one's own life haha. It's been nice chatting!
t_51d11995-006f-4338-a634-510193d659cc</CONV>Such a shame to hear of the college players suicide.</UTT>Very sad!!! Way too young!</UTT>Any idea of why he may have done it?</UTT>He did have substance abuse issues....</UTT>Leaf and Bledsoe also showed their support for him and his family too</UTT>Yes, It struck so many with sadness and confusion.</UTT>Leaf had also attempted suicide too and can certainly relate to  what the young man was going through at the time.</UTT>Yes I heard that too. I think many can relate, sadly. He did leave a suicide note and I don't know what that stated. Do you?</UTT>No. Bledsoe reiterated the importance of reaching out to someone when you are going through tough times</UTT>Exactly, many stated reaching out is a sign of not weakness but strength. Too sad that so many feel there is no hope.</UTT>Suicide still ranks second as the cause of death for many young men aged 18 and up.</UTT>That's horrible. So much tragedy. We are on this earth for only a moment in time it seems.</UTT>His teammates were able to bounce back and do fairly well in the Holiday Bowl against Michigan, though they ended up losing sadly</UTT>I read that too. He completed 130 of 179 passes for 1,176 yards and 7 touchdowns.</UTT>I would have loved to see them beat Michigan for sure.</UTT>Me too! Hilinski was a great quarterback!</UTT>Who is your favorite NFL QB?</UTT>I really couldn't name only 1 haha who is yours?</UTT>Drew Brees and Tom Brady for sure</UTT>Oh yeah, great choices! Tom Brady is insanely talented.</UTT>I hope he doesn't retire. He actually sat the bench in high school

I wonder if they have their own version of O-.</UTT>lol maybe.  I havent really looked into it.  Did you know dogs can understand up to a thousand words?</UTT>I did know that. We should teach them more than just simple comands like sit and paw.</UTT>My friends dogs know like 50 commands!  Even the command dance!  lol</UTT>Dogs drink with underside of their tongue!</UTT>Yeah thats weird lol it looks weird too.</UTT>I am confused how dogs in moscow use the subway.</UTT>Same here,  That is really impressive though,  but im not sure how they know which subway to take lol</UTT>I also do not know why they would need to use the subway.</UTT>Probably because its faster to get around on.  Oh and where do they keep their subway ticket?  Or do dogs ride free?</UTT>Great question. I love that they experience eureka moments.</UTT>Yeah I never knew that,  thats pretty awesome.  Do you have a dog?</UTT>I do not have a dog. Do you?</UTT>I do,  shes 2,  a rescue.  I think my dog is the exception when they say dogs an elephants can understand pointing lol shes obivious.</UTT>Thats funny. Do you consider dogs to be man's best friend.</UTT>Absolutely!  My dog is always there for me.  I just wish she would laugh at some of my jokes,  that would be amazing if dogs could laugh,  thats the only thing missing lol</UTT>That is amazing.</UTT>Been great talking to you.
t_02b77cb9-bfe3-4ca1-94af-f591e2eaa72a</CONV>Hello there, are you a fan of fantasy sports?</UTT>Hi, how are you? I don't really know much about them.</UTT>I am well thank you.  I like to play, I just got into it recently though.  How about the NFL, are you a fan?</UTT>I usually follow the game right around playoff time.I'm surprised that there's only on left-handed QB in the NFL.</UTT>Yeah isn't that crazy! I would never of thought it would be that little.</UTT>One QB even threw a TD to himself! Superbowl winning quarterback, brad johnson, is the only quarterback in nfl history to throw a touchdown pass... to himself.</UTT>That is amazing, did you know the huddle was created by a deaf quarterback?</UTT>It's such a fundamental part of the game. I guess the players need to all see the QB when he's deaf and signing.</UTT>Yeah such a cool fact though.  Do you think Tom Brady is the best QB of all time?</UTT>He's got a great coach and some good receivers to help him. I do think that he's quite talented. I'm surprised that only two African-American quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl.</UTT>Yeah I think he is an average QB that plays for a way above average program.</UTT>People think the QB is the most important position but too many other people are working too hard on the field for the QB alone to get the victory.</UTT>Yeah always a team sport, but on offense the QB does run the show and always will.</UTT>On the field, it's the QB. But my understanding is that the coach calls the plays. They rely on each other in that way. I don't know whether Belichik would win without Brady, but the same thing hold for Brady without Belichik.</UTT>I think Belichik could win without Brady but not the other way around, but who knows.</UTT>Hm. That's fair. I don't know how many seasons Brady has left in him. Belichik probably could stay in the game another decade with the record that he has.</UTT>Yeah I would have to agree with you on both.  We will see how many more Tom has, I'm assuming at least 2 more.</UTT>His wife makes more than he does, so he won't have to worry about money right after he retires. I wonder if he would become a QB coach.</UTT>Yeah he could definitely retire right now and be very well off and not have a worry about money.</UTT>Well, I enjoyed chatting with you about Tom Brady! Only seven months until the season starts!</UTT>Yeah same here, I hope you have a nice day.

That's pretty mind boggling too.  So they are pretty much tracking cell phones and using some of the data for that.  Interesting.</UTT>Well said. Did you know that if you wanted, say, to find a location in the disputed region of Kashmir, Google would show you only the map of the claims of the country (India or Pakistan) where the browser you're using is located?</UTT>I didn't know that before but now I do!  Thanks!  Do you remember when Google went down for about 5 minutes on Aug. 16th 2013 and took 40 percent of the web traffic with it?  I don't remember it.</UTT>Me, either, but I do know that internet companies like Google, or Amazon, use tech that is often beyond my comprehension...Do you suppose that's the point, really?</UTT>It might be.  I'm a big Amazon customer.  Are you?</UTT>In the past few years, have ordered books and supplies from Amazon, yes. They have - almost anything, don't they?</UTT>Yes.  I have Prime and we got rid of the cable because the video streaming service for Prime is worth the price of Prime every year.</UTT>Heard that streaming is great, and that Amazon is producing original fillms and TV shows. My fav. is The Grand Tour.</UTT>My kids like the Grand Tour.  Amazon now will even deliver your packages on Sundays because they have a contract with the US post office for the delivery service.</UTT>Convenient, too. If we lived in China, the giant e-commerce co. would be Alibaba. Did you know its founder was turned down by Harvard & Yale as an under-grad. student? Think they're sorry, now?</UTT>I didn't know that!  I bet they are.  Jeff Bezos has made so much money off of Amazon that he built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years!</UTT>Far out - in time, that is. Brilliant guy, though. Has vision. Even named a building on Amazon's Seattle campus after his 1st Amazon customer! Why not?</UTT>That is neat!  IMDB is also owned by Amazon since 1998.</UTT>Yes. Whether it's Amazon (big, powerful warriors) or Alibaba (magical) the AI these giants employ is beyond me. How about you?</UTT>AI scares me.  lol  I don't trust it.  It's been a good chat.</UTT>Enjoyed your comments, thanks. Cheers!</UTT>Have a good day!  Thanks as well!
t_709dc8ca-b1e8-4799-be5f-1803effda9a4</CONV>Hello, what is you favorite NFL team></UTT>The New England Patriots, have you ever heard of Rob Gronkowski?</UTT>Mine is also the New England Patriots. I have heard of him, wasn't his brother called to complain about the Patriots recievers?</UTT>Haha yes he did. I think that's really awkward, I can't believe Chris Gronkowski actually brought that up on the radio LOL</UTT>Haha. Speaking of radios, did you know that canadian radios must play at least 40% canadian music?</UTT>No I didn't know that. I also want to know how to create a foxhole radio, they would make them in World War II, have you heard about these?</UTT>I did not. Interesting. A finnish radio station in 1989 conducted a news program entirely in classical latin. I wonder how many people could understand that!</UTT>Yeah I don't know why they would do that in Finland haha. What do you think about the website that has thousands of classic radio dramas you can listen to online? Have you tried that</UTT>I have not although I should try that out. The author of game of thrones called the new england patriots the lannisters of the NFL. I wonder why</UTT>Well if you've ever seen the show, you would know that the Lannisters are the bad guys so I take it he does not like the Patriots LOL</UTT>I agree. The Patriots's headquarters is at Gillette Stadium. The names of these stadiums clearly need work!</UTT>Yep I agree, I miss the days before corporate sponsors ruined all of the stadium names LOL. I never knew that the Patriots were in the AFC Conference though</UTT>Yep. The Buffalo Bills are equal to the Patriots when it comes to super bowl losses.</UTT>That is funny but also sad. Did you know that the NFL actually does not have a policy against female players though</UTT>Really? I guess no feminists can complain there! The average NFL game only has 11 minutes of live action. I wonder why it is cherished by so many!</UTT>Yeah I wondered about that too. I personally think that football is really boring haha. Did you know that an engineer will make more over their lifetime than a NFL player</UTT>Furthermore, a professional bowler could earn twice the amount that an NFL player does back in the 1980s!</UTT>I think it was the sixties but that's still impressive! Why do you think that cheerleaders can't eat in the same restaurant as players though? That makes me mad</UTT>I agree, because I am assuming that the cheerleaders will not cause a lot of ruckus compared to the NFL players!</UTT>Haha maybe right about that. I'm just shocked that they put tracking chips on the players on the field, I don't know how it would help to know how fast a ball is rotating LOL</UTT>I guess it tracks how much the players run in a game or something. I wonder how they got the chip inside the football to track its velocity!</UTT>That's a good point! I wonder if it affects how balls are thrown actually
t_d847c114-fc9f-4a70-9200-3797c8fa3586</CONV>How's it going, did you know a Prime Minister is the head of cabinet and leader of ministers in the executive branch?</UTT>i have heard that. canada has a prime minister. so does japan. so does the uk.</UTT>Yea, Australia does too but their Prime Minister position isn't in the constitution and is done through custom</UTT>that is interesting. i guess they decided to use the british system. i wonder how many countries have a PM. it seems to be a good system.</UTT>Quite a few. The cool thing about the UK's PM is that their cat has the government title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office</UTT>that is an excellent position. that privileges pussy is certainly lucky to have gotten that job!</UTT>Speaking of pussy did you know in 1995 Queen Elizabeth II was successfully pranked called by a radio station?</UTT>that is great! i bet it was those pesky canadians. they like to prank royalty. i am surprised that the queen did not suspect something.</UTT>Probably not, I wonder how the station got her number, maybe Helena Bonham Carter gave it to them since she is a descendant of PM Herbert Asquith</UTT>oh, those canadians are so cunning! i bet they talked their way right to the queen. they probably used silly accents. I like HBC. she seems like royalty.</UTT>I like Japan's PM, he sends out silver cups to Japanese citizens when they turn 100</UTT>that is a wonderful tradition, but with the ageing population in Japan, it bet they will be giving out a ton every year.</UTT>Yea, Japanese people tend to live longer, Japan will have to make cheaper cups, maybe use bronze</UTT>bronze, yes, something more affordable but still classy. Or raise the threshold to 200 years old.</UTT>200 years old should be a platinum cup</UTT>yes, and i think it is not impossible. with health care and stem cell therapy, people will live much longer. think of the facebook pages. 200 years old. wow.</UTT>I don't think I'd like seeing 200 years old posting photos on facebook, it's bad enough they let 13 year olds on</UTT>Yes, they could raise the minimum age. that would help protect kids. Facebook really has grown, though i hear the kids are leaving it for other sites.</UTT>I guess that's a good thing, maybe they are unfriended people to get a free whopper from Burger King</UTT>I would have made friends just to unfriend them for greasy calories. i have no shame. anyway, great chat!</UTT>You too, have a good one
t_d2253a78-ef19-4944-a172-cb0e1bf4a15b</CONV>I wonder if you would consider eating healthy as being sometimes in your perfect day?</UTT>I would think so!  Playwright-director Aaron Posner pondered the same question.</UTT>I feel my perfect day would be a little more indulgent.  I can eat healthy any time, a perfect day for me might involve alcohol and calories.</UTT>I agree.  Have you seen the movie Incredibles 2?</UTT>Just recently, we streamed in on Netflix a couple of weekends back.</UTT>I can't believe the first one came out in 2004.  Time is flying.</UTT>I know, I feel like that with so many things.  It still holds up well, though.  The second one is just as good.</UTT>There was technically a sequel to the first movie that came out in the form of a video game called "The Incredibles: The Rise of the Underminer"</UTT>Movies and video games are getting closer and closer, soon it will be just the one thing.  I'm amazed at the games my son plays on his console, way better than Pong!</UTT>Pong!  I remember that!  I think I was 7 or 8 when that came out.  The first Nintendo systems was capable of displaying only 54 colors.</UTT>My son plays that Xbox console, it's amazing how realistic that looks.</UTT>I know what you mean.  In Sept. of 2003 the Nintendo system was discontinued in Japan.</UTT>I thought it was sill around.  It's a whole lot better than watching chickens for fun like the Brits used to do in the times of Caesar!</UTT>LOL I agree!  Do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?</UTT>A little, my kids are into him now.  I think he's good, the way he gets kids interested in science.</UTT>Yes.  He got his big break by winning a Steve Martin lookalike contest!</UTT>I can ind of see that.  Steve Martin is very entertaining, I used to enjoy his comedy movies.</UTT>Yes.  I love his movies.  Do you like comedies then?</UTT>Depends on my mood.  After a long hard day I really like to relax with a comedy.</UTT>I like them too.  I didn't realize Comedy Central has been around since 1989.</UTT>Again time flies, just like with the original Incredibles move.  Also, just like this conversation.  Goodbye.
t_a488e1c3-d0c2-499d-a4af-a4741fc70bdb</CONV>Hello,  does poetry and books interest you?</UTT>Hello! I love poetry. Interesting that David GRUBBS HAS DONE SO MUCH!</UTT>Thats awesome.  Yes,  I actually have never heard of David Grubbs until today.  very interesting.  What kind of poetry interest you?  i just read There is a poem when read normally is depressing, but when read backwards is inspiring.</UTT>I have always loved poetry especially Robert frost. That's so interesting!</UTT>also interesting is that Almost all of the hobbit's character names were taken out of an old icelandic poem "dvergatal".  Ive always loved those movies and book!</UTT>Yes! me too! Did you know Edgar allan poe only recieved $9 for his poem The Raven? That is insane, I like his poetry too.</UTT>What!  Thats ridiculous.  Yeah,  his poetry is good.  I really like dr. suess!</UTT>Dr Suess is my favorite!! Love everything about those books!</UTT>Those green eggs and ham really make you think,  right! haha</UTT>Haha! Right? I share the same birthday with him lol...not the year though. Do you have any favorite Albums? I love Pink Floyd forever lol</UTT>I really love Bryce Vines album and maybe the old TLC album.</UTT>Great Albums! I loved the concert I went to a few years back to see Aerosmith, I can't believe they are still going strong. But I love all genre's of music.</UTT>ooooh Aerosmith,  I loved one of their albums too.  I can totally believe they are going strong,  they have so many hits!  And so many fans that will support them.</UTT>Definitely! I remember when I first heard them, I have been a fan for many years. I saw Pink Floyd too in concert it's hard to believe 40 years ago they released The Dark Side of the Moon.</UTT>Wow,  hard to believe how time flies.  I dont really keep up with music or go to concerts.  Anytime I hear a song on pandora I just download it.  You are obviously a pink floyd fan,  how many of their concerts have you been to?</UTT>I don't go to concerts much anymore but throughout my life I have seen all of my favorite bands. Yes Pink Floyd is a favorite but their concerts were hard to get tickets for so I only went one time but happy I did. I love my music!</UTT>Thats greatDid you know Linkin park's "hybrid theory" is the best-selling album of the 21st century.  Really sad about Chester Bennington.</UTT>I love and have followed Linkin Park for years I love them and it was very very sad about Chester. I think we lost a great person. I didn't get the chance to see one of their concerts and now I never will.</UTT>Yeah,  definitely one of my regrets also.  His voice is so unique and the band is amazingly talented.  Really good music.  I suppose a lot of musicians suffer from some kind of ailment.</UTT>We have definitely lost a lot of the great musicians and many suffer from Depression. I will always be a fan. A month before Chris Cornell passed too and that was very sad, I loved his music as well. Have some of his albums on Cd.</UTT>What band is Chris Cornell from?</UTT>He was in Soundgarden....Audioslave....Temple of The Dog</UTT>oh I remember Soundgarden.  I remember that I disliked that song black hole sun.  Maybe I just never really got it though haha</UTT>HAHAHA, I know some of the songs have a lot of secret meanings. He had a great voice though. He sang with Eddie Vedder in Hunger strike album.</UTT>Nice!  Yeah,  im really slow to figure what songs are about.  Like that song pumped up kicks,  its so catchy,  and then I listened to the words and its sad.</UTT>I know what you mean, but I write poetry but self taught non published...just do it to get my thoughts out...and I turned one into a song that a local band here in town recorded it and sing it at their shows, pretty cool lol. And pumped up kicks is very sad! Love the tune though.</UTT>Wow thats awesome!  congradulations!</UTT>Thanks!</UTT>What band is it and what type of music ?</UTT>It is a small gig band and they never made it big or anything. There name is Oral Groove and it was a song about losing the love of your life .....a soft rock song....called Forever After.</UTT>Cool,  did they make a youtube video on it?  That would be cool to hear.</UTT>Oh, No I don't think so this was back in the early 90s so I don't think Youtube was around then. I am not even sure they are still playing or not.</UTT>Oh haha.  Yeah im pretty sure youtube wasnt around then.</UTT>I wish! I am sure there would be some good videos from that time. I have the professional recorded cassette of the song lo,   cassette! hahaha</UTT>Omg....whats a cassette???  lol jk.  Thats funny because the other day I was cleaning out my ants closet and found Harry Potter on VHS,  my nephew says"  what is that?"</UTT>HAHHAAAA,Wow, vhs! That seems like a long long time ago!!!  Well I have had the best time chatting! Thank you!</UTT>Thanks,  have a good day!</UTT>You too!!</UTT>Thanks.
t_ce20027d-9b41-41aa-b616-e713b68a718c</CONV>do you like cars?</UTT>I love cars. Do you know when the drive thru was invented?</UTT>yes that was in 1975 by McDonald's</UTT>Yes and do you know why that was?</UTT>because soldiers were not allowed out of their cars in fatigues</UTT>Yes. Do you know why the trunk of the car is called that?</UTT>Yes because n the old cars there used to be wooden trunks</UTT>Yeah. Do you know how Cadillac got its name?</UTT>Yes after the founder of Detroit, de la Mothe Cadillac</UTT>Yes, Do you know how Mardenborough became a professional driver?</UTT>Yes he beat 90 00 people n gran turismo</UTT>Yeah. In South Africa you are allowed to put flame throwers in the car</UTT>Yes that is to prevent car jacking</UTT>Yeah. Do you have a favorite king of shoes?</UTT>I love runners. Did you know shoes were better 5000 years ago than now?</UTT>Yeah it seem. Ballet dancers spend a lot on shoes</UTT>Yes they use up to 4 pairs a week</UTT>Yeah. Do you know how you can keep your shoes fresh?</UTT>Yes you can actually put tea bags in them to keep them smelling fresh</UTT>Yeah. Did you know Steve SMith leaves his shoes on the field after the games?</UTT>Yes to raise awareness for the homeless without shoes</UTT>Yeah that is nice of him. Nice chat
t_629130f7-4b75-4671-ae2c-80f70fe17edd</CONV>did you know that linkin park did over 300 concerts in 2001?</UTT>I did not. That's a shockingly high amount of concerts. Are you a fan of Lou Reed speaking of music?</UTT>I can't say I know him, are you a fan of him? What band is he in?</UTT>Velvet Underground. In 2010 he and his wife held a high frequency concert for dogs. That's interesting.</UTT>ah that is interesting, I wonder how the dogs liked it? Maybe they hated it how would you know!</UTT>That's a very good question. I wonder what the owners say about how they reacted. Are you aware of ABBA?</UTT>yes I do know about ABBA, I like them, what do you think about them?</UTT>Not a big fan but they have some catchy songs. They turned down 1 billion dollars to do a 100 concert reunion tour. I wonder how they still have so much money that they could do that?</UTT>ya that is true, I do like Pink Floyd a lot, what about you? I guess they did a concert in an ancient roman amphitheater</UTT>I love Pink Floyd. I bet that was an amazing concert. In 1972 Deep Purple held the loudest concert ever and three audience members became unconscious. With all of the extremely heacy metal since I am shocked that Deep Purple holds that record.</UTT>ah yes I do like Deep Purple too, I guess when Pink Floyd did that concert they did it to an empty area, there was no audience in the amphitheater</UTT>That's a shame. I'm sure it would have been used. I wonder if they recorded and released it?</UTT>ya I would love to see that, do you like the Ramones?</UTT>I do like The Ramones.</UTT>well the ramones have performed over 2200 concerts, isn't that insane? They've been touring for 20 years now</UTT>Wow! That is shocking. I had no idea they toured that long. I don't think there's many left now unfortunately. I like the Foo Fighters also. They held a concert so loud that it showed up on seismic monitors.</UTT>haha that is crazy, also I don't like Creed what about you? apparently they did a concert that was so bad they were sued lol</UTT>I do not like them at all. I can't say I'm surprised. I don't know who their fan base is because I don't know anyone that likes them. Do you enjoy Star Wars?</UTT>I do like star wars, but I like the old ones, the new ones are pretty horrible in my opinion</UTT>Well it had a lot of influence. James Cameron quit his truck driving job to make movies after seeing it.</UTT>that is great I love James Cameron, he directed Terminator, Terminator 2, true lies, so many great movies!</UTT>Yes and Aliens which I love. He is great. George Lucas says that the Star Wars story we are seeing is told by R2D2 about a 100 years after Return of the Jedi.</UTT>well that is interesting, I think its crazy that darth vader is so iconic but all his lines were recorded for the first movie in about 3 hours</UTT>I guess he doesn't have a lot of dialogue overall. I wish the revealed man would have also been James Earl Jones.
t_dc587fd7-4fc9-44c5-b708-ac30574d52b7</CONV>Hi, how are you doing this evening?</UTT>Hi I'm doing well. Do you like baseball? I personally think it's really boring haha</UTT>Baseball is a slow game. I usually pay attention around the time of the playoffs. Then there's a lot of energy.</UTT>Yeah it gets burst of energy, and then a lot of really boring Parts LOL. I never knew that baseball managers could actually play for their team. That's why they wear uniforms, duh</UTT>Yeah, it's easier to just watch the highlight reel. The managers probably played way back in the day. Now? It would be sad. I'd want my money back.</UTT>Haha yep they would probably get injured really quickly LOL have you ever played kickball when you were a kid</UTT>I played kickball. Safer than dodgeball, that's for sure.</UTT>Yep I agree with you there. In Canada they call kickball soccer-baseball instead, it doesn't quite have the same ring LOL</UTT>It sure doesn't. That's clunky name. Baseball is so popular in Japan that many fans are surprised to discover it's  america's national pastime. I wonder why? The sport started here.</UTT>I agree with you. It's very screwy that they would not realize that LOL oh, did you hear about the man who found millions of dollars of baseball cards and his grandfather's attic? Now that is living the dream haha</UTT>That would be great! I would sell some of them, but keep some for a long-term investment. You never know how much they could be worth one day.</UTT>No you're right. That's why I don't throw anything away. And it's also why my house is a mess LOL. One thing I don't understand is why the MLB used a married couple for 24 years to schedule all their games, why wouldn't they use a computer</UTT>The couple probably used some kind of technology, but I bet they had a friend at the MLB head office. Maybe they were inexpensive? I dunno.</UTT>haha ya, and they did that until 2005, very crazy!</UTT>That's a long time. Do you watch the World Series? I try to.</UTT>No I can't say that I do haha. I like I said I don't really watch sports that much. I know that it is the best-of-seven games correct? Who do you want to win this year</UTT>I like it when an underdog wins. I'm tired of big city teams with big payrolls winning. The Series should bring out the best in the fans and the players.</UTT>Yep I like that too. What's crazy is that Babe Ruth tried to steal a base in game seven. That's what made him lose the 1926 World Series. Wasn't Babe Ruth really fat?</UTT>He was pretty big later on, but he was also a pitcher at one time, so maybe he was speedy. Still, stealing a base? He was a hitter, not a runner.</UTT>Yep I agree with you. Pretty cool that the Cubs were the first team to win back-to-back World Series. I know that would be impressive</UTT>It was impressive, but then they hit the world's longest losing streak. How? Is it a curse?</UTT>Haha well at least the curse has been broken. What's also crazy is that the Women's World Cup had higher television ratings than the World Series in the United States. Personally I think soccer is even worse than baseball so I don't know how that's possible
t_d8f83b82-53cf-44c7-b1b0-6b8bb7f2ce8d</CONV>Do you enjoy classical music?</UTT>I do, I listen to classical music when Im working what about you?</UTT>I enjoy listening to classical music in a serene space, but did you know classical music concerts originally had loud wild audiences?</UTT>I didnt thats a cool fact, another cool fact is that a computer composed a classical music master piece back in 2011</UTT>I wonder if it was any good? In any case, classical music isn't just music. Cities are using it to successfully deter crime in public space with remarkable results</UTT>They are? that application is suprising and new to me have you attended any good concerts lately?</UTT>I recently attended Joe Hisaishi's concert. He has amazing melodies and it would be perfect music to listen to in a beautifully scenic place in nature</UTT>I haven heard of that artist I might look him up in Youtube later today, there is a roman amphitheatre in Cratia that its still used for concerts, it would be amazing to attend a concert there</UTT>did you know creed concerts entered into 4 lawsuits, I think I would be fine</UTT>Thats too bad Creed used to be a great band, do you like Linking Park?</UTT>They are pretty good and they even had 300+ concerts in 2001 alone due to their sucess</UTT>Thats a lot of concerts for a year, I loved their first album it was a success indeed.</UTT>Speaking of concerts have you ever listened to the ramones? They played a total of 2000 concerts and toured for nearly 20 years</UTT>I have too bad I didnt make it to any of their concerts, they are a really talented group.</UTT>I agree. Personally I am a fan of the piano for most songs</UTT>Piano is a great instrument I really like it, it has such a relaxing tone, in the 30s the BBC network decided to broadcast piano music instead of the news</UTT>Did you know a group of climber reach britain's highest mountain peak and found a piano. Someone must really like the piano</UTT>I agree I would be too busy getting freezed to play the piano, that must require a lot of hard physical work though.</UTT>I sure respect Bartolomeo for inventing such a beautiful instrument so far back in the 1700s.</UTT>Wow that was 300 years ago! the piano is an old instrument, there is also an aluminum grand piano</UTT>I didn't know that. In any case thank you for the chat. I am going to look up what the aluminum grand piano looks like after this chat.

I only know that cause that is my birthday lol</UTT>I see.  They have offices in the US and international locations but their headquarters are located in New York.</UTT>Yeah its pretty crazy the players are the worlds best paid athletes by annual salary per year</UTT>Some of them are also endorsed by big corporations..extra money in their pocket.  Apparently, Allen Iverson is paid $800K per year by Reebok and he will get a final lump sum payment of $32 M when he reaches age 55.</UTT>Yeah that is interesting.. it pays well but basketball has been around for quite awhile... 39 out of 50 states highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach</UTT>That was interesting to know.  Apparently, air jordan shoes were banned upon introduction by the NBA.</UTT>Really that is nuts... Kareem abdul-jabbars domainat use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball over a decade ago</UTT>NBA did not like his dominant use of the dunk.</UTT>yeah i know</UTT>About the air jordan shoes, Jordan kept wearing them and Nike did not mind paying penalties since the shoes became very popular and profitable to the company.</UTT>yeah that is pretty nuts but its a great way for nike to advertise</UTT>That was their purpose, I think.  Apparently, Tim Duncan decided to finish college before joining the NBA.</UTT>yeah that was a smart i idea he was preparing for the future not just getting the money then</UTT>I would do it differently though because the offer might not come four years later.</UTT>that is true he could of tried to do both</UTT>NBA players refuse to do granny style shooting even though it can be beneficial to score points.</UTT>yeah they would look kind of funny doing that in the middle of a game... thats how i shoot lol I am more of nerd than an athlete lol</UTT>You are funny.  They said they did not want to look stupid.</UTT>yeah lol so do you think pluto is still a planet</UTT>I personally think so.  But the scientific community does not think so.  Anyway, I've go to run.  Nice chatting with you.

Kareem abdul-jabbar's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade.</UTT>Hello! I am a fan of Basketball and find it funny they have a basketball court on the top floor of the supreme court building!</UTT>Yeah right!  Also this is really interesting too.  Colleges get a lot of money for basketball. In 39 out of 50 states, the highest paid state employee is either a college football or basketball coach.</UTT>That is interesting! The NBA players are the highest paid athletes in the world!</UTT>Thats not too surprising.  James naismith, the inventor of basketball, is the only losing coach in the university of kansas's history</UTT>Wow, that sucks lol, did you know Reggie Miller scored a career high 40 points in High School! Nuts!</UTT>Yeah I just read that lol he tried bragging about it on the car ride home, only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records!</UTT>Right! That was too funny, and she had an amazing record for sure! I heard NBA players think it looks stuoid to shoot granny style but it has been proven it is the best technique to score points! That is crazy, who cares what you look like lol....</UTT>I know right,  get the points,  you dont have to look cool lol</UTT>Exactly! That should be the only goal lol</UTT>Nba player allen iverson signed a lifetime endorsement contract with reebok in 2001 that would pay him $800,000 a year until he reaches age 55 to where he would then receive a final lump sum payment of $32,000,000.</UTT>That is a crazy amount of money! I can't imagine having that much money for advertising for Reebok!</UTT>I know right!  Air jordan's were banned upon introduction by the nba. however, jordan wore them anyways, as nike was willing to pay the fine each game.</UTT>I heard about that! And look how big Air Jordans became, I am sure they were happy to pay the fine lol</UTT>Im sure.  Advertising!  lol</UTT>Exactly! Money money! Tim Duncan gave up money to stay in college for 4 years instead of going straight to the NBA....</UTT>He was playing basketball since I was in high school!  lol I think he just retired last year or something</UTT>Wow, he's pretty fortunate to be retired and be set for life!</UTT>Yeah seriously.  Did you know New york's area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone</UTT>Really? LOL, rotary dial phones were awful, I wonder if theres anyone that still has one lol</UTT>Geez I hope not! lol its been fun  have a good one
t_5414b24a-8ace-4af6-a12e-880d8d7212a5</CONV>Hi, how are you today? Do you like to listen to music?</UTT>I love music!</UTT>I do too. I think that music is the international language, one that transcends borders and cultures.</UTT>There is a music festival in DC about the color purple. It has jazz and ragtime music. Do you like either of those?</UTT>I do like jazz. It is truly America's greatest musical contribution to the music world.</UTT>I like it too. Did you know it originates for African American Communities?</UTT>I am not surprised. Many of the greatest musical innovation in the US came from the black communities that were marginalized and oppressed. Now the world loves this music.</UTT>I think that's great! What a great stride America has made in acceptance. Jazz is characterized by it's swing and blue notes. Ragtime is my favorite.</UTT>You like ragtime, It is quite old, but it is quite catchy. I do not usually listen to it.</UTT>Ragtime is just a sub category of Jazz. Have you ever listened to Ella Fitzgerald?</UTT>Yes, I have. She has an angelic voice. Pure. She was the best scat artist out there.</UTT>She was! She actually taught herself to sing 2 notes at once like mongolian singers.</UTT>That is a very cool talent. I wonder how long it took her to learn that skill.</UTT>That is a good question! I know she learned how to by the time she was 18, but that is all.</UTT>She was very gifted. I wish that I had seen her in concert. I do have a couple of her albums though.</UTT>I wish I did! Did you ever see the series Breaking Bad?</UTT>Yes, I did. It was a great show. I don't remember the music. Was Ella in that somewhere?</UTT>She was not, but a Jazz musician by the name of Walter White wrote an album called Breaking Good!</UTT>LOL That's great! A great play on words. Anyway, great chat!</UTT>You too! Thank you!</UTT>Have a great day!</UTT>You too!
t_63474d9a-f564-4661-bddc-6543b4d11e9f</CONV>Good Morning! Have you been to any concerts lately?</UTT>No, in fact I don't quite remember my last concert. Like the Ramone who probably don't remember their first concerts, they have been touring for 20 years.</UTT>Oh wow that's been awhile. They've played over 2263 concerts.</UTT>I must be horrible for family life, but I don't think family life is in the value of the Ramones.</UTT>haha I'm sure it's not. They could be as bad as Creed though and get sued for putting on a bad concert.</UTT>I don't think they would have continued touring if there were continually sued for putting bad shows. I wonder how bad the concert was.</UTT>It must have been really bad. Did you know that when Obama went to India, they removed all coconuts in the surrounding area.</UTT>Why would they do that ?</UTT>So one wouldn't fall on him I'm guessing haha.</UTT>That would be dangerous, I always have difficulties to open them when I buy them at the grocery store.</UTT>Yes I avoid them because of that difficulty. Speaking of presidents, the three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.</UTT>Which one surprises you the most ? Me, it is Washington.</UTT>Me too, but I'm sure he was a businessman before being the General he was.</UTT>But, he could have lost a lot if thing did not go his way. I think that makes him even more a hero.</UTT>I agree. I wonder if he's the one that made the guest house bigger at the White House than the White House itself?</UTT>Did Washington build the white house ?</UTT>I think he helped design it maybe?</UTT>Yeah, probably, and must have a thought about a guest house, since there were not much hotels in Washington at the time.</UTT>Oh I agree, Did you know the president of Indonesia has realesed 3 pop albums?</UTT>This means that the first one was "good" enough to warrant the publication of 2 others. That is surprising.</UTT>have a good day!
t_23497de6-8225-4945-a893-dfc4b1fdfe44</CONV>Hi, how are you? Do you like soccer?</UTT>I love soccer, its one of my passions, did you watch the FIFA World Cup last year?</UTT>I watched very little. Once the US didn't qualify, I lost interest.</UTT>Too bad the US didnt make it, its the first in many years, soccer is a sport that makes a lot of money, more than the most popular combined.</UTT>Yeah. It just shows the international appeal of soccer.</UTT>It is, Im excited about the 2022 World Cup too bad its going to be in Qatar, too expensive to go there</UTT>Yeah. It's going to be hot there too! I saw last summer some days were at 120! Why choose there?</UTT>Im guessing its because of all the money, hopefully the us can repeat the role of 1930 and place third or above</UTT>I just want them to qualify! I found it interesting that there are no economic advantages to host the cup games.</UTT>I can see the logic behind that, Brazil did suffer a lot during the construction of their stadiums during the 2014 World Cup.</UTT>Didn't they have a bunch of construction workers die during construction of the stadiums? Seems like a waste...</UTT>Im not aware of that but it wouldnt surprise me, the US womans soccer team are a pretty good team they always place 3rd or above in the World Cup</UTT>I would take that for the men! Do you think it has anything to do with the international oppression of women's rights?</UTT>Yeah and the lack of support of other countries, usually they just focus on the mens team, so do you also like football?</UTT>I do like football. Do you</UTT>I like it as well, did you know bowlers used to earn more than football players back in the 60s</UTT>really???? Who is your favorite team? Mine is the bears...</UTT>Mine are the Patriots, Im really excited about the Superbowl this year.</UTT>And you should be! You got plans for the game?</UTT>Yeah I have plans, Im going to watch it with family what about you? what team will you cheer for</UTT>I think the pats and I watch it alone. I just don't want the questions from non-NFL fans.... Nice chatting with you!
t_7d7b22ea-39aa-4f72-b649-c6867286761f</CONV>Hello how are you doing?  Do you like Drama?  I just read that Hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama, earning $700,000 per episode in House.</UTT>Im good. I do like drama. wow that is a lot of money per episode. That show is really good</UTT>i actually haven't seen it,  but its an interesting fact!</UTT>Did you know that atrick stewart teaches master classes for drama students in the uk.</UTT>Thats awesome!  I would take his class if I was into acting.  Jim carrey doesn't make dramas any more because his beilef system prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity</UTT>thats why he hasn't been in any movies interesting. I never knew that The term soap opera originated from such dramas being typically sponsored by soap manufacturers in the past.</UTT>That is a cool fact.  I have always wondered but I guess never that interested to look it up lol Michael caine became an actor because all the prettiest girls at his school were in drama class.</UTT>thats funny. It definitely paid off for him. Did you know there is a movie called ikea heights shot in the ikea store in burbank Ca and the store didn't even know</UTT>Really?  Thats awesome,  No I never heard of that movie.  Their security must really be bad.</UTT>Probably. did you know that air travel is 10 percent slower now that it was in the 60's to save on fuel</UTT>That is unfortunate.  Did you know The dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to travel at 160mph.</UTT>that will help traffic alot. There's a website for people that will let you crash on their couch while you're traveling. that sounds a little scary</UTT>Yeah is it couch surfing?</UTT>I don't think I could do that it sounds sketchy. I didn't know People were stealing garden gnomes, take them traveling, and then return the gnome, with photos, back to the owner. I always thought it was their gnome</UTT>That is kinda weird.  yeah I dunno about the couch surfing either unless someone I know was with me.</UTT>I wouldn't do that alone either. I just learned this and thought it was smart.  During the age of discovery, ships released rabbits onto islands to provide a future food source for other travelers</UTT>Yeah thats interesting.  Mackinac island, mi has banned motorized vehicles for over a hundred years. most travel by horse-drawn carriages or bikes.</UTT>the stone age. High-heeled shoes were originally worn by persian cavalry soldiers, perhaps as early as the 9th century. that sounds super uncomfortable</UTT>Really?  persian soliders lol that seems weird. The first king to travel around the world was king kalakaua of hawaii</UTT>from hawaii thats interesting. the queen of england employs somebody to wear her shoes before her to ensure they are comfortable.</UTT>but they dont have the same feet how will one person know its comfortable for another person?  lol well it was good talking to you.
t_d9cd3a19-c883-490a-9e11-7f9a36860fd7</CONV>DI you shop online?</UTT>alot of the time, I like to shop on amazon and you?</UTT>me too. Have you ever shopped the Amazon Basics line?</UTT>I love it  too, I know they say it is not the best quality but I find it good enough</UTT>me too did you know jeff built a clock on a mountain somewhere?</UTT>Oh cool. Amazon holds the patent on the 1-click buying</UTT>Yes and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years. I bet they make money from the license</UTT>Yeah they do and among those who have to pay them is Apple also</UTT>Nice. Did you know their workers walk up to 15 miles a day</UTT>that is a lot. They have a website where they sell returned stuff</UTT>Nice must be good prices there. They are delivering on Sundays now through USPS</UTT>So convenient. Do you know what the arrow in their logo means?</UTT>Hmm I am not sure, what? THey also owns IMDB.</UTT>Nice. The logo means they have everything from A to Z</UTT>Oh that makes sense. They named a building after their first customer who spent less than $30</UTT>Nice. Best Buy and Target have this thing where they match their prices to Amazon</UTT>Nice deal. DO you like drama?</UTT>I like it. Do you know Jon Hamm was a drama teacher in a high school?</UTT>Hmm did now know that. DO you know how Michael Caine became an actor?</UTT>Yesh he was chasing the pretty girls who were in drama class</UTT>Haha I guess he knew what he wanted
t_75990d14-42cb-4a2d-a3ea-3999f6216aa0</CONV>Hi there!  Are you a fan of Shakespeare?</UTT>I love Shakespeare, I wish I was more into his work and knew more than a few plays, how about you?</UTT>I know a little... He is regarded as the greatest writer in the English language!</UTT>I bet, he is probably the most famous writer that everyone knows! He even evented names like Maranda, Jessica, and Olivia</UTT>I didn't know that!  He coined many phrases we still use today like "good riddance" and "wild goose chase".</UTT>lol, those are great ones! Did you know he was alive the same time as Pocahontas?</UTT>I see that.  They both only died a year apart too.</UTT>that is so crazy to think that. I figured it was hundreds of years apart. Are you into dramas?</UTT>I do like watching dramas!</UTT>Did you ever watch house?</UTT>I did!  I liked that show a lot!</UTT>Hugh Laurie made 700,000 an episode for that show!</UTT>Wow!  Big bucks!  Did you ever watch Mad Men with Joh Hamm?  He taught drama at his old high school.</UTT>I used to love that show, he definitely could teach some skills to people. I was a Michael Caine fan also</UTT>I love his story of how he got into drama...because all the pretty girls in his school were in drama.  lol</UTT>That is a great way to start lol, it paid off for him. I am sure he got all pretty girls after he became an actor lol</UTT>lol So true!  Jim Carrey doesn't make dramas any more because his belief system prevents him from playing in movies that don't project positivity.  I kind of like that system.</UTT>That is a great system he has. Positive is the best!</UTT>I agree!  Did you know that there is a website where you can listen to 1000's of classic radio drama episodes for free?  That's kind of neat.</UTT>I need to check that station out. I am curious how that is. It was so nice chatting with you!</UTT>I had a great time!  Hope you have a good night!
t_ad22b1fe-670d-4198-8b24-62ab7615db6b</CONV>Hello,  do you listen to the radio?</UTT>I used to listen to the radio when I was younger. Not so much now. How about you?</UTT>I dont listen to the radio much either,  not since pandora,  google music and spotify came out lol I just learned that there is a website that plays a lot of radio dramas for free though.</UTT>I wonder who would listen to old radio dramas. People from a generation or two ago?</UTT>lol maybe people who are on a road trip and have no signal.  It could be an old what people did before audible!  haha</UTT>I think that radio needs to update itself to be relevant for the Internet generation.</UTT>Some stations are still popular,  like the ones that have the announcers doing the sports.</UTT>I think if the content is good, people will listen. But the restrictions on access are the big problem. Easy to get on YouTube.</UTT>Apparently this is a canadian law that they have to play at least 40 percent canadian music lol</UTT>The CanCon restriction. That's where Bob and Doug MacKenzie come from.</UTT>Who are Bob and Doug Mackenzie?</UTT>They are two characters in the movie Strange Brew. They were created for Canadian TV as stereotypical Canadians with thick accents.</UTT>I see. Is that a TV show you like?</UTT>They're kinda funny. Not really my favorites. Are you a sports fan?</UTT>I like baseball and hockey.  I do not watch it often though. Do you like sports?</UTT>I usually get interested around playoff time.</UTT>What sports interests you?  Did you know baseball managers can play in the game if needed?</UTT>I think that comes from the time when a player also acted as manager. A holdover from the early years.</UTT>I see.  That is interesting.</UTT>It probably dates from the time that the Chicago Cubs won back-to-back World Series.</UTT>Thanks for the info,  been good chatting.
t_b2e71e97-5baa-4ac5-a75b-9d9fcfe1bebf</CONV>Do you still use the radio/</UTT>I do, but only when I'm driving, what about you?</UTT>I actually don't use it at all. I do find it interesting how people apply it into space exploration. Did you know radios can pick up jupier's radio storms?</UTT>No, can you pick it up on AM or FM radio?</UTT>That I am not sure. However, I am sure it is a much more powerful radio than the foxhole radios of wwii.</UTT>Yeah, apparently they made them out of razor blades and a pencil. Amazing!</UTT>I guess radio is still alive since people are making websites where you can hear thousands of classic radio dramas for free</UTT>I've never listened to it, do you know what station it is?</UTT>I am sure you can look it up on google. What do you listen to on the radio. Do you ever hear informative broadcasts such as about earth?</UTT>No, but did you know that Jupiter saves earth from asteroids heading towards the planet?</UTT>It is because the planet gets hit instead right?</UTT>Yeah, I'm pretty sure that is what is going on. Crazy right, it must be the gravity?</UTT>And Jupiter being so big probably helps a lot too. Did you know that red dot is a forever self perpetuating storm?</UTT>Yeah, that is crazy. I watched a tv show about it a long time ago.</UTT>I sure am happy that jupiter protects earth since earth is the only known planet to harbor life.</UTT>Well did you know the earth's magnetic field reverses every 200,000-300,00 years? Wonder what that will do to everyone's gadgets?</UTT>Most people and their things probably won't last that long so it should be fine</UTT>That's true, by then technology will have advanced so much it won't matter.</UTT>Hopefully we will use that technology for the better such as replenishing the earth's natural forests, 80% which we have already destroyed</UTT>That's true. Did you know that the Earth is almost 4x as dense as the sun? I find this hard to believe.</UTT>Perhaps it is because earth is a planet, while the sun is a star? In any case, I thank you for this chat and hope you have a wonderful day.
t_61fd5c89-f68c-43c1-aa00-732dd5004f8c</CONV>Hi there! Do you like Star Wars?</UTT>Hi! I don't though I do have respect for it. It's the second highest grossing film series of all time.</UTT>Oh man, I love them! Have you seen any of them?</UTT>Hmm, I think I saw the first one a long time ago. They make a lot of money in merchandise as well.Do you have any merchandise?</UTT>Hmm, I do have a couple of t-shirt. One is a Yankee's Empire shirt with Darth Vader on it lol. I imagine others have a lot more than me</UTT>Neat! It was deemed the most successful film merchandising franchise by Guiness World Records.</UTT>I can't believe Lucas Films sold the franchise to Disney. They are going to keep pumping new movies indefinitely now.</UTT>Ah, you're right. And to think that 20th Century Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop. They agreed to George Lucas's proposal to forgo an extra $500 for directing so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. That made him a billionaire.</UTT>It's so popular in 2013, they actually dubbed it Navajo! James Earl Jones does make me thing of that new Lion King movie coming out. Looks fantastic!</UTT>Oh, James Earl Jones! I heard he spent only 2 and a half hours recording all of Darth Vadar's lines for Star Wars and was paid $7500.</UTT>Haha that must be for the original move or trilogy. I'm sure he got paid for the new three in the early 2000's. And he's definitely getting paid for Lion King.</UTT>So that's a new lion king movie that's coming back? I like anything with big cats including lion dances. The Smithsonian has an annual Chinese New Year festival with a lion dance and acrobats. I'd love to see it.</UTT>Yeah I think they cool it live action or something. Beyonce is in it lol. The Smithsonian in DC is awesome! I was there a few years ago. Have you ever been to DC?</UTT>Oh, I was expecting a cartoon! And no, I have not been to DC yet. Seems like there is a lot going on there.</UTT>I'm on the East Coast, so I've been there a few times. It's a fun city if you want to travel there. Good food and a lot to see. It's pretty there too.</UTT>The Freer Gallery of Art which has the Smithsonian's Asian art collection is having a Lunar New Year party which has opera performances and dance, and also some food samples. I'd love to go.</UTT>The Cherry Blossom's are awesome in the Spring too! Are you a big traveler at all?</UTT>Yeah I have always wanted to see the Cherry Blossoms. I love traveling but don't go as often as I like.</UTT>I do too. I've been to do as much I can recently. I'd really like to see Iceland. Apparently you have use domestic flights between major towns there!</UTT>Would you take a dutch commuter bus? It is made to travel at 160 mph.</UTT>I think I've been on speed trains in Italy that get close to that so I would. Anyway, it was great chatting with you. Have a great rest of your night.</UTT>I think I'd be scared. Have a great night!

What about you?</UTT>Comedy movie is my favourite it make stress free and happier also. The main aim of the film is to make the audience to laugh.</UTT>Comedy is great for laughs. I like the kinds that have happy endings more than black comedies.</UTT>The origin was found in Greece. Mainly stand-up comedy is very famous it held at theatre also.</UTT>I have never seen comedy in theatres, but I would like to someday. Most of the comedy I watch is on TV. I use Netflix for a lot of it.</UTT>Comedy is divided into multiple genres based on the source of humor and the method of delivery. There are different form of comedy.</UTT>I like situational comedies the best, much more than slapstick. What's your favorite kind of comedy?</UTT>Stand-up comedy is my best and the way of delivering is also very good make me laugh.</UTT>Stand-up comedy is the best kind to see done live in a theater. I think it works better that way than it does in films.</UTT>Yeah. Watching on live and make very humors also.</UTT>Do you have a favorite comedy film? My favorite is Kung Fu Hustle.</UTT>21 Jump street, hangover, Deadpool, The Dicator etc...</UTT>I loved Deadpool! It was one of the best superhero movies lately. The Hangover is funny too, one of the better bromantic comedy movies.</UTT>Laughing make free from stress and bring happier it also good for health. So only i watching it to free from worries also.</UTT>Movies are great to relieve stress and make me feel better, I agree. I sometimes even watch animated kid's comedy movies for fun because of that.</UTT>Sometime i read comic books also. Netflix is a media service provider founded in 1997 which offers online streaming of a library of films and television programs.</UTT>I use Netflix a lot. It is amazing that it has over 137 million people who subscribe to it, and I am just one of those many!</UTT>Please add I am also the next one. In US only 58.46 million subscriber for Netflix.</UTT>There are so many subscribers all over the world. It makes me want to go watch some movies on Netflix right now. I think I'll try one of the ones you suggested earlier. Thanks for chatting!

I would love to travel to Hawaii.</UTT>I guess he didn't like it there, since he left to sight seen the world ;) lol</UTT>Lol.  The dutch are creating a commuter bus designed to travel at 160mph.</UTT>160mph ? Don't they have speed limits ?</UTT>I'm not sure about that.  All of japans highways are tolls, and it costs more than 300$ to travel across the country.</UTT>yeah, I heard their currency is stronger that US$ ... damn, it's expensive to travel there... but I've heard those are all very kind people...</UTT>Oh really.  I didn't realize that.</UTT>Yes, it's something we all could learn from them. Respect to other people... culture and kindness is being taught to kids before they even start regular education in school...</UTT>Espn won an emmy for the creation of the superimposed yellow line representing the first down line for american football games.</UTT>cool beans ;)The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink - I wonder how that helps in... well - anything ;)</UTT>Good question.  Probably to make the opposing team feel girly./</UTT>opposing ? :) I would feel a little girly walking from a locker room like that :) lol</UTT>Haha, yeah the visitors.  No doubt.  Guess it's a slap in the face to the other team.  In the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football stars</UTT>oh wow... was bowling that popular in the 60's ? Quite hard to believe...</UTT>I know it is.  That's ridiculous junk there.</UTT>Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago - ? I didn't loose mine... ;) lol</UTT>That's a crazy statistic. Humans will regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2 - 3 months of having it surgically shortened.</UTT>Humans can regrow body parts ? How long was I sleeping tonight... lol ;)</UTT>Gracious, that's crazy.  Can you click done?</UTT>sure, You can't ? how come ?</UTT>I clicked it once.</UTT>and what happened ?</UTT>Notta
t_ab145228-19c9-42f2-9b46-65baee9f1c8e</CONV>Have you ever hiked? I haven't hiked by myself but I would be scared to do so.</UTT>I wouldn't want to go hiking with myself, but maybe it wouldn't be bad with a group. I wouldn't go in rugged areas though</UTT>I would want to make sure that I was prepared. Like that woman that went out to hike and had no snowshoes. Dangerous@!</UTT>Not only that, but she went closer to winter than most people do. I've heard of many people being inspired by the movie "Wild" to do things like that</UTT>I am not sure that my timid body would be inspired but I get it. So many people need an adrenaline rush. But that is just not me.</UTT>Me neither. I'm too much of a planner to venture on something that dangerous. The woman also didn't have any cell service, so she couldn't call for help when there was an emergency</UTT>No thanks! Do you have any pets? I have 2 dogs and they are a pain in the behind but also the best things ever!!</UTT>I don't have any pets. My roommate had a fish for a while, but it died a few months ago. The family I nanny for has a dog though, and she can be a pain sometimes</UTT>Well, it takes a lot to find the right dog but once you do...it is great. Did you know that google prefers dogs to cats...</UTT>I can see that with how many people have allergies to cats. Some dogs in Moscow have even been trained to use the subway</UTT>Nice, I heard that dogs are actually not colorblind but actually can not see as many diff colors as humans! That stinks</UTT>Maybe specific breeds are colorblind while others are not. Or it might be a gene that is passed down like it is through humans. How do we know if they are colorblind or not?</UTT>I am not sure! But did you know that elephants and dogs are the only animals who instinctively understand pointing?</UTT>That makes sense, though they sometimes choose to ignore it. Dogs also enjoy the experience of obtaining an award through problem solving. That's probably why they're relatively easy to train</UTT>Sometimes I feel bad that dogs don't give blood at blood drives. There are 12 diff blood types. That could help a ton of animals.</UTT>Bigger dogs would be able to give more blood, right? I can't imagine a teacup chihuahua being able to donate much</UTT>True! I used to have some Yorkies...they would have given millimeters! I can't like that Burger King had a promo where you unfriend 10 people on facebook and you get a whopper. Not worth it</UTT>Unless you're one of those people who has hundreds of friends on Facebook that you don't really know. I'm wondering how they would know who really did it or not</UTT>I know! If you are going to call anyone in the new york area the area code is 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary.</UTT>They were probably the first city to get their own phone numbers. The inventor of the dial was convinced the operators were rerouting his calls to rival businesses. He was an undertaker</UTT>so nice talking to you tonight!
t_9709cb25-f9fb-4905-9d4e-c420dec2fc22</CONV>Hi there, Do you know much about world presidents?</UTT>I know alot about presidents actually, for instance the only president to have a PhD was Woodrow Wilson. He was president in the early 20th century</UTT>That is amazing, good for him. DO you know who the three wealthiest US presidents in its history have been so far?</UTT>I think I do. one is probably Washington another is Jefferson, who is the third?</UTT>The third one is actually JFK. I guess we have to consider inflation there too</UTT>Yes I think so. I'm also shocked that Trump is not in the top three, and further I'm shocked that the last President to speak a foreign language fluently was FDR, that was a long time ago</UTT>That was a long time ago, I am surprised by that actually. Did you know the president of Indonesia is also a pop star?</UTT>No I didn't know that! What are some songs that he sang? I'll look them up. What are your thoughts on Guatemala by the way?</UTT>I am not sure of his songs as I have never heard them but the guy has already released three albums. Not sure if they like him or they listen to them because he is the President.</UTT>Haha that's a good point. did you know that Abraham Lincoln was the first president to be taken with a photograph on his inauguration? And John Wilkes booth was actually in that picture with him? That's so crazy</UTT>That is crazy indeed. Do you know how the vice president used to be elected prior to 1805? Wonder how that would work today.</UTT>Yeah that seems like it could be a problem today haha. Did you know that only five presidents have been elected while losing the popular vote? That's pretty nuts to me</UTT>To be honest I still do not get that very much but as well I guess this is how the system works. On another topic, do you attend concerts much?</UTT>I do. I do go to concerts from time to time. I never saw a Lou Reed concert though. Apparently him and his wife put on high-frequency concerts for dogs haha. I wonder how they know if the dogs like the music</UTT>I would love to go to one of those. I bet you they are better than that Creed concert that was so bad, people sued them.</UTT>That would be embarrassing LOL, do you like Abba by the way? they turn down a billion dollars to do a, 100 concert tour. That seems crazy, I know I would do taht</UTT>I wonder why they did that and yes, I actually like them quite a bit. Maybe someone needed to offer them that ancient theater in Croatia to perform there.</UTT>Yeah I would check that out! I would also check out a Foo Fighters concert, they did one so loud, that it showed up on seismic monitors back in New Zealand LOL</UTT>Wow, probably freaked them out at the station a bit. And did you know the Ramones toured for 20 years and played a staggering number of concerts, 2263 of them</UTT>That is staggering! Very impressive in my opinion, speaking of loud concerts though, Deep Purple broke a record back in 1972 for loudness, and three people actually were rendered unconscious, that's scary</UTT>That is scary and does not make for a very great concert going experience I would assume. It was super nice chatting with you. Have a great rest of the day :)
t_720fed76-611b-4f3b-8728-d629470fac17</CONV>Do you enjoy traveling.  I would like to go to the Netherlands where the Dutch has a bus that can go 160 MPH.</UTT>Yes, I would like to travel a lot more.  Travel is so easy and normalized now, there's even a website where you can find people that will let you stay at their house as you travel!</UTT>Yes.  Did you know the 1st king to travel around the world was king Kalakauua of Hawaii?  Hawaii has a king?</UTT>Yeah.  Another piece of interesting history is that rabbits were once released on islands to provide future food sources for other other travelers.</UTT>That's thinking ahead... Better than leaving toll booths like Japan.</UTT>I believe travel is a great source of enrichment and education.  There is so much to talk about when one returns from travel.</UTT>So, do you wear boots often.  Funny that Nokia go its start making rubber boots.</UTT>No, not often.  I am aware they have many uses though.  The military developed a boot that can be used in temperatures almost 60 degrees below zero.</UTT>Have you heard of Ugg boots?  I guess they were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after surfing.  I was surprised at how cold in water was in S. CA.</UTT>Yeah, that is smart.  I would like to go hiking more, I haven't been in decades, and I know I will need boots for that.</UTT>Same here but I have my old boots... Maybe you can buy them from Apple if they start making clothing again like they did in 1986.</UTT>Whatever boots I buy, it'd better not be made out of asbestos, the material the Greeks used to make clothing, because then I'd be paying for gold!</UTT>You might want to avoid Rip Curl.  They are N. Korean that falsely use China as a cover.  As if that's much better...</UTT>I am surprised that that an african tribe made the style of clothes of their former German occupiers their own style.</UTT>I'm surprised at how durable military clothing is and their wide use of wool.  One guy had a wool coat that weighed 8 pounds!</UTT>I wonder if any africans within that african tribe that was occupied by Germany dissented from wearing victorian clothes because they anyone who does as a traitor.</UTT>Probably and payed a dear price.  I'm not a big shopper.  Maybe I should buy military coats because the last longer.  Actually, all military stuff does, even their buttons.</UTT>Yeah, I imagine military clothing would be especially durable because they have to design it to withstand all kinds of conditions.</UTT>Yeah but I wonder if old soldiers can still fit in them.  I guess one soldier could as he wore the same shorts he did at his retirement ceremony some 50 years later.</UTT>I like the name the military gave to their special developed cold weather boots, "bunny boots", kind of a friendly and cute sounding name, for a group that is trained to kill.</UTT>That does seem a little weird.  Thanks for the chat!</UTT>Yes, thank you too.  Have a good day!  Bye!
t_c8e70d50-97b3-4b35-a0d8-1da4e83dca93</CONV>Hello!  Have you seen the Incredibles 2?</UTT>I haven't, have you?</UTT>I have.  I was surprised that it's already been 15 years since the first one came out in 2004.</UTT>What about Nintendo, do you play that?</UTT>I did!  I had the original one, then I think I had the super nintendo.</UTT>Did you know it only had 54 colors?</UTT>I believe it!  I think that was around before Bill Nye the science guy.</UTT>Hilarious, how did he get his start?</UTT>He won a Steve Martin look alike contest!</UTT>Serious? The actor? I don't see any resemblance whatsoever.</UTT>LOL  I know.  Speaking of actors...Ronald Reagan was once rejected for a movie role because they thought he didn't have a presidential look to him.  How funny.</UTT>Omg, that is hilarious. I always forget that he was an actor.</UTT>Yes.  Do you like Bill Murray at all?</UTT>I thought he was great in Groundhog day, did you see it?</UTT>I love that movie.  We still watch it a few times a year.</UTT>WOW! I haven't seen it in years. Does it stand the test of time?</UTT>Yes it does I think.  Bill Murray thinks that Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of the modern comedy age.  I don't believe I have seen that one.</UTT>I didn't like the Green Lantern film, did you?</UTT>I didn't care for it.  That was originally supposed to be a  comedy starring Jack Black.</UTT>Yeah, I don't think it was that great. Didn't know python programming was named after Monty Python.</UTT>I didn't know that either.  It was nice chatting with you!
t_d6010d2b-9f84-4dd3-9d95-efd22143ded5</CONV>Did you see Draymond Greens shirt after the NBA finals last year. He seems to like to ruffle feathers and talk smack.</UTT>Yeah I think I remember seeing that, he has been at the center of some questionable stuff recently.</UTT>I think he loves the attention he gets when he causes issues. He's a good player and has helped his team win 3 titles but also a headcase.</UTT>Yeah he is a good player all around and has helped them win the titles, but you are right.  They have a new player that is more of a headcase than him so maybe he will relax a bit.</UTT>Oh I didn't know there was a new headcase on the Warriors? Its hard to focus on those guys when they are stocked with Superstars.</UTT>Yeah it is, but now with Cousins on the team and back healthy, we'll see what happens.</UTT>Cousins seems to be adjusting quickly and getting back to form. It will be hard to knock them off in the playoffs. Even Lebron doesn't have enough help on the Lakers to do it.</UTT>Yeah I don't think Lebron has nearly enough fire power to beat them.  I think the Nuggets look like a tough matchup for them.</UTT>Nuggets have been really surprising but I don't know if I see them beating the Warriors in 7. Possibly Toronto or Milwaukee from the east could give them a run.</UTT>Yeah I am really hoping Milwaukee can reach the finals, they are my favorite team.  Do you follow any team?</UTT>I follow the Utah Jazz, they have some decent young guys up and coming but not enough fire power to crack the top 4 in the west. NBA has become a super team league.</UTT>Yeah I like the Jazz to make it to the 2nd round of the playoffs at least, they have some good young talent.</UTT>I think if the matchup is right they could get to the second round as well. They need some more players though. So Lebron probably wont win another MVP but possible harden or your guy on the bucks. Can't think of his name.</UTT>Yeah I think it is down to those 2 for sure.  Its Giannis, he has had an amazing year so far, our whole team has.</UTT>Yes Giannis thats it! He has a lot of good years ahead of him. It would be nice to see someone other then the Warrior win a title. Although I admire Curry's long ball, I remember watching Reggie Miller and thinking he could shoot, but Curry is so far ahead of anyone else.</UTT>Yeah Curry's shooting ability is just insane, I don't watch them too much but you have to appreciate the dominance.  But same here I hope it's two different teams in the finals.</UTT>Well I will route for Milwaukee and Utah to duke it out for 7 games. That would be fun to watch Gobert vs Giannis. Even though there are 30 NBA teams it some times feels like there is really only 5-6.</UTT>That would be awesome I can cheer for that.  And yeah I feel the same, look out for the 76er's though, next year they will be a powerhouse.</UTT>Yes they have some great young stars too. I think the East has finally caught up to the west. Boston could be scary good too if they start gelling as a team more. could be a really good playoffs this year.</UTT>Yeah Lebron leaves, and the east is strong again who would've thought.</UTT>Yeah he must be scared of the power in the east now. I need to go check out the standings on ESPN and see where teams are stacking up.</UTT>Yeah it should be fun to watch, anyways it was fun talking with you, I'll cheer on your Jazz out west to meet my Bucks here in the east.
t_b47e86e0-e155-4f09-98e9-61f2974c2591</CONV>I was reading that the white house has twin buildings in ireland and france</UTT>Very interesting! And how about that Michael Wolff scandal?</UTT>I actually don't know alot about that.  could you tell me some stuff</UTT>It seems he was staying in the West Wing.</UTT>what exactly happened</UTT>He wrote a book titled "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House". He told staffers he was there to write a book on the first 100 days of the White House transition.</UTT>So he wrote negative stuff and now they are upset with him Im guessing.</UTT>Yes, it made the White House look inept and amateurish.</UTT>I see that everyone each thought the other person had approved his access and didn't check to make sure it was ok.</UTT>He was also in Trump Tower in 2017.</UTT>Thats crazy.  I don't know how everyone could just let him have full access.  I mean I would think you would want to make sure nothing negative gets out</UTT>It seems he had just enough information from Trump and others to look like he was there to make corrections in news articles that had come out making a mockery of the president.</UTT>Then you worry that any information now in the white house is susceptible to getting out</UTT>On a lighter note, did you know that Bush had solar panels installed on the back of the White House?</UTT>no that is interesting. New technology and old technology.  I read that the white house still uses floppy disc in part for storing files</UTT>Very interesting fact! Did you ever hear of President Banana?</UTT>Wasn't he the first president of Zimbabwe?</UTT>YEs, you are very up to date on your presidential facts! On an unrelated subject; do you know that The Third Rock from the Sun won the Golden Globe?</UTT>Yes, he beat out seinfeld, friends and frasier.  that is really good!</UTT>1997 for best comedy series!</UTT>I have never watched it but it must be a really good series to have won!
t_976690e5-9523-431b-9acc-bba850da9e86</CONV>I love buying from Amazon!  Such good prices and anything imaginable to order.  I can't believe it's already been around for 24 years!</UTT>I know! I also find Amazon very convenient.  And I love that it is based in Seattle, Washington.</UTT>I wonder how the CEO of Amazon built a clock into a mountain that could run for 10,000 years.  I wonder why he did that too.</UTT>I did not know that.  I believe it's the largest retailer in the world and that the first costumer spend about $28 and has a building named after him.</UTT>If you need a package on Sunday, no problem!  Amazon has a contract with the USPS to get it to you.</UTT>My friend works in an Amazon warehouse, he tells me he gets about 10 miles of walking in everyday!</UTT>I can order so much from them it is great!  I've gotten audiobooks, video games, software, electronics, and even food!</UTT>Same.  But I have never ordered food.  Is it fresh when you get it?</UTT>The food was great!  Looked just like the commercial foods on tv.  Speaking of TV, I can't wait to watch some reruns of the Simpsons tonight.  I love Bart especially and am glad that he was in all the episodes but one as he is so humorous.</UTT>Simpsons is great!  I also like South Park.  When South Park aired its family guy episode, the Simpsons crew sent them flowers!</UTT>That was sweet!  I'll never get tired of watching Pokemon, especially since I have 750 episodes to choose from.  Are you a fan?</UTT>I was when I was younger.  I did not know there were 750 episodes!</UTT>I love being able to turn on my computer and search google for answers to just about anything.  I get more computing power than Neil Armstrong and the eleven astronauts that went to the moon used just in one search.</UTT>Ya, Google is amazing too.  I really love using google maps too.  It calculates traffic by tracking how fast android devices are moving on the road.  Isn't that incredible?</UTT>I like that Google really went green though when they used hundreds of goats to mow their headquarters lawn.</UTT>I have never heard of that!  When google goes down, it takes about 40% of web traffic with it.</UTT>I don't remember it in 1998, but perhaps they used it at Stanford University where it was founded by 2 Ph.D. students Larry Page and Sergey Brin.</UTT>I remember when they announced to reorganize their many interests into a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc.  I think that was back in 2015.</UTT>It would be fun to visit Googleplex, the headquarters in Mountain View, California.</UTT>Maybe if you go, you can meet the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai!</UTT>I'm sure I can learn a lot from the CEO and founders if I met them.  I would love to buy stock in them but I would have to take into account that 56% of the voting power would be held by Page and Brin.</UTT>That's a lot of power for just two people!</UTT>That sure is!  Nice talking to you!

I hope they are safe. Do you know who Tom Brady is?</UTT>Yes he is with the Patriots.</UTT>He recently said that parts of football were not fun. I wonder why?</UTT>I wonder why. He is so famous though and he makes so much money.</UTT>Yeah. I think it has to do with deflate-gate and how he was treated by the patriots.</UTT>Oh I see. That makes sense then. He has apparently never eaten a starwberry.</UTT>But they're so good. Does he know what he is missing out on?</UTT>I know right? they are so delicious</UTT>I use them in my protein shakes, So good! I heard he eats avocado ice cream. Have you ever had that?</UTT>Oh wow yes it is really nice. do you watch dramas?</UTT>I do. Do you?</UTT>Yes, I really like House.</UTT>Me too! I loved that show. I aspired to his level of snarkiness.</UTT>Yes. He made $700 000 for every episode</UTT>WOW! I would do 2-3 episodes and then retire to a nice coastal town and eat lobster rolls all day!</UTT>Oh yeah that would be nice. Do you know why Jim Carrey does not do dramas anymore?</UTT>I do not. Nice chatting with you!
t_abcad45f-4f66-4343-af9a-fab4ed155ae1</CONV>What do you see as some of the benefits of having children homeschooled?</UTT>The biggest being the problem with bullying and all the peer pressures</UTT>I definitely agree! I think one negative consequence of homeschooling is it does not provide easy access for a child to develop social skills with their peers.</UTT>I sort of agree with you there but there are ways to overcome that like boy/girl scouts; 4 H or sports</UTT>That could be beneficial, however, that would require a child to be interested in those fields. Simple things like knowing how to share, follow directions, and communicate with other kids are taught in kindergarten and gets gain that experience with interacting with their peers.</UTT>They can also socialize with other kids in the neighborhood</UTT>That could also be a possibility! I've heard about adolescents becoming homeschooled because they have intense anxiety; but I def don't think it should be for kids who just don't want to wake up early and go to school.</UTT>I think education is going to more virtual in the future as a way to save money</UTT>In what ways do you see it saving money?</UTT>Facilities would not have to be built; classrooms are remote</UTT>That is true, but it would require that children have the necessary resources for being able to be successful in the remote program (e.g., computers, books, etc.)</UTT>Computers and tablets are already saving schools and students money over textbooks</UTT>I can definetly see that occurring in your high SES schools, but low SES schools have trouble gaining access to your most basic resources. I think the education system should focus more on enhancing their curriculum to allow kids to be successful prior to thinking about ways they can cut down on money.</UTT>Agreed but the method of delivery is important too and not all students need it delivered in a traditional setting in a classroom</UTT>What are some ways outside a traditional classroom that you think students can learn?</UTT>The virtual classroom is being used in college and in vocational settings as well so I think High Schools can do it too</UTT>Yup! In Florida there is something called 'virtual PE' which is a pretty interesting altnerative to students taking a class in the gym.</UTT>Do you know more about it?  That is one class I have seen in a virtual setting before</UTT>From my understanding in the virtual PE class students have to record and upload videos of them doing specific exercises that they learn in their online modules. I believe they also learn about nutrition through the course.</UTT>The VR goggles might be of benefit for those classes too</UTT>You're right! That would definitely be very interesting. It was nice talking to you!
t_00e11ad5-20e0-4022-9815-2d3c2becfa52</CONV>Do you like comedy?</UTT>I do like comedy, have you heard of Kile Kinane? he is a pretty decent comedian.</UTT>I haven't actually. I like Gabriel Iglesias. I love how Kinane said that comedians are comedias because they are not good at other things. He seems pretty humble.</UTT>He does seem humble and he might be right lol, I dont know who Gabriel Iglesias is although I might google him later.</UTT>Kinane's tickets seem affordable so I would see him if he came to town.</UTT>Yeah it might be worth it, its only $25 and I bet you will laugh, I know I will go when he comes to town.</UTT>Do you like animated comedy? Have you watched Paradise PD?</UTT>No, I havent watched it, whats it about?</UTT>Apparently it is about a drug sniffing and drug addicted dog. I have not watched it either. Some people are offended at it because it is so crude.</UTT>That seems a bit strong speacially when kids might watch it, I wonder how comedians come up with all those funny lines.</UTT>Yeah, if you're not easily offended it might cause belly laughs though. I might have to check it out.</UTT>I love comedy films as well, you know Demetri Martin left Harvard out of boredom.</UTT>I did not know that. Glad it worked out for him but I would not recommend it to everybody. Ryan Stiles also dropped out of high school to pursue a career in comedy.</UTT>Yeah and also for Ryan Stiles, I bet his mom was really angry when he shared the news he was quitting high school to be a comedian.</UTT>Right. Did you ever watch 3rd rock fromthe sun, seinfeld, friends or frasier?</UTT>I warched Friends and Seinfield, why do you ask?</UTT>I also watched Friends and Seinfeld. I rarely watched 3rd Rock from the sun, but apparently it beat out all other comedies in 1997 for the Golden Globe Best Comedy Series.</UTT>I see, so anyway do you have a dog?</UTT>No, I do not. How about you?</UTT>I do have a dog and apparently dogs have 12 different bllod types.</UTT>Interesting. Dogs also vary so much in shape, size and colors.
t_ad9436bf-4289-42ea-8f2f-bf16a18aba43</CONV>Did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana? What do you suppose that was about?</UTT>Maybe it was a nickname. Hopefully it is seen a respectful one and not like some of the names that people have called our past presidents.</UTT>Yes we do seem to label our politicians good and bad depending on your view of them. Most of ours have been wealthy like JFK, Washington and Jefferson.</UTT>I'm surprised that Trump isn't on that list. Maybe it isn't completely up to date.</UTT>Trump isn't particularly rich compared to them. He over inflates his worth according to people who know. He's still got a lot more than I do.</UTT>I think if we went back to when the runner up was the vice president we would have more cooperation between the parties.</UTT>I agree. I wonder why they stopped that practice. It makes a lot of sense to me.</UTT>Who knows congress probably passed a law on it like they pass laws on their own salaries and pensions.</UTT>I know. Wouldn't it be nice to write your own ticket? Congress has lost a lot of respect over the years, beginning with Clinton they have become too party oriented.</UTT>it is just crazy to me that they can make laws about their own salaries. Like I would love to vote on how much i get paid.</UTT>I'm retired now but there was a time when I made a lot of money and I did discover that it really doesn't matter as long as your can provide and be happy.</UTT>That's true. I would rather be content with my crust of bread and a good family than be the richest person around and be all alone.</UTT>Yes. I have always managed to remain optimistic and happy. Like listening to your favorite music, it soothes your soul.</UTT>Music is amazing. I think it would be the best to go to concerts of some of my favorite bands.</UTT>You know, I've never been to a concert at all. I've driven my kids to them and sat in the car for hours waiting for it to be over. They love it but they always seem to be held a couple of hundren miles away.</UTT>I've never been to one either but I have friends that have. They seem to really love going. I wonder who holds the record for most concerts.</UTT>I don't know but I do know that the Ramones played over 2000 in 20 years of  touring. That's a lot of stops even over the course of time.</UTT>Wow that is a lot of concerts! I don't think I could spend that much time on a tour bus with people. That seems like a really cramped space.</UTT>I agree. I couldn't get along with anyone for that long. I wonder what a band makes for a concert. There has to be a huge expense to put one on.</UTT>It really does. I think Pink Floyd had the right idea though. Record a live concert and release the album</UTT>Yes, when I was a kid the venues were small, like clubs and theaters. The whole idea was just to promote new records, now they fill Madison Square Garden.</UTT>I think I would get such bad stage fright with a concert that size. Small settings wouldn't be so bad but something like that would be too much.
t_f093aa7d-940f-491b-83db-5e5087581a27</CONV>Have you heard of Wikileaks?</UTT>Yes, I am very interested in them and the secrets that they tell the public.</UTT>Yeah the founder fled to Russia Edward Snowden.</UTT>Yeah, I bet the government wished we would believe he is "fake news". I was amazed by a recent story of guy in Malaysia who was jailed for making a Youtube video, called fake news. Wow.</UTT>Jailed wow that's terrible kind of makes you grateful for the first amendment.</UTT>Yes, very good point and I agree with you completely. I guess he broke a law about speading lies?</UTT>But were they actually lies and who gets sentenced to 1 week in jail? That's ridiculous.</UTT>Ha, Ya I know right. I guess fake new has become a global phenomenon. But Malaysian isn't haven it.</UTT>Wow your right because apparently the online provider can be held accountable as well.</UTT>Yep thanks. China is another story. Did you know that the chinese government has censored the word "censorship". Hmmm.</UTT>Well another reason that i'm thankful to be living in this country.</UTT>I agree, yes. The United States government will publish anyone who renounces our country. They list their full names also.</UTT>Wow didn't know that, i'll have to check out the list make sure i'm not on it, lol! Apparently Fake news like you said is a buzz word, shots heard around the world.</UTT>Yeah, that would be scary! lol and Fake News isn't going away anytime soon. YouTube has looks of people saying crazy stuff, for sure. In 2007 Youtube consumed as much bandwidth as the entire internet in 2000. I am trying to wrap my mind around that.</UTT>I know right that's a lot of power. did you know the government owns 86% of Nevada?</UTT>That sounds about right since that is area "some number". If you're gonna drive around there it would be good to get the Google self-driving car and use the option "aggressive" mode.</UTT>Aggressive mode that sounds dangerous, lol.</UTT>Yeah, I guess Google needed to create that mode. I know that when Audi cars went to India they had to create a more aggressive horn to withstand how much they use it there.</UTT>I wonder what that sounds like? I never new that Detroit was founded by a French man who invented the Cadillac.</UTT>Oh, hmm, thats neat. I heard a cool story about a man in New york who bought a property and then found tons of classic cars. The barn on his property was loaded full of them.</UTT>Why can't stuff like that happen to me? Did you know that the drive thur was not created until the mid 70's?</UTT>Oh really, that was very long ago when you think about it. Why were they created, do you know?</UTT>For our soldiers who were not allowed out of the cars due to their uniforms. so i guess for safety reasons.</UTT>That's really cool, I like honoring our military whenever possible.. It was really good chatting with ya. Have a great rest of the day!

How about yourself?</UTT>I watch it from time to time. did you see the superbowl?</UTT>yeah it was kinda underwhelming I wish there were more points scored</UTT>Yeah, in the end when you think about it there is only 11 minutes of actual game play</UTT>I agree 100%. It didn't really get exciting till that last drive by Brady. Do you think he is the best NFL player of all time?</UTT>I am not sure about that there are some other really good players out there. maybe as a quarterback yeah</UTT>Yeah it's debatable. I think he is really talented and definitely in the discussion. Do you have a favorite NFL team?</UTT>I do not I just watch the games sometimes. do you know women can play too</UTT>Yeah some women can be really good at it. I play a lot of Fantasy with other girls in my league</UTT>Nice. did you know the rule about new orleans cheerleaders?</UTT>No I don't. What's the rule?</UTT>they are not allowed to eat in the same restaurant as the players</UTT>wow I didn't know that that's interesting. do you play Fantasy at all?</UTT>no I do not. I know that people fantasy drafts the national spelling bee</UTT>Yeah I heard about that on my team. This year I drafted Tyreek Hill and he was one of my best players</UTT>Nice. did you know that a single fold in the brain makes the different between fantasy and reality?</UTT>I didn't know that, that's super interesting. There's so much science regarding fantasy and its growing into so many different applications</UTT>very true. do you know who wrote ' in the realism of the unreal?</UTT>no I actually do not. who wrote that?</UTT>a janitor from chicago over six year</UTT>wow that's very cool. you think you're gonna go to an NFL game soon?
t_01fa6456-96f9-40a1-8329-cc7388c42f84</CONV>Hello, do you want to chat about the President, Library, or Barack Obama?</UTT>I like chatting about the Presidents.</UTT>Ok, Presidents it is.  Why don't we start with the definition?  The president is a common title for the head of state in most republics.  In politics, president is a title given to leaders of republican states. The US is a republic so it suits our leaders to a "T".</UTT>Did you know the first president of Zimbabwe was call President Banana?</UTT>Yes, how funny is that?  Did you know that the three wealthiest presidents in American history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson?</UTT>Yes, I wonder how much money they had in comparison to the amount of money people have now?</UTT>I'm not sure but I bet we could figure it out if we put our minds to it.  Did you know that up until 1805 in the US, that the runner up in a presidential election automatically became the Vice President? How would that work in today's world?</UTT>Would it have been the runner up in the same party as the winner or the people with the most votes? Could you imagine Trump and Hillary working together.</UTT>Wow, that would be something to watch.  I'm not sure about the details, again we'd have to Google it but it sounds interesting.  On a lighter note, did you know that the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?  He was singing all the way to the bank, I bet.</UTT>That's funny. Trump has been on a lot of reality tv.</UTT>Strange as it may seem, did you know that the US president's guest house is larger than the White House? I would love to see that.</UTT>I wonder why that is? You would think that it would be the other way around.</UTT>I know, right? Do you know anything about libraries?  Did you know that there are more libraries than McDonald's in the US and over half of all adults have library cards?  That's a good one.</UTT>I have a library a half block away from my house and McDonald's is about 4 blocks. My library card has expired.</UTT>Mine expired years ago, since the Internet I don't need it anymore.  The Sacramento Public Library started a "library of things" and allowed people to check out short-term use items like sewing machines.  That's a cool idea.</UTT>That really is a great idea. I don't think our library does that.</UTT>Many good ideas are out there! If you publish a book in Norway, the government will buy 1000 copies and distribute them to libraries throughout the country.</UTT>What if it is a bad book?  It would seem to be a waste of paper.</UTT>You've got a good point, hopefully they do a good job of screening them first.  Also, the Norway government will buy 1,500 if it's a children's book. I don't have the specifics on that one either.</UTT>I'm not sure what the purpose of that would be. What if no one wanted to see it.</UTT>Your guess is as good as mine. Well, it's time to say goodbye, nice chatting with you.
t_6cf196d8-2c0c-45d6-92a2-326fd1a4e234</CONV>Good evening!  Just jumping on the internet to see what is going on.  I hope I am not addicted to it!</UTT>Haha :)  Good evening! I have accepted my addiction.</UTT>Lol!  It's all those links we get to press I guess.</UTT>Indeed!  So if I may ask, what do you think about the situation with Iran?</UTT>It seems like everything there is unclear and confusing.  Sometimes I forget what our primary policy is with them.  I believe there is quite a bit of unrest in the country now.  What about you?</UTT>I agree.  It is a mess over there.  With the revolutionaries in the mix, it is totally uncertain what will become of the state.</UTT>I thought a little bit about how it was in for Ceausecsu, former dictator of Romania, but I just don't think Iran will see the same sort of single mass event to get their aims.</UTT>I must agree again.  History has shown that a non-violent course of action has lead to successful revolution more than half of the time.  That path is much faster as well, usually it takes less than half as long.  My concern is their nuclear capability...</UTT>That is a legitimate fear, especially when relations are often cool with Iran.  One way for us to respond is to let the truth filter to Iranians who currently have a lot of internet related restrictions that may prevent them from hearing any non-Iranian perspectives.</UTT>Absolutely.  One thing I think we could be doing is providing access to the uncensored internet via satellite.  Whatever action the U.S. takes has to be done low-key.  The last time we messed around with their government, the Shah was overthrown for the current dictatorship.</UTT>Which didn't work in our favor at all</UTT>Not one bit.  Now we have a hostile government and an Iranian population that is outspokenly against us.  I think giving them access to the internet would also help stimulate their stagnant economy.</UTT>Ever wish the world was just a simpler place?  Maybe having a President Banana, like Zimbabwe did, or maybe even an active president that has time to release pop albums like the one in Indonesia?</UTT>Now there is an idea lol.  Yes, a simpler world would be great!  I wonder if his albums were any good :)</UTT>LOL!  What if it was required of all tax payers to purchase, or maybe a sing-off national debate to help make the decision?  If it happened here, our ears would still be in pain though!</UTT>:P no doubt.  In Iran's case I think the balance between freedoms of the people and the authority of the state is skewed so badly that most Iranian's are simply afraid of persecution if they oppose it</UTT>I feel for the Iranians, but I would wish to trade places with them.  We definitely have problems, but hopefully revolution isn't around the corner.</UTT>We couldn't survive a new revolutionary war I fear.  The population is too divided and I believe it would degenerate into another civil war :/  At least the information we host online would be safe; the library in Alexandria has saved a copy of the internet.</UTT>True.  I'd like to think that if we can get 3g service on Mt. Everest, we can figure out how to solve the problems we collectively face as humans,</UTT>One would surely hope so.  It is amazing that we have coverage even in such a remote location. It would be a shock were we to have to return to the printed word for our information.</UTT>Time for dinner, but great chat!  Let's hope that things go as smoothly and non-violently as possible in Iran!</UTT>For sure!  Thier success or failure will have a notable effect on the stability of the region.   Well, thanks and enjoy you dinner!</UTT>Thanks again!  Have a good week.
t_a00e54e3-c896-4dcf-89f2-d21910b8db2a</CONV>Can you believe the first president of Zimbabwe was called "President Banana"? That's pretty crazy</UTT>hahaha thats wierd.  1988 a chimpanzee received 400.000 votes in a mayoral election in rio de janeiro, coming in third place.</UTT>I mean, politicians, apes, there isn't much of a difference haha</UTT>haha true.The only us president to have a phd is woodrow wilson</UTT>Yeah, I think a bunch of them got honorary PHDs too, but he's the only one that earned it.</UTT>what is that Honorary Phd,  they just give that to you?</UTT>Yeah, it's pretty meaningless, just sort of a University's way to honor success and service</UTT>haIf all of canada was one state in the us, it would have 50 electoral votes , fewer than california.</UTT>Yeah, Canada isn't that big at all. California is huge, it's got like 40 million people</UTT>Canada seems huge on the map though.  I guess the population is just more spread out.</UTT>Yeah, it's mostly along the US border, and it's actually smaller than depicted on most of the maps because of the Mercator projection.</UTT>In 2000 40 percent of alabamans voted to keep the state's unenforceable ban on interracial marriage</UTT>Also, 34% of their black male population have permanently lost the right to vote.</UTT>oh right I read that.  I wonder why though</UTT>I think most of it has to do with being a convicted felon, but I could be wrong</UTT>That makes sense.  5 presidents have been elected while still losing the popular vote. greatest margin 10%</UTT>Yeah, and in 6 out of the last 7 elections Republicans have lost the popular vote. I think the only one that won it was Bush in 2004</UTT>Thats interesting.</UTT>Yeah, it's crazy to think that majority doesn't always win</UTT>I know right.  Like the previous election.</UTT>Yeah, I think Trump lost by a couple million votes, but that's what gerrymandering does to elections</UTT>Good talking to you,  have a good one.
t_82d7ae9d-58ad-4a03-b9f3-6267f6d4fb11</CONV>Hello, do you like to watch TV?</UTT>I do. What do you like to watch?</UTT>Right now Arrow, The Flash and Supergirl, and also Lethal Weapon, what about you?</UTT>I missed some 'old' tv shows and have been watching The Office, Parks and Rec, and House recently. Also like the Simpsons</UTT>Those are  really cool, I love the Simpsons, crazy how there's one episode without Bart in it, his like the star of the show</UTT>And Homer has 188 jobs (I assume this also refers to flashbacks?)</UTT>I do recall him changing jobs a lot during the first seasons, that was really funny</UTT>Do you watch award shows at all?</UTT>I did, I watched the Oscars this year, do you agree with the winners?</UTT>Didn't watch. I do see that john williams has been nominated for more oscars than anyone but disney. Quite a career!</UTT>The actor of the movie Queen won an Oscar, I have to agree with that, he did a great job in the movie,</UTT>Rami Malek? I heard he did amazing too</UTT>Yeah that's the one, can't believe it's almost 100 years since the creation of the Academy Awards</UTT>100 years? quite the institution!</UTT>Yeah a lot of history, do you know who holds the record for more awards?</UTT>Disney?</UTT>Yeah thats the one, 22 Oscars under his name, impressive</UTT>22 more than me!</UTT>Yeah, 22 more than me too, Eminem also has an Oscar or two</UTT>Really? For what?</UTT>Not sure, but he has more oscars than Lucas, Depp, Smith, Decaprio and Murray combined,
t_72205549-37b2-4d01-8b57-17761fa1c697</CONV>Do you read poetry ?</UTT>Sometimes although not very often.</UTT>Me too, I don't think it was ever popular, Edgar Allen Poe was paid 9$ for his poem the Raven.</UTT>Wow really? I do enjoy Edgar Allen Poe, I like the macbre dark tones it has. I would think poetry would be more popular during his time period, if any time at all.</UTT>Maybe it was popular in ancient times, when playing with words could be seen as entertainment. Nowadays, we have Disney.</UTT>This is true, Disney has been a huge influence for many movie studios. It' considered one the the "Big Six" film studios</UTT>I was surprised of that I thought that Disney since the beginning was a big studio, with the Mickey movies.</UTT>Yea its also really interesting how they are keeping up with social reform. Frozen was the first animated Disney film directed by a woman</UTT>It took more than 60 years ! That is not really progressive. But they are kind of slow, Wreck-it-Ralph was started in the 80s.</UTT>They might have been afriad to be too progressive since it is such a family oriented film company.</UTT>I think they are more focused on making money, they involve the toy industry before the film production.</UTT>That could also explain why in the 70's they recycled much of their animation frames, resulting in identical scenes in some movies, cost cutting measures?</UTT>Probably, animation is a costly process, if you want to make money, you have to cut down the drawing as much as possible.</UTT>I guess so. I don't really know that much about the animation side of things. With Pixar being a part of the same brand. Pixar movies are so detailed!</UTT>What would be you favorite Disney movie, including  Pixar ?</UTT>Ah! That's a tough one but I'd have to classic Disney and choose Peter Pan, there's just something so magical about that movie. What about you?</UTT>I like the Lion King, it has a Shakespearean feeling to it. It was the first Disney film dubbed in Zulu.</UTT>I've read that it has connection to Shakespeare and that's interesting about the Lion King. Is it the first dubbed ever or first dubbed in Zulu?</UTT>Disney films are dubbed in many languages, like French, since the beginning. Lion was the first dubbed in Zulu.</UTT>Ohh! I had no idea. Thats good thought. Make sure they are reaching all corners of the world!</UTT>Today, I don't think you can be one the the "Big Six" studios without the international market.</UTT>Espcially coming from a powerhouse like Disney.. Have you ever been to Disney World or Disneyland?</UTT>I have been to Disney World in Florida, never been in California.</UTT>I have been to Disney World so many times, it was a popular vacation spot for my family growing up. I've been to Disneyland but only once and I unfortunately don't remember a bunch of details, just that it was so much smaller!
t_cb4abc4e-4712-478d-9bd2-bd20ead35b59</CONV>It must be hard to watch your first born or any of your kids go to college, hard to let go sometimes.</UTT>I am surprised how fast time flies.  The article I read about the lady's first born leaving for college hit lots of my buttons when our two children left home.</UTT>Its a lot to process, are you a parent? I can relate to the article my firstborn is soon leaving to college as well</UTT>I am the parent of two adult sons.  The are in their young 20s.  One visited us this weekend.  Adult children are enjoyable.  College life is certainly different than when I attended.</UTT>Oh I see so you must relate to the article as well, its hard when you are all alone in your home and your kids are gone</UTT>We downsized from our family home of 20 years in 2017, and enjoying living in a condo on the lake.  Busy during the summer, but quiet this time of year.</UTT>I see, so changing the subject a bit, do you like cars?</UTT>Yes I enjoy a good car ride.  I prefer to drive in rural areas and enjoy the scenery rather than in hustle bustle of city driving.</UTT>I enjoy to drive as well watching all kinds of different landscapes on the way, interesting but the trunk of the car got its name because of the old wooden trunks some cars had in the back</UTT>I find it surprising that drive thrus were not available until 1975!  I remember car hops bringing root beer floats to my parents car that was parked at the restaurant, but seems like drive thrus have been around forever.</UTT>It does seem that way, McDonalds created a great service without knowing it would impact us all</UTT>Are you a dog owner?  Our dog likes going through the drive through of any business because there are treats to be had.  He especially likes the kiddie ice cream cones our local McDonald's gives him.</UTT>I am a dog owner, and that's great I wonder if McDonald's is a dog company, I know Google is one.</UTT>Yes I agree Google is a dog company, but I learned recently that dogs are not truly color blind, they just do not see all the different colors we see.</UTT>Yeah they can see colors just not as many as we do, dogs are really smart along with elephants they are the only animals that understand pointing, mine is not so clever though</UTT>Ha ha.  Our dog is very smart and can tell by the shoes we put on when leaving the house if he is going with us or not.  Also recently learned there are twelve different blood types found in dogs, and there is such as thing as a blood drive for dogs.</UTT>Maybe he can tutor my dog lol, and 12 different types of bloods, that's more than humans right?</UTT>I believe humans have three primary blood types, A, B, O but then each of those blood types then can be combined and also negative or positive.  I might have to take a trip to the library to find out the exact number, but pretty sure not twelve blood types in humans.</UTT>I see, so not as much as dogs then, its amazing how they evolved from wolves and now there are many different species around the world, dogs are loyal and that's why I like them more than cats.</UTT>Dogs were the first animals to be domesticated and certainly found a great place in the American household.  Much different than when dogs "worked" on farms.  I work in a children's hospital and we have working dogs there to visit with the kids.  Our dog would be too rowdy and too pampered to work.</UTT>I agree, well a lot of interesting facts about dogs I might go to the library and check out a book or two.
t_66914410-e890-4b4e-9d34-9b5459fcec98</CONV>do you watch football</UTT>No, not normally, but I did get into Fantasy Football. I didn't know that the Green Bay Packers was the third oldest, did you?</UTT>I play fantasy football too.  I did not know Packers was the third oldest</UTT>I'm sorry, I meant to say third oldest franchise. I normally find football boring and didn't understand how they kept track of the players and the ball. It seemed like fanciful thinking. But apparently they have tracking chips in their shoulder pads and on the ball.</UTT>I think they also have camera to track.  Do you know Packers have sold out all of their ticket games since 1960</UTT>That definitely makes sense. I figured they were well loved because they appeared in the movie Pitch Perfect, and the fact that an NFL game only has about 11 minutes of live play. So most people want the actual experience of seeing their fave team. Do you know how long they've been a franchise?</UTT>I do not know.  But the whole American football stuff began before 1900s</UTT>Really? I thought people would be playing like...well, not much back in the 1800s. I thought the earliest might have been the 1900s, because the Packers were formed in 1919</UTT>It was just my guess. Do you know there are only 17 regular NFL games</UTT>What do you mean by NFL games? Like, teams or types of games they played?</UTT>Each team plays a total of 17 games during the regular season, not including the playoff</UTT>It always seems like so much more! So, quick question, how do you feel about female players in the NFL?</UTT>I do not like that though</UTT>Did you know there isn't actually a rule against women playing? I kind of think that if they meet the eligiblity requirements, that they can definitely hold their own. I mean, it would be better than being a cheerleader.</UTT>hahaha.  I concur.  Do you know there are total 32 NFL teams</UTT>I didn't, it seems like there is just....and endless amount of teams playing. I always wondered how many there were. Would you want to be a football player or an engineer?</UTT>I rather be an engineer because the game is extremely dangerous</UTT>The lifetime earnings of an engineer is more than that of an NFL player and MLB player. Plus I imagine your medical bills and therapy bills (for after your 3rd concussion) would be cheaper and almost non-existent. Haha!</UTT>I concur.  It is not worth it all.</UTT>So do you know any like, quirky information or offhand knowledge about any players? Like, I found out that the circular huddle they use today was created by Paul D. Hubbard so the other team couldn't read his hand signals because he was deaf.</UTT>Never knew that.  But it was interestiong.  By the way, nice chatting with you
t_7c443b25-b870-4e52-8986-cadb22fe0264</CONV>Do you like bird? maybe have birdwatching as one of your hobbies?</UTT>I like birds but I'm not an official birdwatcher.  I am a bit surprised to learn that the dodo bird is a real thing.  The are actually part of the pidgeon family.</UTT>They are? I thought dodo birds were ficticious or extinct at least, you know that some birds travel really long distances without a rest</UTT>So did I.  Did you know that hummingbirds are known to take spiderwebs to use on their nests?  Little thieves...</UTT>They do? I guess spiders must be angry at them then lol, you know that most birds have bones that are so hollow that their skeleton weights even less than their feather!!</UTT>Yeah, I bet there are a lot of bird-hating spiders.  I did know that but the wild birds of Australia have an added talent: they can mimic the sounds of stuff like car alarms and chainsaws.</UTT>That must be interesting, I would love to hear a bird that sounds like a chainsaw lol, that bird has some identity issues for sure.</UTT>Yep, some bird therapy is in order.  FYI: I grew up on a ranch.  We had many horses but I didn't know one could be allergic to them.  Clint Eastwood is.</UTT>He is? thats weird considered he has done many movies that involved horses and him riding them,</UTT>Yeah, an occupational hazard for sure... I didn't know that firefighters used dalmations to calm horses.  Most of our horses didn't really care for dogs.</UTT>Thats an interesting fact did you also hear the story about the two kids that got suspended because they showed up riding horses to school?</UTT>Yeah, my dad used to ride horses to school in west Texas.  Man, horses go way back to 4000 BCE.  I wonder how they know that...</UTT>Yeah right? it seems like a difficult string of data to know, Icelandic horses must be really fast,</UTT>Yep. We had quarter horses and they are no slouches at speed.  I can see why it took 45-55 million years for them to evolve.</UTT>I wonder whats the main difference between wild horses and caballus? I guess a wild horse can become a cabullus</UTT>A cowboy would say, "they ain't broke yet".  A cowboy would also have little use for rap.  Do you like rap?</UTT>I do, one of my favorite Rappers is Tupac, do you like rap?</UTT>I have a handful of songs on my phone.  Funny that Eminem wanted to be a comic book artist.</UTT>It is funny, good thing he didnt I love his music, do you know who Busta Rhymes is?</UTT>I remember him from the 90's. I've never heard of Korean rappers and their "compliment battle."  Hmm.  Well, if this is the last go-around, it's been nice talking with you.  Take care.</UTT>That sounds weird, a compliment war, that must be fun to watch and well Busta Rhymes voice the reptar wagon in the Rugrats Movie back in 1998</UTT>Yes it does.  What does it even mean?
t_a352eca3-234d-4e4f-a9db-a97efcba1615</CONV>Do you use Google often?  It was founded in 1998.</UTT>Yea every day, It's amazing how big it got for being founded by Page and Brin when they were only PhD students</UTT>I hear "Larry Page" as google founder often but I don't hear about Brin very much.  I wonder why.</UTT>Who knows, I guess Brin cares more about owning 14 percent of the company rather than the spotlight</UTT>I think this fact is unbelievable "a single google search requires more computing power than it took to send neil armstrong and eleven other astronauts to the moon".  Is it true?</UTT>It's possible, google does use about 0.01% of the world's electricity</UTT>Thanks for the info.  When google went down for 5 minutes on August 16, 2013, it took 40% of the web traffic with it.</UTT>That's scary, I
